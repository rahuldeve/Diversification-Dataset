Abstract: 
Since industrialization, human activities have significantly altered the atmospheric composition, leading to 
climate  change  of  an  unprecedented  character.  The  global  mean  temperature  is  expected  to  increase 
between 1.4 to 5.8oC over the next hundred years. The consequences of this change in global climate are 
already being witnessed in the Himalayan glaciers and glacial lakes. The Himalayan glaciers are retreating 
at  rates  ranging  from  10  to  60  metres  per  year  and  many  small  glaciers  (<0.2  sq  km)  have  already 
disappeared. Vertical shift of glaciers as great as 100m have been recorded during the last fifty years.  With 
the  result  of  retreating  glaciers,  the  lakes  are  growing  in  number  and  size  as  well  in  the  Himalaya.  A 
remarkable example is Lake Imja Tsho in the Everest region; while this lake was virtually nonexistent in 
1960, now it covers nearly 1 sq km in area. Similar observations were made in the Pho Chu basin of the 
Bhutan Himalaya, where the change in size of some glacial lakes has been as high as 800 per cent over the 
past  40  years.  At  present,  several  supraglacial ponds  on  the  Thorthormi  glacier  are  growing  rapidly  and 
consequently merging to form a larger lake. These lakes pose a threat of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), 
and GLOFs are often catastrophic on life and property of the mountain people living downstream. At least 
thirty-two GLOF events recorded in Himalaya that resulted in heavy loss of human lives and their property, 
destruction  of  infrastructure  besides  damages  to  agriculture  land  and  forests.  The  global  warming  in  the 
coming decades will amplify the GLOF events with the accelerating retreat of glaciers and formation of 
many potentially dangerous glacial lakes.  Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes are utmost important to 
understand the status of the lake and need to prioritized for the installation of early warning systems and 
mitigation measures before planning the mountain infrastructure for the sustainable development. Regional 
cooperation is also required for knowledge management on GLOF issues due to trans-boundary nature of 
GLOF phenomena.  
 
Introduction 
The Himalayan cryosphere, the water tower of the world, is the source of major river systems in 
Asia, the lifeline of more than 1.3 billion people living in the downstream valley. Climate change 
is causing the net shrinkage and retreat of glaciers and the increase in size and number of glacial 
lakes. Generally the glaciers and glacial lakes are spatially distributed in the high elevation as well 
as in the rugged terrain of remote areas. Most of these lakes had formed only on the second half of 
twentieth century due to global warming. The climate variability and global climatic change has 
brought significant impact on the high mountainous glacial environment. The glaciers are melting 
rapidly resulting initial increase in river runoff, which will reduce after certain time period below 
a critical threshold and formation, merging and expansion of glacial lakes to the stage of glacial 
lake outburst floods. Both of these phenomena will have the adverse impact on the livelihoods of 
the people living downstream. There are at least thirty-two recorded GLOF events in Nepal, Tibet 
Autonomous Region of China and Bhutan. 
 
The  impact  of  a  GLOF  event  in  downstream  is  quite  extensive  in  terms  of  damage  to  roads, 
bridges, trekking trials, villages, and agricultural lands as well as the loss of human live and other 
infrastructure. The sociological impacts can be direct when human lives are lost or indirect when 
the agricultural lands are converted to debris filled lands and the village has to be shifted. The 
records of past GLOF events show that once in every three to ten years a GLOF has occurred in 
Himalaya  with  varying  degrees  of  socio-economic  impact.  Therefore,  proper  monitoring  of 
potential  GLOF  and  early  warning  systems  should  be  implemented  to  reduce  the  physical 
vulnerability in the watersheds of the Himalayan region. 
 
 

 
Global climate change and climate projection 
Since  industrialization,  human  activities  have  resulted  in  steadily  increasing  concentrations  of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to fears of enhanced greenhouse effect.  The worlds 
average  surface  temperature  has  increased  between  0.3  and  0.6oC  over  the  past  hundred  years. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its third assessment report, revealed 
that  the  rate  and  duration  of  the  warming  in  the  20th  century  is  larger  than  at    any  other  time 
during  the  last  one  thousand  years.  The  1990s  was  likely  to  be  the  warmest  decade  of  the 
millennium  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere,  and  the  year  1998,  the  warmest  year  (IPCC,  2001a). 
According  to  the  World  Meteorological  Organization  (WMO),  the  mean  global  temperature  in 
2005 is deviated by +0.47C from the average of the normal period 1961 -1990. It is thus one of 
the  warmest  years  and  currently  ranks  as  the  second  warmest  year  worldwide  (Faust,  2005), 
similarly year 2002 and 2003 will be the 3rd and 4th hottest years, respectively ever since climate 
statistics have been monitored  and documented began in 1861. 
 
According  to  the  IPCC,  2001  and  their  assessments  based  on  climate  models,  the  increase  in 
global temperature will continue to rise during the 21st century. The increase in the global mean 
temperatures by 2100 could amount anything from 1.4 to 5.8C, depending on the climate model 
and  greenhouse  gases  emission  scenario.  On  the  Indian  sub-continent  average  temperatures  are 
predicted to rise between 3.5 and 5.5C by 2100 (Lal, 2002). An even higher increase is assumed 
for  the  Tibetan  Plateau.  There  are  several  predicted  future  scenarios  for  the  climate  in  the 
Himalayan region and it may be hazardous to speculate too much in which one that will come 
closest  to  the  truth.  However,  it  is  quite  clear  that  temperatures  will  increase,  but  difficult  to 
estimate how much.  
 
Impact of climate change on glaciers 
These  changes  in  climate  will  inevitably  interact  with  changes  in  glaciers  and  glacial  lakes. 
Results show that the recession rate has increased with rising temperature. A forecast was made 
that up to a quarter of the global mountain glacier mass could disappear by 2050 and up to half 
could be lost by 2100 (Kuhn, 1993a; Oerlemans, 1994; and IPCC, 1996b). For example, with the 
temperatures rise by 1C,  Alpine glaciers have shrunk by 40% in area and by more than 50% in 
volume since 1850 (IPCC, 2001b & CSE, 2002). Evidences have been conclusive enough to make 
glacier  melting  as  an  important  indicator  for  climate  change.  The  net  shrinkage  and  retreat  of 
glaciers causing the increase in size and number of glacial lakes and thereby the posssibility of 
increase  in  frequency  of  GLOFs  in  coming  years.  These  changes  in  climate  will  have  effects 
ultimately on life and property of mountain people. 
 
Glacier retreat in China 
Numerous studies were carried out during 1999-2001 lend credence to the link between climate 
change  and  glacier  melting.  All  the  glaciers  (Valley)  in  the  Himalaya  have  retreated  by 
approximately a kilometer  since the Little Ice Age [AD 1550-1850] (Mool P.K et al, 2001a). A 
long-term study entitled, The Chinese Glacier Inventory, by the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
has reported that during the last 24 years there has been a 5.5% shrinkage in volume of Chinas 
46,928 glaciers, equivalent to the loss of more than 3000 sq km of ice. The study predicts that if 
climate continues to change at the present rate, two-thirds of Chinas Glaciers would disappear by 
2050, and almost all would be gone by 2100 (China Daily, 23 September 2004). Evidence have 
been  conclusive  enough  to  make  glacier  melting  and  retreat  an  important  indicator  for  climate 
change. 
 
One of the study carried out by ICIMOD in 2004 (Mool et al, 2004) in the Poiqu basin of Tibet 
Autonomous Region of P R China revealed that the glaciers area has been decreased by 5.04% 
within 12 years during 1988 to 2000. The study also remarked that the Valley glaciers with IDs 

5O191B0029 and 5O191C0009 on the eastern slope of the Xixiabangma mountain retreating 45m 
and 68m per year respectively with the expansion of associated glacial lakes (Figure 1).

Glacier retreat in India 
Earlier  studies  on  selected  glaciers  of  Indian  Himalaya  indicate  that  most  of  the  glaciers  are 
retreating  discontinuously  since  post-glacial  time.  Of  these,  the  Siachen  and  Pindari  Glaciers 
retreated at a rate of 31.5m and 23.5m per year respectively (Vohra, 1981). Gangotri Glacier is 
retreating at an average rate of 18m per year Thakur et al. (1991). Shukla and Siddiqui (1999) 
monitored the Milam Glacier in the Kumaon Himalaya and estimated that the ice retreated at an 
average rate of 9.1m per year between 1901 and 1997. Dobhal et al. (1999) monitored the shifting 
of snout of Dokriani Bamak Glacier in the Garhwal Himalaya and found 586m retreat during the 
period  1962  to  1997.  The  average  retreat  was  16.5m  per  year.  Matny  found  Dokriani  Bamak 
Glacier  retreated  by  20m  in  1998,  compared  to  an  average  retreat  of  16.5m  over  the  previous 
thirtyfive years. (Matny, L., 2000). 
 
Geological Survey of India (Vohra, 1981) studied the Gara, Gor Garang, Shaune Garang, Nagpo 
Tokpo Glaciers of Satluj River Basin and observed an average retreat of 4.22 - 6.8 m/year. The 
Bara Shigri, Chhota Shigri, Miyar, Hamtah, Nagpo Tokpo, Triloknath and Sonapani Glaciers in 

the  Survey  of 

suggest 

Chenab River Basin retreated at the rate of 6.81 to 29.78 m/year. The highest and lowest retreat 
was in the Bara Shigri Glacier and Chhota Shigri Glacier respectively. 
  
During the period 1963 -1997, Kulkarni and others found the retreat of Janapa Glacier by 696m, 
Jorya Garang by 425m, Naradu Garang by 550m, Bilare Bange by 90m, Karu Garang by 800 m 
and Baspa Bamak by 380m (Kulkarni et al 2004). They further observed a massive glacial retreat 
of 6.8 km (178 m/year) in Parbati Glacier in Kullu District during 1962 to 2000. In their studies 
they observed an overall 19 percent 
retreated  in  glaciated  area  and  23 
percent in glacier volume in last 39 
years.  
 
Based  on  the  field  survey  carried 
out  in  1999,  the  snout  of  Shaune 
Garang  Glacier  was  marked  at  an 
elevation  of  4460  masl  in  contrast 
to 
India  1962 
topographic map, which marked the 
snout  at  an  altitude  of  4360  masl 
(Philip  and  Sah  2004).  This  is 
indicating  a  vertical  shift  of  100m 
and  horizontal  shift  of  1500m 
within  a  span  of  37  years.  These 
observations  also 
that 
global warming has affected snow-
glacier  melt  and  runoff  pattern  in 
the  Himalaya.  One  of  the  best 
examples of glacier retreat is shown 
in the (Figure 2) where the position 
of Gangotri Glacier snout has been 
shifted  about  2km  upward  from 
1780 to 2001 and is in a continuous 
process.

Glacier retreat in Bhutan 
Karma et al (2003) found the glacier retreat by 8.1% in 66 glaciers studied from the topographic 
map of 1963 and the satellite image of 1993. The glaciers area was 146.87 sq km in 1963 and 
decreased to 134.94 sq km in 1993 during these 30 years. The shrinkage of the smaller glaciers 
has the higher rate than the larger glacier. Some small glaciers of 0.1 to 0.2 sq km area glaciers 
are disappeared completely in 1993. 
 
Ageta et al (2000) reported remarkable retreat of debris covered glacier in Lunana basin. Lugge 
Glacier retreated by 160m/yr from 1988 to 1993 with the high growth rate of Lugge Tsho Lake, 
Raphsthreng Glacier retreated 35m/yr in general from 1984 to 1998 but during 1988 to 1993 the 
retreat  rate  was  60m/yr.  The  Tarina  Glacier  retreat  rate  was  35m/yr  from  1967  to  1988.  The 
Lunana  basin  is  the  one  where  series  of  Glaciers  and  Glacial  Lakes  are  in  the  cascading  form 
(Figure 3). Due to retreat of glaciers the associated glacial lakes are growing in size shown by 
Gurung  and  Karma  2006  (Figure  4).  One  of  the  prominent  observations  in  the  decadal 
development  of  glacial  lakes  show  the  rapid  growth  of  glacial  lakes  immediately  after  the 
formation till to certain level except in Drukchung Glacier.

Glacier retreat in Nepal 
Since 1970s some glaciers from Kanchenjunga, Khumbu, Langtang, and Dhaulagiri region have 
been studied by different scholors to understand the glaciers activity and found the glacier retreat 
dramatically  increased  in  the  period  between  1994  and  1998  (Figure  5).  Asahi  et  al  from 
Glaciological  Expedition  in  Nepal  (GEN,  2006)  measured  the  glacier  retreat  in  Khumbu  and 
Shorang regions positioning the benchmarks in the vicinity of the termini on 19 small debris free 
glaciers. They found glacier retreat in Shorang region of around 8 m/year where as in the Khumbu 
region is 5 to 10 m/year and also remarked that the glacier retreat rate is accelerating since 1990.  
 
Till  now  the  overall  glacier  activity  study  in  Nepal  is  unknown.  Except  in  sporadic  study  of 
individual  glaciers  mainly  the  valley  glaciers,  the  first  attempt  of  study  of  glaciers  and  glacial 
lakes  throughout  the  country  was  carried  out  by  ICIMOD  in  2001,  which  provide  the  baseline 
information of glaciers and glacial lakes.

The supraglacial lakes mostly formed at the tongue of the glacier moraine. In some the moraine 
consist dead ice core. Most of the large glacial lakes had grown from the small supraglacial lake. 
Due  to  melt  of  ice  core the  supraglacial  lakes  expanded  and  formed  as  moraine  dammed  lake. 
Some of the lakes studied in detail since from the beginning of the lake formation show the rate of 
lake extension is propertional to glacier retreat. For example the Imja Tsho glacial lake and Tsho 
Rolpa glacial lakes are expanding about 41m and 66m per year respectively which is the rate of 
glacier  retreat  of  respective  glaciers.  Clear  expansion  of  Imja  Lake  can  be  seen  on  different 
satellite images from 1962 to 2006 (Figure 6).   
 
Between 1970 and 2000 during this 30 years period the loss of glacier area was by 5.88% or 0.2% 
per year in the Tamor River basin of Nepal (Bajracharya et al. 2006). Out of the 2323 inventoried 
lakes  330  lakes  are  having  the  area  larger  than  0.02  square  kilometer  and  associated  with  the 
glaciers. Among them 65 lakes including 15 new lakes are growing in size due to glacier retreat 
(Bajracharya et al. 2005). 
 
GLOF in Himalaya  
ICIMOD with its partner institutes mapped about 15,000 glaciers, 9000 lakes and 200 potentially 
dangerous glacial lakes including 21 GLOF events in the Himalayan region except Arunanchal 
and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) region. The database of glaciers, glacial lakes, and glacial 
lake outburst flood in HKH region serves as the baseline data and information for climate change 
study,  planning  for  water  resource  development,  to  understand  and  mitigate  GLOF  associated 
hazards, thus linking science to policy. However with the view of catastrophic events of GLOF in 
the  past  monitoring,  mitigation  and  awareness  of  potential  GLOF  in  the  region  is  necessary  to 
reduce the GLOF hazard. 
Most  of  the  glacial lakes  in the  Himalayan  region  are  known to  have  formed  within  the  last  5 
decades, and a number of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) events have been reported in this 
region  (Table  1).  At  least  between  3  to  10  years  one  GLOF  event  was  recorded  in  Himalayan 
region.  These  GLOF  events  have  resulted  in  loss  of  many  lives,  as  well  as  the  destruction  of 
houses, bridges, fields, forests and roads. The hazardous lakes, however, are situated in remote 
areas. If the potential GLOF could be known in advance, the GLOF hazard could be reduced by 
saving life and properties of local communities. 
Past GLOF events have shown  transboundary damaging effects downstream which are shown in 
the Table 1. The GLOF occured in Tibet/China and damage occurred in Tibet as well as in Nepal 
(Figure 8). GLOFs exacerbate land degradation, increase  variations in the hydrological regime, 

degrade  biodiversity,  and  trigger  many  socioeconomic  externalities.  Climate  change  will  thus 
intensify and accelerate these impacts and further burden the human and natural systems over a 
wide area, far beyond the mountain ecosystem.

Inventory of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Himalaya 
The  International  Centre  for  Integrated  Mountain  Development  (ICIMOD)  and  its  partner 
Institutes,  in  collaboration  with  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  /Regional  Resource 
Centre for Asia and the Pacific (UNEP/RRC-AP) carried out a systematic inventory of glaciers 
and  glacial  lakes  of  Nepal  and  Bhutan  in  19992001.  Later,  the  study  was  continued  in 
collaboration with the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) and the global 
change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START), and expanded to all the ten sub-
basins of the Indus River in Pakistan, all sub-basins of the Ganges River in the Tibet Autonomous 
Region of the Peoples Republic of China, and Tista River Basin along with Himachal Pradesh 
Himalaya  and  Uttaranchal  Himalaya  of  India  (Table  2  and  Figure  7).  Once  the  study  on 
Arunanchal Pradesh and Ajad Jammu & Kashmir Himalayas and northern Afghanistan area are 
completed,  the  entire  database  of  glaciers  and  glacial  lakes  of  the  Hindu  KushHimalaya  will 
serve at the scale of 1:50,000.  
 
The main objective of the study is to link priority topics in the research framework by identifying 
the formation of dangerous glacial lakes in the region as a result of global climate change, with 
direct impacts on terrestrial change and human vulnerability and adaptation.

Conclusions 
The northern hemisphere experienced many warm years after 1990 since climate statistics have 
been monitored and documentation began in 1861 and also expected increase in the global mean 
temperatures  in  coming  years.  The  amount  could  be  anything  from  1.4  to  5.8C  in  2100 
depending on the climate model and greenhouse gases emission scenario. Evidences have been 
conclusive enough to make glacier melting and an important indicator of climate change. During 
the  last  30  years  there  has  been  a  5.5  %  shrinkage  in  volume  of  glaciers  in  China  and  similar 
results  are  also  shown  in  Nepal,  India  and  Bhutan.  The  valley  glaciers  and  small  glaciers  are 
retreating  faster  with  the  formation  and  expansion  of  glacial  lakes.  Most  of  the  glacial  lakes, 
which  are  known  to  have  formed  within  the  last  5  decades.  Subsequently  GLOF  events  are 

recorded  in  the  region  at  least  one  between  3  to  10  years.  These  GLOF  events  have  trans-
boundary effect resulting loss of many lives, as well as the destruction of houses, bridges, fields, 
forests, hydro-powers, roads, etc. Regular monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes and adaptation 
measures including early warning systems and mitigation measure are required in potential GLOF 
area. Important to link this scientific knowledge of potential GLOF hazards to policy, planning 
and community to reduce the GLOF risk.
