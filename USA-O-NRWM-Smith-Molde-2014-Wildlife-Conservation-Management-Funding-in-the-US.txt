EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The authors present a novel approach to help answer the question "Who really 
pays for wildlife in the U.S?" Using public information about budgets of various 
conservation, wildlife advocacy, and land management agencies and non-profit 
organizations, published studies and educated assumptions regarding sources of 
Pittman-Robertson Act and Dingle-Johnson Act federal excise monies from the 
sale  of  sporting  equipment, the  authors  contend  that  approximately  95%  of 
federal, 88% of non-profit, and 94% of total funding for wildlife conservation and 
management come from the non-hunting public. The authors further contend that 
a proper understanding and accurate public perception of this funding question is 
a necessary next step in furthering the current debate as to whether and how 
much influence the general public should have at the wildlife policy-making level, 
particularly within state wildlife agencies.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
With increased awareness and interest of the general (non consumptive) public 
in  controversial  wildlife  management  issues  such  as  fur  trapping,  predator 
control, trophy hunting, coyote killing contests and wolf reintroduction, a debate is 
before us as to whether the general public is or should be afforded a proper voice 
in  wildlife  management  decisions.  Sportsmen  favor  the  current  system,  which 
places  a  heavy  emphasis  on  their  interests  through  favorable  composition  of 
wildlife commissions and a continued emphasis on ungulate management. Non-
human  predators  (wolves,  mountain  lions,  coyotes,  ravens  and  others)  are 
disfavored by wildlife managers at all levels as competition for sportsmen and are 
treated as second-class citizens of the animal kingdom.  Sportsmen suggest this 
bias is justified because Sportsmen pay for wildlife, a refrain heard repeatedly 
when  these  matters  are  discussed.    Agency  personnel  and  policy  foster  this 
belief as well.   

Do sportsmen really pay for wildlife? Is it a fact or an unfounded assertion 
or  something  in  between?  Are  there  ways  of  looking  at  financial  and  other 
information to test the merit of this claim? While wildlife is unequivocally a public

asset  under  the  Public  Trust  Doctrine  (see,  for  example,  SCOUS  1842  and 
Horner 2000), a better understand and definition of how wildlife management is 
financed in this country, particularly the portion attributable to the general public, 
would be of considerable help in deciding whether the general publics interest is 
adequately represented in our current wildlife management system. 
 
Summary of Findings 
While this question is not easy to answer and the information may be murky, we 
have  devised  a  novel  approach,  using  available  public  information  and  certain 
helpful  assumptions  to  offer  a  perspective  on  this  question,  which,  to  our 
knowledge, has not been previously presented.  The results are expressed both 
in  terms  of  annual  budgets  by  organization  (Table  1)  and  acreages  under 
management (Table 2). In summary, approximately 95% of federal, 88% of non-
profit, and 94% of total funding for wildlife conservation and management come 
from the non-hunting public. This runs counter to the common position promoted 
by  many  hunter-centric  organizations  and  even  to  what  state  wildlife  agencies 
often cite (e.g. Mayer, 2012). Another example of this is a motto of the Rocky 
Mountain Elko Foundation: Hunting is Conservation. Obviously hunting per se is 
not  conservation,  but  they  claim  that  hunting  funds  conservation,  nearly 
exclusively.  

The data in Table 1 shows that the financial contribution from hunters is a 
small portion of the total. Of the 8 largest federally funded wildlife programs listed 
in the top half of Table 1, a total of $18.7 billion is spent annually on wildlife, land 
management and related programs (including hunter education). Approximately 
5.3% of the combined operating budgets (top half of Table 1) and 4.9% of the 
land acquisition costs (Table 2) are funded by hunters or through hunting-related 
activities.  The  10  largest  non-profit  conservation  organizations  contribute  $2.5 
billion  annually  to  habitat  and  wildlife  conservation;  of  this,  12.3%  comes  from 
hunters and 87.7% from the non-hunting public (bottom half of Table 1).  
 
Methodology 
In Tables 1 & 2 values have been assigned for the portion of funding derived 
from  hunters  or  hunting-related  activities.  The  difference  between  hunter  and 
hunting  related  as  well  as  the  allocation  of  Pittman-Robertson  and  Dingell-
Johnston  Act  funds  are  discussed  in  the  section  entitled  Pittman-Robertson  & 
Dingell-Johnson  Acts.  The  allocations  for  the  other  items  are  discussed  in  the 
sections entitled General Tax Revenue and Duck Stamp Act. 

State funding was not considered in this study, in part because most state 
wildlife  agency  funding  flows  from  the  federal  government  (about  70%  in 
Nevadas case), and in part because it would be a task larger than our resources 
allowed. It is also generally true that the state funding (e.g. hunter license and tag

sales)  is  rarely  adequate  to  cover  the  direct  costs  of  administering  the  related 
programs; therefore, state-level funding can reasonably be classified as hunting 
or sportsmen services rather than wildlife management. State-owned public lands 
are considered in terms of the acreage under management in Table 2. Also not 
considered  is  the  portion  that  each  agency  or  organization  actually  spends  on 
conservation  versus  other  activities.  For  example,  most  state  wildlife  agencies 
spent  only  a  small  portion  of  their  total  funding  on  conservation.  Other 
organizations, such as the government funded National Wildlife Refuge System 
and  the  donor  funded  Nature  Conservancy,  spend  the  great  majority  of  their 
funding on conservation. This differential was ignored in our analysis.

In our analyses we included those agencies and organizations commonly 
considered by the public to have as their focus habitat and wildlife management

or  conservation  (e.g.  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior  Fish  &  Wildlife  Service 
(FWS),  National  Wildlife  Refuge  System,  Nature  Conservancy,  Audubon).  We 
also included agencies and organizations whose primary purpose is to conserve 
or  manage  the  lands  that  host  wildlife  (the  U.S.  Forest  Service  (USFS),  U.S. 
Bureau of Land Management (US BLM), the state equivalents, the various land 
trusts).  The organizations that manage habitat, such as the US BLM and the 
many private land trusts, are included herein because wildlife requires habitat.  
The  goals  of  these  organizations  include  various  combinations  of  habitat 
management and conservation, biological diversity (necessary to ensure robust 
populations),  food  and  water  supply,  watershed  protection,  migration  corridor 
management, and other issues critical to wildlife conservation and management.   
A potentially controversial choice was to include the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture  Wildlife  Services.  Their  core  function  is  to  control  native  carnivores 
such as wolves, bears, and coyotes, ostensibly to protect agriculture and improve 
hunter  opportunity  (Bruskotter,  2011).  Arguably  they  accomplish  neither  since 
most  livestock  mortality  is  due  to  weather,  birthing,  and  disease,  while  most 
wildlife  mortality  is  due  to  lack  of  food,  impacts  to  habitat,  and  disease.  While 
predator control is wildlife management it is not conservation. Nevertheless, we 
have included their budget in our funding analyses.

SOURCES OF FUNDING & ALLOCATIONS 
The sources of our funding and land acreage figures were, in most cases, the 
official  websites  for  the  named  agencies  or  organizations.  The  total  acreage 
under  management  by  land  trusts  was  obtained  from  the  Land  Trust  Alliance 
(http://www.landtrustalliance.org).  Pittman-Robertson  Act  and  Dingell-Johnston 
Act revenue were obtained from the most recently published federal budgets for 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and US Fish and 
Wildlife  Services 
for  collecting  and 
administering  these  funds,  respectively.  See  the  section  entitled  Pittman-
Robertson  and  Dingell-Johnston  Acts  for  a  detailed  discussion  of  how  those 
revenues were allocated, as well as a brief discussion of the two Acts. 
 
General Tax Revenue 
Most of the federal programs relevant to wildlife management and conservation 
are  funded  from  general  tax  revenue  such  as  personal  and  corporate  income 
taxes. The key exceptions to this are the tax transfers made to the states under 
three  well  known  acts  (and  their  amendments):  the  Federal  Aid  in  Wildlife 
Restoration Act of 1937 (more commonly known as the Pittman-Robertson Act or 
PRA),  the  Federal  Aid  in  Sport  Fish  Restoration  Act  (Dingell-Johnston  Act  or 
DJA), and the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act (Duck Stamp Act). Each of these 
acts is discussed in more detail in subsequent sections. 

Rather than attempt an allocation of general tax revenue funding to hunter 
funding  and  non-hunting  public  funding  by  some  complex  analysis  of 
demographics, we chose the simpler, and possibly equally accurate, method of 
allocation based on the percent of the population who hunts. According to the US 
FWS (2013), there were 14,631,327 hunting licenses issued by all US states in 
2013,  down  from  14,960,522  in  2012.  There  are  two  important  bias  in  these 
statistics: hunters who purchased licenses in more than one state are counted for 
each  state;  and  most  states  exempt  youth  from  license  requirements  (e.g. 
Nevada  hunters  under  the  age  of  12  years  are  not  required  to  purchase  a 
license, in some states the age is 16). We could not find any published analyses 
on either, so we have made no change to the data published by the FWS. It is 
likely that both figures are small and each acts to reduce the effect of the other.   
According  to  the  US  Census  Bureau  (2013),  the  US  population  in  July 
2013 was 316,128,839. Dividing that into the number of hunting licenses sold in 
2013 suggests that 4.6% of the population, and therefore the same percentage of 
general tax revenue is paid by hunters.  That figure has been used in Tables 1 & 
2.  An important side note is that while the US population increases annually, the 
number of hunting licenses sold is on the decline.

Duck Stamp Act 
Funding  of  wildlife  land  gets  a  lot  of  attention  among  sportsmen  and  other 
outdoor enthusiasts. One of the most common to come up in discussion is the 
Duck Stamp program and the land that it has successful protected as refuges 
under  the  National  Wildlife  Refuge  System.  The  federal  government  estimates 
that 1.9% of the 150,000,000 acres (or 2,850,000 acres) of land managed under 
this program was acquired with funds from programs including duck stamp sales 
(USFW, 2014; Lin, 2014). It has been estimated that collectors purchase 10% of 
duck stamps. Duck stamps allow free access to refuges that otherwise charge an 
entrance  fee,  and  an  unknown  portion  of  the  public  purchases  them  for  this 
purpose.  To  determine  the  total  hunter-sourced  portion  of  the  National  Wildlife 
Refuge System acreage, we combined 90% of the 1.9% with the hunter portion of 
general tax revenue (4.6%).  

Considering  the  four  main  federal  agencies,  the  combined  state-owned 
lands, and the collective non profits falling in the category of land trusts, there are 
1.038 billion acres of wildlife habitat under conservation management, of which 
about 4.9% were funded by hunter and 95.1% funded by the non-hunting public. 

 

Pittman-Robertson & Dingell-Johnson Acts 
The  process  of  determining  the  portion  of  the  Pittman-Robertson  Act  (PRA)  & 
Dingell-Johnson Act (DJA) excise taxes generated by hunting-related activities is 
both  complex  and  imprecise.  In  the  end,  any  such  analysis  can  only  be  an 
estimate, since the revenue is not tracked in sufficient detail to allow a precise 
allocation. Our approach was to both recognize and minimize the biases created 
by our assumptions in these analyses. The approach taken in this study is briefly 
summarized here.   

  Beginning  in  1919,  there  has  been  an  excise  tax  on  firearms  and 
ammunition  (10  to  11%  of  the  wholesale  price).  This  tax  was  originally 
administered under the US Treasury, and the income went into the general fund. 
In 1937, the Pittman-Robertson Act transferred this tax to administration by the 
FWS for the exclusive purposes of wildlife management, hunting management, 
and  hunter  education.  The  Dingell-Johnston  Act  (1950),  as  amended  by  the 
Wallop and Breaux Act (1984), extended the excise tax to archery equipment, 
fishing supplies, recreational boat import duties, and marine fuel sales. PRA and 
DJA  funding  totaled  $522  million  and  $360  million,  respectively,  for  the  2013 
fiscal year. 

Our analyses consider funding allocations in two portions: the first based on 
activity (hunting related versus non-hunting related), and the second on general 
population  (hunters  versus  the  non-hunting  public).  This  section  discusses  the 
former; the latter uses the same allocation as for the other categories. We used 
this split approach for the PRA and DJA funds because firearms, ammunition, 
and  archery  equipment  are  purchased  by  both  hunters  and  non-hunters  and

Wildlife Conservation & Management Funding in the U.S.                       Smith & Molde, Oct. 2014 

these are used for both hunting and non-hunting purposes. Therefore, putting the 
total  revenue  into  either  the  hunter  or  non-hunting  public  categories  would 
have created a strong bias. 

The next step was to consider the nature of the purchases that generate the 
excise taxes collected. According to the ATF (Hogue, 2013), the PRA revenue is 
generated in the following proportions:  

o  31% from handgun (pistols and revolvers) production 
o  37% from long guns (rifles and shotguns) production 
o  31% from ammunition production 
o  1% from archery equipment production 
Dingell-Johnston  Act  revenue  is  generated  in  the  following  proportions, 

according to US DF&W statistics (Michigan):  

o  54% from motorboat fuel  
o  15% from small engine fuel 
o  16% from fishing equipment, tackle, trolling motors 
o  9% from interest on trust fund deposits 
o  6% from import duties on boats 
Of  these  funds,  we  next  made  an  estimate  of  the  portion  of  the  revenue 
generated from hunting.  We used a variety of sources of information to produce 
these estimates, principally the following. 

From ATF statistics on sales of firearms by type (ATF, 2011), we identified 
those  types  of  firearms  that  are  used  principally  for  hunting.  We  used  the 
following  allocations:  traditional  rifles  and  shotgun  sales  were  allocated  to 
hunting;  modern  sporting  rifles  (including  tactical  shotguns)  were  allocated 
principally  (but  not  exclusively)  to  non-hunting.  The  results  was  a  combined 
allocation of 40% of long guns to hunting. Handgun sales were allocated 5% to 
hunting based on anecdotal evidence.  

Statistics for ammunition sales published by industry sources (LuckyGunner, 
2012  &  2013;  Bushmann,  2014)  were  used  to  determine  the  approximate 
percentage of sales by caliber. Each caliber was then assigned to one of three 
categories:  principally  hunting,  principally  non-hunting,  or  split.  Examples  of 
ammunition classified herein as principally for hunting include .243 Winchester, 
.30-06  Springfield  and  .308  Winchester  (traditional  deer  and  elk  calibers). 
Principally  non-hunting  ammunition  include  .380  acp,  9  mm  parabellum  (aka 
9mm Luger), .45 acp, .338 Lapua and .50 BMG. Calibers considered to be used 
for  both  hunting  and  non-hunting  include  shotgun  shells  in  all  gauges,  .223 
Remington, 5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm, and large bore magnum handgun calibers 
such as .44 Remington Magnum and .500 S&W Magnum. Based on the relative 
sales statistics, considerably less than 20% of ammunition sales appear to be 
hunting related, but 20% was used in our analysis; this higher figure was used 
because  2013  represented  an  anomaly  in  sales  statistics,  with  sales  more

heavily  weighted  towards  self-defense  and  tactical  than  a  multi-year  average 
would suggest. 

Of the DJA revenue, the only category related to hunting is small engine fuel 
sales, some of which is likely used for waterfowl hunting. Our research did not 
find  any  data  on  allocation  of  these  sales;  we  assumed  15%  is  derived  from 
hunting-related activities.  

Table 3 summarizes the allocations and presents the estimated total funding 
generated by hunting-related activities. The estimate of 14.5% is consistent with 
the  results  published  by  other  authors,  a  commonly  cited  range  being  14%  to 
22%  of  the  DJA  funds  alone  (Lin,  2014),  which  equates  to  8%  to  13%  of  the 
combined PRA and DJA funds.

Another  way  to  estimate  the  portion  of  PRA  funds  generated  by  hunting 
activity  is  to  compare  the  number  of  guns  used  for  hunting  with  total  gun 
ownership.  There  are  an  estimated  270  to  310  million  firearms  in  America 
(Krouse, 2012; GunPolicy; Crime Prevention Research Center, 2014). There are 
14.6  million  licensed  hunters  (FWS,  2013),  though  the  number  of  licensed 
hunters  who  actually  hunt  is  unknown.  If  we  make  an  assumption  that  the 
average hunter owns 3 guns for hunting (e.g. two rifles and a shotgun), then 43.8 
million  guns  are  used  for  hunting,  or  14.1  to  16.2%  of  the  total.  This  would 
suggest  that  8.8  to  10.1%  of  the  combined  PRA  and  DJA  funds  are  hunting-
sourced.  If  we  increase  the  per-hunter  ownership  assumption  to  5  guns,  the

portion  of  combined  funding  increase  to  14.8  to  16.9%.  Both  ranges  compare 
well with the 14.5% figure cited in Table 3. 
 
Possible Biases In Our Analyses of PRA & DJA Revenue 
A large portion of the PRA funds are set aside by law for hunter-specific uses 
rather  than  conservation  or  wildlife  management.  For  example  one  half  of  the 
taxes generated from handguns and archery equipment are set aside exclusively 
for hunter education, which is principally about firearms safety (i.e., Hunter Ed); 
this totaled 15.9% of the PRA revenue in fiscal 2013. While one may reasonably 
argue  that  this  money  is  not  wildlife  conservation  funding,  we  have  elected  to 
ignore  this  issue.  This  creates  a  small  bias  in  favor  of  the  hunter-funding 
category.   

Fiscal  2013  was  a  record-setting  year  for  firearm  and  ammunition  sales, 
based on worries in the gun community about new federal gun control legislation 
following the Sandy Hook shootings and the reelection of President Obama. This 
increased  the  PRA  funding,  both  in  terms  of  the  total  dollars  and  the  PRA 
percentage of the combined PRA and DJA revenues. This, in turn, increased the 
apparent hunting allocation over a multi-year average. At the same time the types 
of guns and ammunition which saw the greatest sales increases in 2013 were not 
traditional hunting equipment but rather modern sporting riflesa or MSRs), tactical 
shotguns,  tactical  and  self  defense  ammunition.  For  example,  9mm  handgun 
ammunition sales increased to 21.4% of the total in 2013 from 14.2% in 2012 
(LuckyGunner,  2012  &  2013).  According  to  the  National  Shooting  Sports 
Foundation  survey,  82%  of  recent  purchases  were  AR-platform  rifles  (NSSF, 
2013). The disproportionate increase in sales of pistols, tactical long guns, and 
the  related  ammunition  decreased  the  apparent  hunting  contribution.  The  net 
affect was not estimated. 

  We applied 40% of long gun sales in 2013 to hunting sales, though the 
statistics suggest that this number should be lower. If, for example, the above 
NSSF quote is accurate and 82% of recent sales were AR platforms, and if AR 
platforms  are  principally  not  used  for  hunting  as  other  surveys  and  anecdotal 
evidence suggest, the actual percentage allocated to hunting could be overstated 
by 10 percentage points or more.

Wildlife Conservation & Management Funding in the U.S.                       Smith & Molde, Oct. 2014 

CLOSING COMMENTS 
Gill (1996) concluded that the narrowly based funding of state wildlife agencies 
has blurred the essential distinction between public interest and special interest 
and inevitably eroded both scientific credibility and public trust.  We would argue 
that  it  is  the  perception  not  the  reality  that  has  blurred  the  distinction.  For 
example, then director of the Nevada Department of Wildlife Ken Mayer wrote to 
the  legislative  sunset  subcommittee  ...the  contribution  to  NDOWs  operating 
budgets from sportsmen is 79 percent of total funding (Mayer, 2012). He was 
assuming that all of the federal excise tax transfers were hunter-sourced. This is 
a misrepresentation often used to manipulate public opinion and influence policy. 
This narrative ...logically encourages those who pay via licenses and permits for 
the privilege of using wildlife to expect greater benefits...Because [its believed 
that] hunters pay the bills, it is not surprising that they are given much attention 
and wield a great deal of influence... (Jacobson et al, 2010).  

Modern wildlife management has wandered far from the original path of the 
Public Trust Doctrine and the North American Wildlife Conservation Model from 
which it flows (SCOUS, 1842; Horner, 2000). Smith (1980) identified three criteria 
that need to be met for the Public Trust Doctrine to be effective:  

1.  The general public must be aware of their legal standing with respect to 

public ownership of wildlife;  

2.  This  standing  and  the  rights  associated  with  it  must  be  enforceable 

against the government so that the public can hold it accountable; and, 

3.  Interpretation  of 

these  rights  must  be  adaptable 
concerns, such as biodiversity and species extinction.    

to  contemporary 

All three are impaired when the basis of public debate is a myth.  Its time that 
we call for honest dialog from our state and federal agencies and transparency in 
wildlife policy making.
