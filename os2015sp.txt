Text: Operating System Concepts (8/e), by A. Silberschatz, G. Gagne and P.B. Galvin, Addison-Wesley, 2008. 
 
Course Content: Introduction to operating systems concepts. Topics may include multiprogramming, resources 
allocation and management, and their implementation. Research project and research paper. 
 
Prerequisite: CSC 3320 System-Level Programming with grade of C or higher. Topics include editors, systems 
calls, programming  tools,  files,  processes, interprocess  communication,  and  shells.  If  a  student  didnt  take the 
prerequisite course, the student would not be allowed to take CSc 4320 (or 6320). 
 
Course  Requirements:  All  students  learn  basic  theoretical  principles  and  accumulate  practical  hands-on 
experience.  All  students  will  do  assignments,  take  tests  and  finish  programming  projects.  At  the  end  of  this 
semester, all graduate students and undergraduate students will give presentations to share knowledge and skills. 
An  undergraduate  student  needs  to  write  a  technical  paper  with  IEEE  format  (3  or  more  pages).  A  graduate 
student needs to write a conference paper with IEEE format (4 or more pages).  
 
Class Policy: 
Attendance: Students are required to attend all classes. Role will be taken.  
Class Web  Site:  class information such  as  class  cancellation  and  schedule change  will  be  announced in  class 
and  posted  on  the  class  Web  site.  Syllabus,  Assignments, Test  Reviews,  Project  Schedule,  Lecture  Notes, 
Text Book Web Site are also posted on the class Web site.    

Academic honesty: Plagiarism will result in a score of zero on any test, assignment or paper. The instructor has 

the right to evaluate if students are cheating and make a decision.  

Assignments and Projects: Hardcopies of assignments and project reports must be handed in to me in class on 
time and will not be accepted when past due time (i.e., class time on the due day). Email submissions are 
not  allowed.  Solutions  of  assignments  and  tests  are  discussed  in  class,  so  students  are  responsible  to  get 
graded assignments (students may keep them), know solutions, and review tests. 
Withdrawal: March 3 Tuesday is the last day to withdraw and possibly receive a W. 
Make-ups: Must need the instructor's special permission. In most cases, they are not allowed. 
 
Grading Policy:  

Mid-term Exam 20% 
Final Exam 20% 
Assignments 15% 
Projects 40% 
Attendance 5%
