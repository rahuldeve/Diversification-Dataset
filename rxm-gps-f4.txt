         Warning: Some customers may want Linx radio frequency (RF) 
products to control machinery or devices remotely, including machinery 
or devices that can cause death, bodily injuries, and/or property 
damage if improperly or inadvertently triggered, particularly in industrial 
settings or other applications implicating life-safety concerns (Life and 
Property Safety Situations).  

NO OEM LINX REMOTE CONTROL OR FUNCTION MODULE 
SHOULD EVER BE USED IN LIFE AND PROPERTY SAFETY 
SITUATIONS.  No OEM Linx Remote Control or Function Module 
should be modified for Life and Property Safety Situations.  Such 
modification cannot provide sufficient safety and will void the products 
regulatory certification and warranty.

Customers may use our (non-Function) Modules, Antenna and 
Connectors as part of other systems in Life Safety Situations, but 
only with necessary and industry appropriate redundancies and 
in compliance with applicable safety standards, including without 
limitation, ANSI and NFPA standards.  It is solely the responsibility 
of any Linx customer who uses one or more of these products to 
incorporate appropriate redundancies and safety standards for the Life 
and Property Safety Situation application.

Do not use this or any Linx product to trigger an action directly 
from the data line or RSSI lines without a protocol or encoder/
decoder to validate the data. Without validation, any signal from 
another unrelated transmitter in the environment received by the module 
could inadvertently trigger the action.

All RF products are susceptible to RF interference that can prevent 
communication. RF products without frequency agility or hopping 
implemented are more subject to interference. This module does not 
have a frequency hopping protocol built in.

Do not use any Linx product over the limits in this data guide. 
Excessive voltage or extended operation at the maximum voltage could 
cause product failure. Exceeding the reflow temperature profile could 
cause product failure which is not immediately evident.

Do not make any physical or electrical modifications to any Linx 
product. This will void the warranty and regulatory and UL certifications 
and may cause product failure which is not immediately evident.

Description
The F4 Series GPS receiver module is a 
self-contained high-performance GPS 
receiver. Based on the SiRFstar IV chipset, 
it provides exceptional sensitivity, even 
in dense foliage and urban canyons. The 
modules very low power consumption 
helps maximize runtimes in battery powered 
applications. The F4 Series receiver can 
acquire and track up to 48 satellites 
simultaneously in just seconds, even at the 
lowest signal levels. Housed in a compact 
reflow-compatible SMD package, the receiver requires no programming or 
additional RF components (except an antenna) to form a complete GPS 
solution. Five GPIOs are easily configured through simple serial commands. 
These features along with the modules standard NMEA data output make 
the F4 Series easy to integrate, even by engineers without previous RF or 
GPS experience.

A Brief Overview of GPS
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a U.S.-owned utility that freely and 
continuously provides positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information. 
Originally created by the U.S. Department of Defense for military 
applications, the system was made available without charge to civilians 
in the early 1980s. The global positioning system consists of a nominal 
constellation of 24 satellites orbiting the earth at about 12,000 nautical 
miles in height. The pattern and spacing of the satellites allow at least four 
to be visible above the horizon from any point on the Earth. Each satellite 
transmits low power radio signals which contain three different bits of 
information; a pseudorandom code identifying the satellite, ephemeris data 
which contains the current date and time as well as the satellites health, 
and the almanac data which tells where each satellite should be at any time 
throughout the day. 

A GPS receiver receives and times the signals sent by multiple satellites 
and calculates the distance to each satellite. If the position of each satellite 
is known, the receiver can use triangulation to determine its position 
anywhere on the earth. The receiver uses four satellites to solve for four 
unknowns; latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. If any of these factors is 
already known to the system, an accurate position (fix) can be obtained 
with fewer satellites in view. Tracking more satellites improves calculation 
accuracy. In essence, the GPS system provides a unique address for every 
square meter on the planet. 

A faster Time To First Fix (TTFF) is also possible if the satellite information 
is already stored in the receiver. If the receiver knows some of this 
information, then it can accurately predict its position before acquiring an 
updated position fix. For example, aircraft or marine navigation equipment 
may have other means of determining altitude, so the GPS receiver would 
only have to lock on to three satellites and calculate three equations to 
provide the first position fix after power-up.

Client Generated Extended Ephemeris (CGEE)
CGEE is a type of assisted GPS (AGPS) where the receiver uses the 
ephemeris data broadcast by the satellites to calculate models of each 
visible satellites future location. This allows the receiver to store up to 3 
days worth of ephemeris data and results in faster TTFF.

5

Time To First Fix (TTFF)
TTFF is often broken down into three parts:

Cold: A cold start is when the receiver has no accurate knowledge of its 
position or time. This happens when the receivers internal Real Time Clock 
(RTC) has not been running or it has no valid ephemeris or almanac data. 
In a cold start, the receiver takes 35 to 40 seconds to acquire its position. 

Warm or Normal: A typical warm start is when the receiver has valid 
almanac and time data and has not significantly moved since its last valid 
position calculation. This happens when the receiver has been shut down 
for more than 2 hours, but still has its last position, time, and almanac 
saved in memory, and its RTC has been running. The receiver can predict 
the location of the current visible satellites and its location; however, it 
needs to wait for an ephemeris broadcast (every 30 seconds) before it can 
accurately calculate its position.

Hot or Standby: A hot start is when the receiver has valid ephemeris, time, 
and almanac data. This happens when the receiver has been shut down 
for less than 2 hours and has the necessary data stored in memory with 
the RTC running. In a hot start, the receiver takes 1 second to acquire its 
position. The time to calculate a fix in this state is sometimes referred to as 
Time to Subsequent Fix or TTSF.

Module Description
The F4 Series GPS Receiver module is based on the SiRFstarIV chipset, 
which consumes less power than competitive products while providing 
exceptional performance even in dense foliage and urban canyons. No 
external RF components are needed other than an antenna. The simple 
serial interface and industry standard NMEA protocol make integration of 
the F4 Series receiver into an end product extremely straightforward.

The modules high-performance RF architecture allows it to receive GPS 
signals that are as low as 160dBm. The F4 Series can track up to 48 
satellites at the same time. Once locked onto the visible satellites, the 
receiver calculates the range to the satellites and determines its position 
and the precise time. It then outputs the data through a standard serial port 
using several standard NMEA protocol formats.

The GPS core handles all of the necessary initialization, tracking, and 
calculations autonomously, so no programming is required. The RF section 
is optimized for low level signals, and requires no production tuning.

Power Supply Requirements
The module requires a clean, well-regulated power source. While it is 
preferable to power the unit from a battery, it can operate from a power 
supply as long as noise is less than 20mV. Power supply noise can 
significantly affect the receivers sensitivity, therefore providing clean power 
to the module should be a high priority during design. Bypass capacitors 
should be placed as close as possible to the module. The values should be 
adjusted depending on the amount and type of noise present on the supply 
line.

The 1PPS Output
The 1PPS line outputs 1 pulse per second on the rising edge of the GPS 
second when the receiver has an over-solved navigation solution from 
five or more satellites. The pulse has a duration of 200ms with the rising 
edge on the GPS second. This line is low until the receiver acquires an 
over-solved navigation solution (a lock on more than 4 satellites). The 
GPS second is based on the atomic clocks in the GPS satellites, which 
are monitored and set to Universal Time master clocks. This output and 
the time calculated from the GPS satellite transmissions can be used as a 
clock feature in an end product.

Antenna Considerations
The F4 Series module is designed to utilize a wide variety of external 
antennas, but care must be taken in antenna selection to ensure optimum 
performance. For example, a handheld device may be used in many 
varying orientations so an antenna element with a wide and uniform 
pattern may yield better overall performance than an antenna element with 
high gain and a correspondingly narrower beam. Conversely, an antenna 
mounted in a fixed and predictable manner may benefit from pattern and 
gain characteristics suited to that application. Evaluating multiple antenna 
solutions in real-world situations is a good way to rapidly assess which will 
best meet the needs of your application.

For GPS, the antenna should have good right hand circular polarization 
characteristics (RHCP) to match the polarization of the GPS signals. 
Ceramic patches are the most commonly used style of antenna, but 
there are many different shapes, sizes and styles of antennas available. 
Regardless of the construction, they will generally be either passive or 
active types. Passive antennas are simply an antenna tuned to the correct 
frequency. Active antennas add a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) after the 
antenna and before the module to amplify the weak GPS satellite signals. 

For active antennas, a 300 ohm ferrite bead can be used to connect the 
the RFIN line to an external supply for the antenna. This bead prevents the 
RF from getting into the power supply, but allows the DC voltage onto the 
RF trace to feed into the antenna. A series capacitor inside the module 
prevents this DC voltage from affecting the bias on the modules internal 
LNA.

Maintaining a 50 ohm path between the module and antenna is critical. 
Errors in layout can significantly impact the modules performance. Please 
review the layout guidelines elsewhere in this guide carefully to become 
more familiar with these considerations.

Power Control
The F4 Series GPS Receiver module offers four power control modes: 
Full Power, Adaptive Trickle Power, Push-to-Fix and Hibernate. In Full 
Power mode the module is fully active and and continuously tracking. 
Measurements are of the highest quality and are continuously output by the 
module. This is the highest current consumption state.

In Adaptive Trickle Power mode, the receiver powers on at full power to 

acquire and track satellites and obtain satellite data. It then powers off the 
RF stage and only uses its processor (CPU) to determine a position fix. 
Once the fix is obtained, the receiver goes into Hibernate mode. After a 
user-defined period of time, the receiver wakes up to track the satellites for 
a user-defined period of time, updates its position using the CPU only, and 
then resumes standby. The initial acquisition time is variable, depending 
on whether it is a cold start or assisted, but a maximum acquisition time is 
definable. This cycling of power is ideal for battery-powered applications 
since it significantly reduces the amount of power consumed by the 
receiver while still providing similar performance to the full power mode.

Push-to-Fix mode is for applications that require infrequent position 
reporting. The module stays in Hibernate mode until either the ON_OFF 
line is triggered or a user-defined time period has expired. The Push-to-Fix 
Period is set by a serial command and can be between 10 seconds and 
two hours. An edge on the ON-OFF line triggers an immediate position fix. 
When the module wakes up it acquires a new position fix and outputs the 
NMEA messages before going back into Hibernate mode.

Hibernate mode is the lowest power setting. The tracking and processor 
blocks are powered down, but the RTC is still running and the memory 
blocks are still powered, enabling a hot start.

The module switches between these states by toggling the ON_OFF line. 
The ON_OFF line must go high for at least 100ms to trigger the change of 
state and must remain low for at least 100ms to reset the edge detector.

Figure 7: F4 Series GPS Receiver Power Control

If the module is in Full Power mode, a pulse on the ON_OFF line initiates an 
orderly shutdown into Hibernate mode. If the module is in Hibernate mode, 
a pulse transistions the module into Full Power Mode. If the module is in 
Push-to-fix mode a pulse initiates a single push-to-fix cycle. If the module is 
in Adaptive Trickle Power mode, a pulse initiates one Trickle Power cycle.

Module Power-up Sequence
The module requires a specific sequence to power up and begin normal 
operation. When power is first applied the module enters a ready-to-start 
state while the Real Time Clock (RTC) starts up and settles. It awaits a 
pulse on the ON_OFF line to enter Full Power Mode.

The RTC start time is variable, so the host needs to either monitor the 
RFPWRUP line for a high pulse or wait for at least one second before 
pulsing the ON_OFF line. An example flowchart is shown in Figure 8.

Module Power-down Sequence
The module requires a controlled power-down sequence. Uncontrolled 
removal of power while the module is operating carries the risk of data 
corruption. The consequences of this corruption range from longer TTFF 
to complete system failure. The appropriate procedure to remove power is 
shown in Figure 9.

Slow Start Time
The most critical factors in start time are current ephemeris data, signal 
strength and sky view. The ephemeris data describes the path of each 
satellite as they orbit the earth. This is used to calculate the position of 
a satellite at a particular time. This data is only usable for a short period 
of time, so if it has been more than a few hours since the last fix or if the 
location has significantly changed (a few hundred miles), then the receiver 
may need to wait for a new ephemeris transmission before a position can 
be calculated. The GPS satellites transmit the ephemeris data every 30 
seconds. Transmissions with a low signal strength may not be received 
correctly or be corrupted by ambient noise. The view of the sky is important 
because the more satellites the receiver can see, the faster the fix and the 
more accurate the position will be when the fix is obtained.

If the receiver is in a very poor location, such as inside a building, urban 
canyon, or dense foliage, then the time to first fix can be slowed. In very 
poor locations with poor signal strength and a limited view of the sky with 
outdated ephemeris data, this could be on the order of several minutes. 
In the worst cases, the receiver may need to receive almanac data, which 
describes the health and course data for every satellite in the constellation. 
This data is transmitted every 15 minutes. If a lock is taking a long time, try 
to find a location with a better view of the sky and fewer obstructions. Once 
locked, it is easier for the receiver to maintain the position fix.

Protocols
Linx GPS modules use the SiRFstar IV chipset. This chipset allows two
protocols to be used, NMEA-0183 and SiRF Binary. Switching between the 
two is handled using a single serial command. The NMEA protocol uses 
ASCII characters for the input and output messages and provides the most 
common features of GPS development in a small command set. The SiRF 
Binary protocol uses BYTE data types and allows more detailed control 
over the GPS receiver and its functionality using a much larger command 
set. Although both protocols have selectable baud rates, its recommended 
that SiRF Binary use 115,200bps. For a detailed description of the SiRF 
Binary protocol, see the SiRF Binary Protocol Reference Manual, available 
from SiRF Technology, Inc. 

Note: Although SiRF Binary protocol may be used with the module, 
Linx only offers tech support for the NMEA protocol.

Interfacing with NMEA Messages
Linx modules default to the NMEA protocol. Output messages are sent 
from the receiver on the TX pin and input messages are sent to the receiver 
on the RX pin. By default, output messages are sent once every second. 
Details of each message are described in the following sections.

The NMEA message format is as follows: <Message-ID + Data Payload +
Checksum + End Sequence>. The serial data structure defaults to 
9,600bps, 8 data bits, 1 start bit, 2 stop bits, and no parity. Each message 
starts with a $ character and ends with a <CR> <LF>. All fields within 
each message are separated by a comma. The checksum follows the * 
character and is the last two characters, not including the <CR> <LF>. 
It consists of two hex digits representing the exclusive OR (XOR) of all 
characters between, but not including, the $ and * characters. When 
reading NMEA output messages, if a field has no value assigned to it, the 
comma will still be placed following the previous comma. For example, 
{,04,,,,,2.0,} shows four empty fields between values 04 and 2.0. When 
writing NMEA input messages, all fields are required, none are optional. An 
empty field will invalidate the message and it will be ignored.

Reading NMEA output messages:
	 Initialize a serial interface to match the serial data structure of the GPS 

receiver.

	 Read the NMEA data from the TX pin into a receive buffer.

	 Separate it into six buffers, one for each message type. Use the 
characters ($) and <CR> <LF> as end points for each message.

	 For each message, calculate the checksum as mentioned above to 

compare with the received checksum.

	 Parse the data from each message using commas as field separators.

	 Update the application with the parsed field values.

	 Clear the receive buffer and be ready for the next set of messages. 

Writing NMEA input messages:
	 Initialize a serial interface to match the serial data structure of the GPS 

receiver.

	 Assemble the message to be sent with the calculated checksum.

	 Transmit the message to the receiver on the RX pin.

NMEA Output Messages
The following sections outline the data structures of the NMEA messages 
that are supported by the module. By default, the NMEA commands are 
output at 9,600bps, 8 data bits, no parity 1 start bit and 2 stop bits.

Standard for Interfacing Marine Electronic Devices. 
Checksums are required on all input messages.

Each message must be terminated using Carriage 
Return (CR) Line Feed (LF) (\r\n, 0x0D0A) to cause 
the receiver to process the input message. They 
are not printable ASCII characters, so are omitted 
from the examples.

100  SetSerialPort
This command message is used to set the protocol (SiRF binary or NMEA)
and/or the communication parameters (baud rate). Generally, this 
command is used to switch the module back to SiRF binary protocol mode 
where a more extensive command message set is available. When a valid 
message is received, the parameters are stored in battery-backed SRAM 
and the receiver restarts using the saved parameters.

101  NavigationInitialization
This command is used to initialize the receiver with the current position (in 
X, Y, Z coordinates), clock offset, and time, enabling a faster fix. Increased 
receiver sensitivity and the removal of Selective Availability (SA) have made 
this unneccessary. The command is retained for its ability to reset the 
module, but the initialization fields are no longer supported.

103  Update Rate Control
This command is used to control the output of standard NMEA messages 
GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV, RMC and VTG. Using this command message, 
standard NMEA messages may be polled once, or setup for periodic 
output. Checksums may also be enabled or disabled depending on the 
needs of the receiving program. NMEA message settings are saved in 
battery-backed memory for each entry when the message is accepted.

Figure 23 contains the values for the following example:
1.  Query the GGA message with checksum enabled 

$PSRF103,00,01,00,01*25

2.  Enable VTG message for a 1Hz constant output with checksum  

enabled 
$PSRF103,05,00,01,01*20
3.  Disable VTG message 
$PSRF103,05,00,00,01*21

4.  Enable 5Hz mode 
$PSRF103,0,6,0,0*23

5.  Disable 5Hz mode 

$PSRF103,0,7,0,0*22

Note: When using 5Hz mode, it is recommended to disable any 
unused NMEA message types (see example 3) and set the serial port 
to maximum baud rate (see Figure 20). The rate divider takes effect 
only after a fix is established.

Board Layout Guidelines
The modules design makes integration straightforward; however, it 
is still critical to exercise care in PCB layout. Failure to observe good 
layout techniques can result in a significant degradation of the modules 
performance. A primary layout goal is to maintain a characteristic 
50-ohm impedance throughout the path from the antenna to the module. 
Grounding, filtering, decoupling, routing and PCB stack-up are also 
important considerations for any RF design. The following section provides 
some basic design guidelines which may be helpful.

During prototyping, the module should be soldered to a properly laid-out 
circuit board. The use of prototyping or perf boards will result in poor 
performance and is strongly discouraged.

The module should, as much as reasonably possible, be isolated from 
other components on your PCB, especially high-frequency circuitry such as 
crystal oscillators, switching power supplies, and high-speed bus lines.

Each of the modules ground pins should have short traces tying  
immediately to the ground plane through a via.

Bypass caps should be low ESR ceramic types and located directly  
adjacent to the pin they are serving.

A 50-ohm coax should be used for connection to an external antenna.  
A 50-ohm transmission line, such as a microstrip, stripline or coplanar 
waveguide should be used for routing RF on the PCB. The Microstrip  
Details section provides additional information.

In some instances, a designer may wish to encapsulate or pot the 
product. There is a wide variety of potting compounds with varying 
dielectric properties. Since such compounds can considerably impact 
RF performance and the ability to rework or service the product, it is 
the responsibility of the designer to evaluate and qualify the impact and 
suitability of such materials.

When possible, separate RF and digital circuits into different PCB regions. 
Make sure internal wiring is routed away from the module and antenna, and 
is secured to prevent displacement.

Pad Layout
The pad layout diagram in Figure 50 is designed to facilitate both hand and 
automated assembly.

Do not route PCB traces directly under the module. There should not be 
any copper or traces under the module on the same layer as the module, 
just bare PCB. The underside of the module has traces and vias that could 
short or couple to traces on the products circuit board.

The Pad Layout section shows a typical PCB footprint for the module. A 
ground plane (as large and uninterrupted as possible) should be placed on 
a lower layer of your PC board opposite the module. This plane is essential 
for creating a low impedance return for ground and consistent stripline 
performance.

Use care in routing the RF trace between the module and the antenna or
connector. Keep the trace as short as possible. Do not pass under the 
module or any other component. Do not route the antenna trace on 
multiple PCB layers as vias will add inductance. Vias are acceptable for 
tying together ground layers and component grounds and should be used 
in multiples.

Microstrip Details
A transmission line is a medium whereby RF energy is transferred from one
place to another with minimal loss. This is a critical factor, especially in 
high-frequency products like Linx RF modules, because the trace leading 
to the modules antenna can effectively contribute to the length of the 
antenna, changing its resonant bandwidth. In order to minimize loss and 
detuning, some form of transmission line between the antenna and the 
module should be used, unless the antenna can be placed very close 
(<18in) to the module. One common form of transmission line is a coax  
cable; another is the microstrip. This term refers to a PCB trace running 
over a ground plane that is designed to serve as a transmission line 
between the module and the antenna. The width is based on the desired 
characteristic impedance of the line, the thickness of the PCB, and the 
dielectric constant of the board material. For standard 0.062" thick FR-4 
board material, the trace width would be 111 mils. The correct trace width 
can be calculated for other widths and materials using the information  
below. Handy software for calculating microstrip lines is also available on 
the Linx website, www.linxtechnologies.com.

Production Guidelines
The module is housed in a hybrid SMD package that supports hand and 
automated assembly techniques. Since the modules contain discrete 
components internally, the assembly procedures are critical to ensuring 
the reliable function of the modules. The following procedures should be 
reviewed with and practiced by all assembly personnel.

Soldering Iron
Tip

Hand Assembly
Pads located on the bottom 
of the module are the primary 
mounting surface (Figure 53). 
Since these pads are inaccessible 
during mounting, castellations 
that run up the side of the 
module have been provided to 
facilitate solder wicking to the 
modules underside. This allows 
for very quick hand soldering 
for prototyping and small volume production.  If the recommended pad 
guidelines have been followed, the pads will protrude slightly past the 
edge of the module. Use a fine soldering tip to heat the board pad and the 
castellation, then introduce solder to the pad at the modules edge. The 
solder will wick underneath the module, providing reliable attachment. Tack 
one module corner first and then work around the device, taking care not 
to exceed the times in Figure 54.

Automated Assembly
For high-volume assembly, the modules are generally auto-placed. 
The modules have been designed to maintain compatibility with reflow 
processing techniques; however, due to their hybrid nature, certain aspects 
of the assembly process are far more critical than for other component 
types. Following are brief discussions of the three primary areas where 
caution must be observed.

Reflow Temperature Profile
The single most critical stage in the automated assembly process is the 
reflow stage. The reflow profile in Figure 55 should not be exceeded 
because excessive temperatures or transport times during reflow will 
irreparably damage the modules. Assembly personnel need to pay careful 
attention to the ovens profile to ensure that it meets the requirements 
necessary to successfully reflow all components while still remaining 
within the limits mandated by the modules. The figure below shows the 
recommended reflow oven profile for the modules.

Shock During Reflow Transport
Since some internal module components may reflow along with the 
components placed on the board being assembled, it is imperative that 
the modules not be subjected to shock or vibration during the time solder 
is liquid. Should a shock be applied, some internal components could be 
lifted from their pads, causing the module to not function properly.

Washability
The modules are wash-resistant, but are not hermetically sealed. Linx 
recommends wash-free manufacturing; however, the modules can be 
subjected to a wash cycle provided that a drying time is allowed prior 
to applying electrical power to the modules. The drying time should be 
sufficient to allow any moisture that may have migrated into the module 
to evaporate, thus eliminating the potential for shorting damage during 
power-up or testing.  If the wash contains contaminants, the performance 
may be adversely affected, even after drying.
