Avoiding Wildfire Damage: A Checklist for Homeowners
F E D E R A L   E M E R G E N C Y   M A N A G E M E N T   A G E N C Y

If you live in a forest or wildland area, you face the real danger of wildfire. Wildfires destroy thou-
sands of homes and devastate hundreds of thousands of acres of woodland every year.  
Protecting your home from wildfire is your responsibility.  To reduce the risk, youll need to consider
the fire resistance of your home, the topography of your property and the nature of the vegetation
close by.
This homeowners checklist will help learn what you can do.  You should also contact your local fire
department, forestry office, emergency management office or building department for information
about local fire laws, building codes and protection measures.
Always be ready for an emergency evacuation.  Evacuation may be the only way to protect your fam-
ily in a wildfire.  Know where to go and what to bring with you.  You should plan several escape
routes in case roads are blocked by a wildfire.  

Do you know your wildfire
risk?
Learn about the history of wildfire
in your area.  Be aware of recent
weather.  A long period without
rain increases the risk of wildfire.
Consider having a professional
inspect your property and offer
recommendations for reducing the
wildfire risk.

Determine your communitys abil-
ity to respond to wildfire.  Are
roads leading to your property
clearly marked?  Are the roads
wide enough to allow firefighting
equipment to get through?  Is
your house number visible from
the roadside?

Have you thinned out and
maintained the vegetation
around the house?
All vegetation is fuel for a wildfire,
though some trees and shrubs are
more flammable than others.  To
reduce the risk, you will need to
modify or eliminate brush, trees

and other vegetation near your
home.  The greater the distance
between your home and the vege-
tation, the greater the protection.

Create a 30-foot safety zone
around the house.
Keep the volume of vegetation in
this zone to a minimum.  If you
live on a hill, extend the zone on
the downhill side.  Fire spreads
rapidly uphill.  The steeper the
slope, the more open space you
will need to protect your home.

In this zone, do the following:

 Remove vines from the walls of

the house.

 Move shrubs and other land-

scaping away from the sides of
the house.

 Prune branches and shrubs

within 15 feet of chimneys and
stove pipes.

 Remove tree limbs within 15

feet of the ground.

 Thin a 15-foot space between

tree crowns.

 Replace highly flammable vege-

tation such as pine, evergreen,
eucalyptus, junipers and fir trees
with lower growing, less flam-
mable species.  Check with your
local fire department or garden
store for suggestions.

 Replace vegetation that has living
or dead branches from the ground-
level up (these act as ladder fuels
for the approaching fire).

 Cut the lawn often.

 Clear the area of leaves, brush,

dead limbs and fallen trees.

Create a second zone at least
100 feet around the house. 
This zone should begin about 30
feet from the house and extend to
at least 100 feet.  In this zone,
reduce or replace as much of the
most flammable vegetation as 
possible.  If you live on a hill, you
may need to extend the zone for

several hundred feet to provide 
the desired level of safety.

Are combustible materials
away from the house?
Identify all combustible materials
outside the house.  Stack firewood
100 feet away and uphill from the
house.  Keep the gas grill and
propane tank at least 15 feet from
house.  Clear an area 15 feet
around the grill.  Place a 1/4 inch
mesh screen over the grill. 

Are sun decks and porches
enclosed underneath?
Any porch, balcony or overhang
with exposed space underneath is
fuel for an approaching fire.
Overhangs ignite easily by flying
embers and by the heat and fire
that gets trapped underneath.  If
vegetation is allowed to grow
underneath or if the space is used
for storage, the hazard is increased
significantly.
Clear leaves, trash and other com-
bustible materials away from under-
neath sun decks and porches.
Extend 1/2-inch mesh screen from
all overhangs down to the ground.
Enclose wooden stilts with non-
combustible material such as con-
crete, brick, rock, stucco or metal.
Use non-combustible patio furni-
ture and covers.

If youre planning a porch or sun
deck, use non-combustible or fire-
resistant materials.  If possible,
build the structure to the ground so
that there is no space underneath.

Are eaves and overhangs
enclosed?
Like porches and balconies, eaves
trap the heat rising along the exte-
rior siding.  Enclose all eaves to
reduce the hazard.

Are house vents covered with
wire mesh?

Any attic vent, soffit vent, louver
or other opening can allow embers
and flaming debris to enter a
home and ignite it.  Cover all
openings with 1/4 inch or smaller
corrosion-resistant wire mesh.  If
youre designing louvers, place
them in the vertical wall rather
than the soffit of the overhang.

Is the roof made of non-
combustible materials?
The roof is especially vulnerable 
in a wildfire.  Embers and flaming
debris can travel great distances,
land on your roof and start a new
fire.
Avoid flammable roofing materials
such as wood, shake and shingle.
Materials that are more fire resis-
tant include single ply mem-
branes, fiberglass shingles, slate,
metal, clay and concrete tile.
Clear gutters of leaves and debris.

Are chimneys and stovepipes
covered with spark arrestors?
Chimneys create a hazard when
embers escape through the top.
To prevent this, install spark
arrestors on all chimneys,
stovepipes and vents for fuel- 

burning heaters.  Use spark
arrestors made of 12-gauge welded
or woven wire mesh screen with
openings 1/2 inch across.  Ask
your fire department for exact
specifications.

If youre building a chimney, use
non-combustible materials and
make sure the top of the chimney
is at least two feet higher than any
obstruction within 10 feet of the
chimney.

Is the house siding fire 
resistant?
Use fire resistant materials in the
siding of your home, such as stuc-
co, metal, brick, cement shingles,
concrete and rock.  You can treat
wood siding with UL-approved
fire retardant chemicals, but the
treatment and protection are not
permanent.

Have windows been treated 
to reduce the risk?
Windows allow radiated heat to
pass through and ignite com-
bustible materials inside.  The
larger the pane of glass, the more
vulnerable it is to fire.

Dual- or triple-pane thermal glass,
and fire resistant shutters or
drapes, help reduce the wildfire
risk.  You can also install non-
combustible awnings to shield
windows and use shatter-resistant
glazing such as tempered or wire
glass.
