Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Introduction 

 
1. 

 

This  document  provides  advice  under  Regulation  33  (2)  for  the  Severn  Estuary  European  Marine  Site 
(EMS), which comprises the following sites :  
 

  Severn Estuary Special Area of Conservation (SAC)* 
  Severn Estuary Special Protection Area (SPA)  
  Severn Estuary Ramsar Site 

 
(*At the time of issue of this document the Severn Estuary has been accepted by the European Commission 
as a Site of Community Importance (SCI) but formal notices have not yet been issued (expected to take place 
in  2009).    Given  the  imminent  notification  of  the  SAC  the  Severn  Estuary  SCI  is  referred  to  as  SAC 
throughout this document).  

 

 

 

 

The indicative extent and relationship of these designated sites is shown in Appendix 1 
 
This document: 
 

is  designed  to  help  relevant  and  competent  authorities  responsible  for  complying  with  the 
requirements of the Habitats Directive to understand the international importance of the site and the 
underlying physical and ecological processes supporting the habitats and species for which each of 
the above designated sites has been selected.  
is  intended  to  assist  the  relevant  authorities  to  develop,  if  considered  appropriate,  a  management 
scheme  under  Regulation  34  of  the  Habitats  Regulations,  under  which  they  shall  exercise  their 
functions in accordance with the requirements of the Directive; 
contains  Natural  England  and  CCWs  advice  to  competent  authorities  as  to  the  conservation 
objectives of each of the above designated sites, for the purpose of considering plans and projects in 
accordance with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive and Parts IV and IVa of the Habitats Regulations. 
Natural England and CCW will provide more detailed advice to competent authorities to assess the 
implications of particular plans or projects, where appropriate, at the time those plans or projects are 
being considered. 

 
Anyone proposing to undertake plans or projects with a potential impact on site features are encouraged to 
consult Natural England or CCW early in the planning stages to identify possible issues of concern. 
 
The advice in this document is subject to review by Natural England and CCW, for example to: 

 

 

 

add  further  advice  on  monitoring  requirements  in  order  to  assess  the  degree  to  which  the 
conservation objectives are being achieved in future; 
add further advice on operations likely to damage the features for which the SPA, SAC and Ramsar 
Site are selected (under Habitats Regulation 33(2)(b)); 
take account of new information about the SPA, SAC and Ramsar site or its features, or any future 
changes to the designations. 

 
Notes : 
 
CCW  and  Natural  Englands  predecessor  English  Nature,  issued  advice  under  Regulation  33(2)(a)  and 
33(2)(b) in relation to the SPA in February 2005 which is now superseded by this document. 
 
This advice does not cover the terrestrial areas of the Severn Estuary SPA (ie ground which lies behind flood 
defences  are  which  are  not  subject  to  the  tidal  influence  of  the  estuary  and  are  not  therefore  within  the 
European Marine Site. 
 
CCW and Natural England also issued advice under Regulation 33(2)(a) in relation to the cSAC in June 2008 
which is also superseded by this document.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
1.1  Natura 2000 
The European Union Habitats1 and Birds2 Directives are international obligations which set out a number of 
actions to be taken for nature conservation. They represent one of the ways in which EU member states are 
fulfilling the commitments they made at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, for the conservation 
of the Earths biological diversity3.The Habitats Directive aims to promote the maintenance of biodiversity, 
taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements, and sets out measures to maintain or 
restore, natural habitats and species of European Union interest at favourable conservation status4. 
 
European sites include Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated under the 1992 Habitats Directive, 
which  support  natural  habitats  and  species  of  European  importance,  and  Special  Protection  Areas  (SPAs) 
classified under the 1979 Birds Directive, which support internationally important wild bird populations. UK 
and Welsh Assembly Government policy also requires that Ramsar sites should receive the same level of 
protection as European sites5. 

The Habitats Directive is given effect in the UK largely through the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) 
Regulations  1994  (the  Habitats  Regulations)6.    These  Regulations  set  out  the  powers  and  duties  of  UK 
statutory  bodies  towards  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Habitats  Directive.  Under  these 
Regulations,  SACs  together  with  Special  Protection  Areas  (SPAs)  classified  under  the  1979  EC  Birds 
Directive for the conservation of birds, are called European sites and will form a network of conservation 
areas  to  be  known  as  Natura  2000.  Where  SAC  or  SPA  consist  of  marine  areas  they  are  referred  to  as 
European Marine Sites.7 

There  are  various  sources  of  guidance  on  the  legal  framework  for  European  sites  and  European  Marine 
Sites.8 

A note on Ramsar : 
The  Convention  on  Wetlands  of  International  Importance  especially  as  Waterfowl  Habitats  (Ramsar 
Convention) was signed in Ramsar, Iran in 1971. The broad objectives of the Convention are to stem the loss 
and  progressive  encroachment  on  wetlands  now  and  in  the  future,  including  through  the  designation  of 
Ramsar sites.  
 
A habitat can qualify as a Ramsar site for its representation of a wetland, or for the plant or animal species, 
including waterbirds, that it supports.  
 
In accordance with Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (2005) Planning Policy Statement 9: Biological and 
Geological Conservation, Welsh Office Planning Guidance Technical Advice Note No. 5 (TAN5), the DETR 
and  NAW  statements  Ramsar  Sites  in  England  (November  2000)  and  Ramsar  Sites  in  Wales  (February 
                                            
1 Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. 
2 Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds. 
3  Biological diversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, 
terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes 
diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. (1992 International Convention on Biological Diversity, 
Article 2. http://www.biodiv.org/convention/) 
4 A habitat or species is defined as being at favourable conservation status when its natural range and the areas it covers 
within that range are stable or increasing and the specific structure and functions which are necessary for its long term 
maintenance exist and are likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future.

7 Marine areas are defined in the Habitats Regulations as areas continuously or intermittently covered by tidal waters 
or any part of the sea in or adjacent to Great Britain up to the limit of territorial waters.

2001);  Ramsar  sites  classified  under  the  Convention  on  Wetlands  of  International  Importance  should  be 
given the same consideration as European sites when considering plans and projects that may affect them. 
 
1.2  The role of Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales  

Regulation 33 of the Habitats Regulations requires Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales  
(CCW) to advise the relevant authorities9 for each European Marine Site in, or partly in, England and Wales 
as to  
(a) the conservation objectives for that site, and  
(b) any operations which may cause deterioration of natural habitats or the habitats of species, or disturbance 
of species, for which the site has been designated. 
This  document  contains  Natural  England  and  CCWs  advice  under  Regulation  33  in  relation  to  the 
designated sites which comprise the Severn Estuary EMS. 
The Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations 1994, as amended transpose the Habitats Directive into 
law  in  Great  Britain.  They  give  Natural  England  and  CCW  a  statutory  responsibility  to  advise  relevant 
authorities  as  to  the  conservation  objectives  for  European  Marine  Sites  and  Ramsar  Sites  in  England  and 
Wales and to any operations which may cause deterioration of natural habitats or the habitats of species, or 
disturbance of species for which the sites have been designated. This information will be a key component of 
any  management  scheme  that  may  be  developed  for  this  site.  It  will  also  aid  competent  authorities  in 
defining  the  scope  and  nature  of  appropriate  assessment  which  the  Habitats  Directive  requires  to  be 
undertaken for plans and projects having a significant effect on the European site (Habitats Regulations 20, 
48,  50,  60-62  and  85B).  Note  that  Natural  England  and  CCW  will  also  advise  competent  authorities  on 
individual  plans  and  projects  as  they  arise.    Natural  England  and  CCW  are  also  competent  and  relevant 
authorities under the Habitats Regulations. 
 
1.3  The precautionary principle 

The advice on operations contained within this package has been made based on the precautionary principle 
and  any  actions  which  may  need  to  be  taken  in  response  to  concerns  identified  as  a  result  of  monitoring 
undertaken by Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales will also be made on this basis.  All 
forms  of  environmental  risk  should  be  tested  against  the  precautionary  principle  which  means  that  where 
there are real risks to the site, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing 
measures that are likely to be cost effective in preventing such damage.  It does not however imply that the 
suggested cause of such damage must be eradicated unless proved to be harmless and it cannot be used as a 
licence  to  invent  hypothetical  consequences.    Moreover,  it  is  important,  when  considering  whether  the 
information  available  is  sufficient,  to  take  account  of  the  associated  balance  of  likely  costs,  including 
environmental costs, and benefits (DETR & the Welsh Office, 1998). 
 
1.4  The role of other competent and relevant authorities 

The  Conservation  (Natural  Habitats  &c.)  Regulations  1994  require  competent  authorities  to  exercise  their 
functions so as to secure compliance with the requirements of the Habitats and Birds Directives. The term 
competent  authority  includes  all  public  bodies  and  statutory  undertakers.    The  Regulations  identify  a 
number of competent authorities as relevant authorities, with particular functions in relation to European 
Marine  Sites.    In  addition  to  their  duties  as  competent  authorities,  under  Regulation  34  the  relevant 
authorities may establish a management scheme for a European Marine Site under which they shall exercise 
their relevant functions. Such a management scheme should be guided by the information contained in this 
document. Relevant authorities must, within their areas of jurisdiction, have regard to both direct and indirect 
effects on an interest feature of the site. This may include consideration of issues outside the boundary of the 
European Marine Site. 
 

 
                                           
9  The types of bodies that are relevant authorities are identified in Regulation 5 of the Habitats Regulations.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Relevant authorities should ensure that all plans for the area integrate with the management scheme for the 
European  Marine  Site.  Such  plans  may  include  Shoreline  Management  Plans,  the  Environment  Agencys 
Flood  Risk  Management  Strategy  and  Catchment  Flood  Management  Plans,  Local  Development  Plans/ 
Frameworks,  Sites  of  Special  Scientific  Interest  management  plans,  local  Biodiversity  Action  Plans  and 
sustainable  development  strategies  for  estuaries.  This  must  occur  to  ensure  that  there  is  only  a  single 
management  scheme  through  which  all  relevant  authorities  exercise  their  duties  under  the  Conservation 
(Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations 1994. 
 
Relevant authorities also need to have regard to changing circumstances of the European Marine Site and 
may therefore need to modify the management scheme and/or the way in which they exercise their functions 
so  as  to  maintain  the  favourable  condition  of  interest  features  concerned  in  the  long  term.  There  is  no 
requirement for relevant authorities to take any actions outside their statutory functions.  For the purposes of 
this document the term interest feature refers to any of the habitat types or species for which the European 
Marine Sites have been designated. 
 
Under certain circumstances, where another relevant authority is unable to act for legal reasons, or where 
there is no other relevant authority, Natural England and CCW are empowered to use their bylaw-making 
powers under Regulation 36 of the Habitats Regulations 1994. 
 
None  of  the  information  contained  in  this  document  legally  binds  any  organisation  (including  Natural 
England and CCW) to any particular course of action. However, in exercising their functions in accordance 
with the requirements of the Habitats Directive, as required by the Habitats Regulations, and in accordance 
with government policy on Ramsar sites, the relevant authorities should be guided by the advice contained in 
this document. This applies amongst other things to the establishment of a management scheme10, if such a 
scheme is established. 
 
1.5  Responsibilities under other conservation designations 

In addition to its SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site status, parts of the Severn Estuary are  also notified as Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act and Bridgwater Bay is also a 
National  Nature  Reserve.  The  obligations  of  relevant  authorities  and  other  organisations  under  such 
designations are not directly affected by the advice contained in this document. 
 
Relevant authorities and others may have obligations towards the conservation of habitats and species that 
are  not  features  for  which  the  Severn  Estuary  European  Marine  Site  has  been  designated,  and  such 
obligations are not affected by this document. 
 
1.6  Role of advice provided under Regulation 33 

The information provided under Regulation 33 is in two parts: the conservation objectives, and the advice on 
operations. The legal context for each of these elements, the format of the advice and its underlying rationale 
are explained here. Sections 4 (conservation objectives and favourable condition tables) and 5 (operations 
advice) should be read in conjunction with these explanatory notes. 
 
The information contained in this document is based on best available knowledge at time of writing and is 
subject to review at Natural England and CCWs discretion.  
As referred to under section 1.1. above, there are various sources of guidance on the legal framework for 
European sites and European Marine Sites.11

1.6.1  Outline of legal context and purpose of conservation objectives 
 
The conservation objectives for a European Marine Site are intended to represent the aims of the Habitats 
and Birds Directives in relation to that site. The  Habitats Directive requires that  measures taken under it, 
including the designation and management of SACs, be designed to maintain or restore habitats and species 
of European Community importance at favourable conservation status (FCS), as defined in Article 1 of the 
Directive as follows;  
 
Favourable conservation status as defined in Article 1 of the Habitats Directive 
 
Conservation status of a natural habitat means the sum of the influences acting on a natural habitat and its 
typical species that may affect its long-term natural distribution, structure and functions as well as the long-
term survival of its typical species within the territory referred to in Article 2. 
 
The conservative [sic] status of a natural habitat will be taken as favourable when: 
 
 
 

its natural range and the areas it covers within that range are stable or increasing, and 
the  specific  structure  and  functions  which  are  necessary  for  its  long-term  maintenance  exist  and  are 
likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future, and 
conservation status of typical species is favourable as defined in [Article] 1(i). 

 
 
Conservation status of a species means the sum of the influences acting on the species concerned that may 
affect the long-term natural distribution and abundance of its populations within the territory referred to in 
Article 2; 
 
 
The conservation status of a species will be taken as favourable when: 
 
 

population dynamics data on the species concerned indicate that it is maintaining itself on a long-term 
basis as a viable component of its natural habitats, and 
the natural range of the species is neither being reduced nor is likely to be reduced for the foreseeable 
future, and 
there is, and will probably continue to be, a sufficiently large habitat to maintain its populations on a 
long-term basis 

 

 

   
In addition, the Birds Directive requires that, in relation to certain species of birds listed in Annex 1 of the 
Directive  and  regularly  occurring  migratory  species,  special  measures  are  taken  in  order  to  ensure  their 
survival and reproduction in their area of distribution. The species listed in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive 
are the subject of special conservation measures concerning their habitat in order to ensure their survival and 
reproduction  in  their  area  of  distribution.  Species  listed  on  Annex  1  are  in  danger  of  extinction,  rare  or 
vulnerable. Annex 1 species that regularly occur at levels over 1% of the national population meet the SPA 
qualifying criteria.   

Therefore, the conservation objectives for the Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar site  represents Natural 
England and the Countryside Council for Wales' current judgement of the appropriate contribution of the site 
to the achievement of the favourable conservation status of the habitats and species of the European Marine 
Site. The conservation objectives in this document are intended to guide relevant and competent authorities 
in the exercise of their functions to comply with the requirements of the Directives outlined above.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
1.7  Condition 
 
Natural  England  and  CCW  use  the  term  favourable  condition  for  the  condition  represented  by  the 
achievement of the conservation objectives, in other words the desired condition for a designated habitat or a 
species on an individual site. 
 
On many terrestrial European sites, we know sufficient about the required condition of qualifying habitats to 
be able to define favourable condition with confidence.  In contrast understanding the functioning of large, 
varied, dynamic marine and estuarine sites, which experience a variety of pressures resulting from historic 
and current activities, is much more difficult. Consequently it is much harder to precisely define favourable 
condition in sites like the Severn Estuary.  In general the conservation objectives provided are based on a 
working assumption that the current condition of the features is favourable for most attributes.  Nevertheless 
there are certain instances where the assumption does not apply. In particular some of the intertidal habitats 
of  the  Severn  are  subject  to  coastal  squeeze.    Where  existing  problems  have  been  identified,  the  relevant 
objectives reflect this. 
 
If  it  becomes  evident  that  the  condition  of  other  features  is  significantly  degraded,  and  is  therefore 
unfavourable, then restorative management actions will need to be undertaken to return the interest feature to 
favourable condition.  In future revisions of our advice under Regulation 33, Natural England and CCW will 
keep  our  assumption  under  review  in  light  of  ongoing  and  future  monitoring  and  our  developing 
understanding of the features and the factors affecting them.  
 
1.8  Favourable Condition Tables 
 
The  detailed  information  regarding  the  measures  and  targets  that  may  be  used  during  site  monitoring  to 
determine  whether  favourable  condition  is  being  achieved  in  practice  is  presented  within  the  Favourable 
Condition Tables in section 4. 
 
The favourable condition table specifies the following (in columns from left to right): 
 
  Features: interest features for which the SAC, SPA or Ramsar site is selected. 
  Subfeatures: ecologically important sub-divisions of an interest feature. In the case of a habitat interest 
feature,  subfeatures  would  be  component  habitats  or  communities  (eg.  defined  by  type  and/or  by 
geographic  location  within  the  site).    In  the  case  of  species  interest  features,  subfeatures  include  the 
population  itself,  or  any  ecologically  relevant  subdivisions  of  the  population,  and  any  habitats  or 
communities on which it/they depend. 

  Attributes: particular characteristics of the features or sub-features which provide an indication of the 

condition of the feature (eg. total population size, extent of a habitat type). 

  Measures: what exactly about the attributes will be measured, in terms of the units of measurement to be 
used,  arithmetic  nature  and  an  indication  of  the  frequency  at  which  the  measurement  is  taken.    An 
indication of the method that is likely to be used to obtain the observed values of attributes.  The method 
is closely linked to the way in which the measure is expressed.  It is important to note that in many cases 
the precise monitoring method to be used may not be known at this stage. 

  Targets: These define the attribute values that equate to favourable condition.  If changes are observed 
that are significantly different from the target, this will act as a trigger for further investigation as to the 
cause of the change, or remedial management action.  In general the targets in the favourable condition 
table  are  subject  to  natural  processes  as  set  out  in  the  conservation  objectives;  i.e.  where  natural 
processes alone dictate that targets are not met this will not result in the condition of the feature being 
classed as unfavourable.  The term subject to natural processes is explained further in Section 4.1. 

  Comments: notes on the rationale for the use of each attribute and measure. 
 
The favourable condition table is intended to supplement the conservation objectives, including with respect 
to the management of established and ongoing activities, future requirements of monitoring and reporting on 
the condition of the features of the site and, together with the conservation objectives, informs the scope and 

 

13 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
nature  of  any  appropriate  assessment  that  may  be  needed.    The  table  does  not  by  itself  provide  a 
comprehensive basis on which to assess plans and projects as required under the Habitats Regulations.  It 
should  be  noted  that  appropriate  assessments  are  a  separate  activity  to  condition  monitoring,  requiring 
consideration of issues specific to individual plans or projects.  Natural England and CCW will provide more 
detailed advice to competent and relevant authorities to assess the implications of any given plan or project 
under the Regulations, where appropriate, at the time a plan or project is being considered.   
 
The favourable condition table specifies the main types of information that Natural England and CCW may 
use to assess the condition of interest features. On many terrestrial European sites, we know sufficient about 
the  preferred  or  target  condition  of  qualifying  species  and  habitats  to  be  able  to  define  measures  and 
associated targets for all attributes.  In European Marine Sites favourable condition is generally harder to 
define precisely since our knowledge of features is still developing.  Accordingly, in the absence of such 
information, condition of interest features in European Marine Sites will, in the first instance, be assessed 
against targets based on their condition at the time the sites were selected, which may need to be established 
through baseline surveys in many cases.  

 

The information contained within the favourable condition table is not necessarily what will be monitored 
but  provides  a  basis  for  discussions  with  management  and  advisory  groups. The  attributes  and  associated 
measures  and  targets  may  be  modified  over  time.    The  selection  of  attributes  is  based  on  the  current 
understanding of the habitats and species and the available measuring techniques.    
 
The appropriateness of individual attributes as indicators of condition will be reviewed as more knowledge 
of  the  condition  of  interest  features  is  obtained  and/or  survey  and  monitoring  techniques  develop.  
Monitoring of the attributes may be of fairly coarse methodology, underpinned by more rigorous methods on 
specific areas within the site. 
 
The  favourable  condition  table  will  be  an  important,  but  not  the  only,  driver  of  the  site  monitoring 
programme. Other data, such as results from compliance monitoring and appropriate assessments, will also 
have  an  important  role  in  assessing  condition  of  interest  features.  The  monitoring  programme  will  be 
developed as part of the management scheme process through discussion with the relevant authorities and 
other  interested  parties.    Natural  England  and  the  Countryside  Council  for  Wales  will  be  responsible  for 
collating  the  information  required  to  assess  condition,  some  of  which  may  be  collected  by  other 
organisations, and for judging the condition of each feature within the site, taking into account all available 
information and using the favourable condition table as a guide. 
 
The conservation objectives and associated Favourable Condition Tables in this document are intended to 
guide relevant and competent authorities in the exercise of their functions to comply with the requirements of 
the Directives outlined above. 
 
1.9  Advice on operations 
1.9.1  Legal context 

Natural England and CCWs specific duty in Regulation 33 to give advice on operations that are potentially 
damaging needs to be seen in the context of the Habitats Directive, which requires that: 
 
 

the necessary conservation measures are established which correspond to the ecological requirements of 
the habitats and species on the site; 
appropriate steps are taken to avoid deterioration of habitats and significant disturbance of species. 
any  plan  or  project  which  is  likely  to  have  a  significant  effect  on  a  site  is  subject  to  an  appropriate 
assessment in view of the sites conservation objectives. 
 

The  operations  advice,  in  combination  with  the  conservation  objectives,  is  designed  to  assist  relevant 
authorities and other decision-makers in complying with these provisions. The operations advice given in 
this document is without prejudice to other advice given, including the conservation objectives themselves 

 
 

 

14 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
and  other  advice  which  may  be  given  by  Natural  England  and  CCW  from  time  to  time  in  relation  to 
particular operations. 
 
The term operations is taken to cover all types of human activity, irrespective of whether they are under 
any form of regulation or management.12 This is because the obligations in the Directive are  
 
defined  by  the  conservation  requirements  of  the  habitats  and  species,  not  by  existing  regulatory  or 
management regimes. Thus the advice contains reference to operations which may not be the responsibility 
of any of the relevant authorities. 
 
1.9.2  Practical requirements 
 
Operations manifest themselves through one or more factors13.  The conservation status of a given habitat or 
species could potentially be affected by many different types of factor, and hence many different types of 
operation.14 The key practical purpose of the Regulation 33 operations advice is to assist in the identification 
of  priorities  for  management,  by  identifying  operations  to  which  features  are  both  sensitive  and 
vulnerable. Sensitivity is defined as the intrinsic intolerance of a habitat, community or individual of a 
species  to  damage  from  an  external  factor.  Vulnerability  is  defined  as  the  likelihood  of  exposure  of  a 
habitat, community or individual of a species to a factor to which it is sensitive.15 Thus the potential for an 
operation to deteriorate or disturb a feature depends both on the sensitivity of the feature to the operation  
through its associated factors - and the location, intensity, duration and frequency of the operation and the 
factors that it affects or causes. 
 
Formulating the operations advice has three main elements: 
 
1. 
2. 
3. 

Identifying factors to which the features are sensitive.  
Identifying the types of operation that can cause or affect those factors. 
Assessing the likelihood of those factors (and hence the features) being affected by those operations, 
in other words the vulnerability of the feature to those effects. 

 
The first and second of these elements relies on current understanding of the inherent sensitivity of features 
to particular factors, and the effect of operations on factors. Although there will be site-specific elements to 
this information, it may often rely on information from a variety of sources which are not specific to this site. 
The third stage is very site-specific, relying on information about the types, location, intensity, duration and 
so on, of operations occurring or likely to occur in or around the site. 
 
Given  that  in  many  cases,  information  of  the  type  indicated  in  the  previous  paragraph  is  rudimentary,  or 
simply not available a precautionary approach is adopted for the identification of factors and operations. The 
operations  advice  clearly  has  to  be  based  on  the  best  available  knowledge  at  the  time  and  is  subject  to 
continual  review.  It  necessarily  involves  an  element  of  risk  assessment,  both  in  terms  of  assessing  the 
likelihood of an operation or factor occurring, and the likelihood of it having an adverse effect on a feature. 
 
Natural  England  and  CCWs  advice  to  the  relevant  authorities  is  that,  as  a  minimum,  the  extent  and 
management of the operations identified in Section 5 should be reviewed in the context of the conservation 
objectives. The advice should also help to identify the types of plans or projects that would be likely to have 
a significant effect and should be subject to appropriate assessment, noting that such judgements will need to 
be made on a case-specific basis. 

                                           
 
12  The term also includes what the Habitats Directive and Regulations call plans and projects (see footnote 9).  
13  A factor is defined as A component of the physical, chemical, ecological or human environment that may be 
influenced by a natural event or a human activity (Sensitivity and mapping of inshore marine biotopes in the southern 
Irish Sea (Sensmap): Final report. CCW, Bangor, December 2000.) 
14 The complexity of formulating operations advice is compounded by the many-to-many relationship that exists 
between operations and factors, where an operation may manifest itself through several factors, and a factor may be 
affected by several operations, in different ways and to different magnitudes.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
 
The  advice  in  Section  5  of  this  document  is  not  a  list  of  prohibited  operations,  or  operations  necessarily 
requiring  consultation  with,  or  consent16  from,    Natural  England  or  CCW.  The  input  of  the  relevant 
authorities  and  others  is  a  legal  and  practical  necessity  in  determining  the  management  needs  of  the  site. 
Thus, the operations advice is provided specifically with the intention of initiating dialogue between Natural 
England, CCW and the relevant authorities. 
 
Note :  The advice on operations previously issued for the SPA in February 2005 is superseded by the advice 
given in Section 5. 
 

                                            
16 However, in relation to land included within the European Marine Site, which has been notified as a Site of Special 
Scientific Interest (SSSI), owners or occupiers require Natural England or CCWs consent for any operations included 
in the SSSI notification, and statutory bodies intending to carry out or permit potentially damaging operations must 
notify Natural England or CCW and comply with certain other provisions. (Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, section 
28, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, section 75). General guidance on the operation of 
SSSIs is given in the CCW leaflet Sites of Special Scientific Interest: A guide for landowners and occupiers 
(Countryside Council for Wales, Bangor, 2001).

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
2.1  Qualifying interest features of the Severn Estuary / Mor Hafren SAC  
 
The Severn Estuary has been designated an SAC on the basis that it supports occurrences of habitat types 
and species listed in Annexes I and II respectively of the Habitats Directive that are considered important in 
a European context and meeting the criteria in Annex III of the Directive. These are the interest features of 
the SAC and are listed in the Table 2 and their relationships are shown in Figure 1. 
 
The designation includes an overarching estuaries  feature within which subtidal sandbanks, intertidal 
mudflats and sandflats, Altlantic salt meadows and reefs (of Sabellaria alveolata) and three species of 
migratory fish are defined as both features in their own right and as sub-features of the estuary feature.  
 
In addition hard substrate habitats including eel grass beds, the estuary-wide assemblage of fish species 
and the assemblage of waterfowl species  (for which the Ramsar Site and SPA are specifically designated) 
are identified as notable estuarine assemblages which are an intrinsic part of the estuary ecosystem  these 
are therefore covered by the estuaries feature.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
2.2 Qualifying interest features of the Severn Estuary / Mor Hafren SPA  

The  Severn  Estuary  was  classified  as  an  SPA  on  13  July  1995  (subsuming  a  previously  designated  SPA 
called the Upper Severn Estuary) .  The 1995 citation accompanying the classification is the baseline for the 
advice issued in this document.  The qualifying interest features of the Severn Estuary SPA are shown in 
Table 3.   

 It should be noted that since designation changes in bird numbers have occurred in relation to the qualifying 
thresholds, which have themselves changed.  These changes are highlighted by the SPA review published by 
the  JNCC  and  details  are  also  shown  in  Table  3.    These  changes  are  likely  to  be  the  subject  of  formal 
changes to the SPA designation in due course, however at present the legally protected species remain those 
in  the  original  1995  citation.  (Note  :  Further  information  on  the  peak  counts  of  the  SPA  species  and 
waterfowl assemblage between 1988/9 and 2006/07 are given in Appendix 11.) 
 
The SPA within the European Marine Site boundary includes saltmarshes and the adjacent extensive areas of 
intertidal mud, sand and rocky shores.   All these habitats provide essential food and resting places for the 
wide range of wintering and migratory waterfowl and are therefore identified as key supporting habitats 
for  the  conservation  of  these  species.    The  relationship  between  the  features  and  supporting  habitats 
supporting habitats is shown in Table 3.  The supporting habitats are mapped in Appendix 8  to show their 
distribution and extent.

The wintering waterfowl assemblage  includes all 
regularly occurring waterfowl. Species that qualify 
as a listed component of the assemblage include all 
the internationally important regularly occurring 
migratory species as well as the Annex 1 wintering 
species. The list also includes species present in 
nationally important numbers or species whose 
populations exceed 2,000 individuals 
In the original citation, in winter, it is stated that 
the area regularly supported 68,026 individual 
waterbirds *4. In the SPA Review it is stated that 
the area regularly supports 93,986 individual 
waterfowl  in winter *5. In the Natura 2000 form, 
in winter, it is stated that the area regularly 
supports 84,317 waterfowl *6.

Notes : 
1.  Previous advice issued in respect of the Severn Estuary SPA in February 2005 excluded Gadwall for the listed species of 
internationally important populations of regularly occurring migratory birds as they were considered not to use the European 
Marine Site area to any significant degree.  Further recent evidence (2002/03 Low Tide Bird Counts)  has demonstrated that this 
species does make use of areas within the European Marine Site and has consequently now been included. 
2.    The  SPA  review  has  identified  that  since  the  classification  of  the  Severn  Estuary  SPA  in  1995  the  Severn  Estuary  now 
supports nationally important populations of Mallard, Lapwing and Shoveler.

Each interest feature has a conservation objective in Section 4 of this document.  Reference should also be 
made to sections of this document that relate to the Severn Estuary SAC interest features  (particularly with 
respect  to  the  conservation  requirements  of  the  supporting  habitats)  and  the  Severn  Estuary  Ramsar  Site 
interest features.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
2.3   Qualifying interest features of the Severn Estuary/ Mor 
         Hafren Ramsar Site   
 
 
The Severn Estuary was classified as a Ramsar Site on 13 July 1995 (subsuming a previously designated 
Upper Severn Estuary Ramsar Site).  The 1995 citation is the basis for the advice issued in this document as 
this defines the legally protected species covered by the Ramsar designation at this time.  
 
It should be noted that a number of changes have been made to the criteria since the listing of the Severn 
Estuary Ramsar Site and it is these new (2005) criteria which are now presented on the JNCC website used 
by many authorities as a reference source.  For completeness qualification under both the criteria used at the 
time of 1995 Ramsar designation and the revised 2005 criteria have been outlined in Table 5 which provides 
a confirmation of the defined Ramsar features for which Conservation Objectives have been written.   
 
The qualifying interest features of the Severn Estuary Ramsar Site overlap with those of the Severn Estuary 
SPA and SAC. To facilitate the development of integrated  objectives across the designations the Ramsar 
criteria have been interpreted and  the Ramsar features defined so that they are consistent with those already 
identified in the SAC and SPA sections of this document.  
 
 
Table 5 :  confirmation of Ramsar features in context of 1995 and 2005 Ramsar criteria  

Ramsar Features  
(for which conservation objectives 
have been written) 
 
Ramsar interest feature 1: 
 
*Estuaries  
 - characteristic physical form and 
flow,  estuarine habitat communities 
and  species assemblages 

 - estuarine habitat communities and 
species assemblages 

 

Ramsar interest feature 2: 
 
Assemblage of migratory fish species 
: 
Sea Lamprey 
 River Lamprey  
Twaite Shad  
Allis Shad   
Salmon   
Sea Trout   
Eel  

Criteria at designation (1995) 
(original criteria)  

 
Criterion 1 : qualifies due to its immense tidal 
range affecting both the physical environment 
and biological communities present 

 
Criterion 2b : qualifies due to its unusual 
estuarine communities, reduced species diversity 
and high productivity.  The high tidal range leads 
to strong tidal streams and high turbidity, 
producing communities characteristic of the 
extreme physical conditions of liquid mud and 
tide swept sand and rock 
 
 
 
Criterion 2c : qualifies as it is important for the 
run of migratory fish between sea and river via 
estuary.  Species include Salmon Salmo salar, 
sea trout S. trutta, sea lamprey Petromyzon 
marinus, river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis, allis 
shad Alosa alosa, twaite shad A. fallax, and eel 
Anguilla anguilla. 

* The wider estuarine fish assemblage 
is covered as a notable species 
assemblage sub feature of the SAC  
Estuaries feature 

 

 

25 

Revised Criteria (2005)  
(criteria currently used on  JNCC 
website) 

 
Criterion 1 : qualifies due to immense 
tidal range (second-largest in world), 
this affects both the physical 
environment and biological 
communities. 
 
Criterion 3 : qualifies due to its 
unusual estuarine communities, 
reduced diversity and high productivity 
 

 
 
Criterion 4 : qualifies as it is 
important for the run of migratory fish 
between sea and river via estuary.  
Species include Salmon Salmo salar, 
sea trout S. trutta, sea lamprey 
Petromyzon marinus, river lamprey 
Lampetra fluviatilis, allis shad Alosa 
alosa, twaite shad A. fallax, and eel 
Anguilla anguilla. 
 
Criterion 8 : qualifies as the fish 
assemblage of the whole estuarine and 
river system is one of the most diverse 
in Britain, with over 110 species 
recorded.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
3.  General  description  of  the  Severn  Estuary  and  its  designated 

features  

 
Introduction 
 
The Severn Estuary is the largest example of a coastal plain estuary in the United Kingdom and one of the 
largest estuaries in Europe. The overall area of the European and International conservation designations is  
73,715.4 ha (see Appendix 1) of which roughly two thirds is composed of subtidal habitats (stable sandbanks 
and shifting sediments of gravel, sand and mud) and one third is composed of intertidal habitats (tide washed 
mud and sand, saltmarshes and rocky shores). 

The estuary lies in the broad Severn Vale, with most of the sediments on the margins of the estuary having 
accumulated since the last ice age.  As with many other estuaries in England and Wales, it has been a focus 
for human activity, a location for settlement, a source of food, water and raw materials and a gateway for 
trading and exploration.  The Estuary and its coastal hinterland support the cities of Cardiff, Bristol, Newport 
and  Gloucester.  Today,  major  industries  are  sited  around  the  Estuarys  shores.    There  are  modern  port 
installations, chemical processing companies and nuclear power stations among others.  Exploitation of the 
natural  resources  includes  commercial  shrimp  fishing  and  fishing  for  salmon  using  putchers,  lave  nets, 
draught nets and bag nets.  The Severn supports an important eel and elver fishery. Aggregate extraction also 
occurs within the estuary.  
 
Alongside all these competing activities, the Estuary also supports a wide array of habitats and species of 
international importance for nature conservation.  

Human activity has increasingly influenced the character of the marginal wetland mudflats and marshes, with 
extensive land claim occurring during and since the Roman period. Sediment flows and fluxes affecting the 
estuary are of particular importance for estuarine processes and ecology and the morphology of the estuary is 
constantly  changing  due  to  the  complex  hydrodynamics.    Sediment  deposits  provide  essential  material  to 
maintain the mudflats, sandflats and saltmarsh.   Estuary-wide fluctuations in the wind-wave climate over 
recent  centuries  have  led  to  major  movements  of  the  high-tide  shoreline,  and  some  reclaimed  lands  have 
been  lost  (Allen,  1990,  Atkins,  W.S.  2004).  In  addition,  the  Severn  Estuary  CHaMP  (ABPMer,  2006) 
predicts losses of intertidal mudflats and sandflats and saltmarsh habitats over the next 100 years in response 
to rising sea-level.  

A  number  of  habitats  and  species  have  also  been  recognised  through  the  designation  of  several  Sites  of 
Special  Scientific  Interest  (most  notably,  the  Upper  Severn  Estuary,  Severn  Estuary  and  Bridgwater  Bay 
SSSIs in the 1980s) which underpin the European and International designations.   
 
The following sections briefly describe each of the main habitat and species features covered by the three 
designations and the inter-relationships between them. All feature descriptions are based on best available 
knowledge at the present time and in some cases this is limited. For example there is limited information on 
the extent of the subtidal reef habitat within the estuary. Maps showing the distribution of the habitats are 
indicative only and the advice in this document is provided on the basis of current knowledge and may be 
subject to change as knowledge improves.

3.1  Estuaries 
 
3.1.1  Range 
 
Estuaries are habitat complexes which comprise an interdependent mosaic of subtidal and intertidal habitats, 
which are closely associated with surrounding terrestrial habitats. Many of these habitats, such as mudflats 
and sandflats not covered by sea water at low tide, saltmarshes, sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea 
water all the time and reefs, are identified as Annex I habitat types in their own right. 
  
Estuaries are defined as the downstream part of a river valley, subject to the tide and extending from the limit 
of brackish water. There is a gradient of salinity from freshwater in the river to increasingly marine 
conditions towards the open sea.  
 
Estuaries are widespread throughout the Atlantic coasts of Europe. Approximately one-quarter of the area of 
estuaries in north-western Europe occurs in the UK. The UK has over 90 estuaries18. 
 
The selection of estuary sites has taken account of the UKs EU responsibility for this habitat type, and the 
SAC series contains a high proportion of the total UK resource. Sites have been selected to represent the 
geographical range of estuaries in the UK, and to encompass examples of the four geomorphological sub-
types (coastal plain, bar-built, complex, and ria estuaries) and the associated range of communities. Selection 
has generally favoured larger estuaries, as they display a wider variety of habitats, but smaller estuaries have 
also been selected where they have specific features of interest, such as undisturbed transitions from marine 
to terrestrial habitats, or are representative of a particular geomorphological sub-type. 
 
The Severn Estuary is the largest example of a coastal plain estuary in the UK, and one of the largest 
estuaries in Europe. It contributes approximately 30% of the UK Natura 2000 resource for estuaries, by 
area.19 
 
3.1.2  Extent and Distribution 
 
The extent of the Estuary feature is 73678 ha. 
 
The Severn Estuary SAC covers the extent of the tidal influence from an upstream limit between Frampton 
and Awre in  Gloucestershire out seawards to a line  drawn between Penarth Head in Wales and Hinckley 
point in Somerset.  It includes subtidal and intertidal areas landward to the line of high ground and flood 
defences (banks and walls) that provide the limit of tidal inundation.   
 
The Estuary is an over-arching feature which incorporates all aspects of the physical, chemical and 
biological  attributes  of  the  estuary  as  an  ecosystem.    The  physical  nature  of  the  tidal  regime 
determines  not  only  the  structure  of  the  estuary  and  individual  habitats  but  also  the  conditions 
affecting it and the biological communities it therefore supports.  
 
3.1.3  Structure and Function 
 
The Severn Estuary is important for its immense tidal range, which affects both the physical environment 
and the diversity and productivity of the biological communities.   The tidal range is the second largest in the 
world,  reaching  in  excess  of  13  m  at  Avonmouth20.    This  macrotidal  environment  is  partly  due  to  the 
estuarys funnel shape which concentrates the tidal wave as it moves up the Bristol Channel.  Tidal currents

are also amplified and exceed 7 metres per second close to Avonmouth (British Geological Survey, 1996).  
These factors make the estuary important in representing one of the most dynamic estuarine systems in the 
UK , Europe and the world.  
 
There are several major rivers, including the Taff, Usk, Wye, Severn, Avon and Parrett which feed into the 
estuary, and influence the salinity regime. Together these rivers tend to produce a marked east-west salinity 
gradient  and  a  range  of  conditions  varying  from  brackish  to  fully  saline,  depending  on  the  season  and 
rainfall,  which  in  turn  influences  the  occurrence  and  distribution  of  habitats  and  species  throughout  the 
estuary and its fringes.   
 
Fine sediments which are mainly derived from erosion of the intertidal zone and suspended sediments in 
river water entering the estuary create high turbidity, which has its highest average level between 
Avonmouth and the outer part of Bridgwater Bay (British Geological Survey, 1996, ABPMer, 2006).  The 
strong tidal currents create a highly dynamic environment and the resultant scouring of the seabed and high 
turbidity give rise to low diversity communities.  The Severn has an extreme type of hydrodynamic and 
sedimentary regime which distinguishes it from other estuaries and which dominates the whole system.  It is 
estimated that the estuary carries 10 million tons of suspended sediments on spring tides (Kirby & 
Parker,1983; Kirby, 1986).  Such conditions were initiated by the start of sea-level rise in late glacial times, 
with some evidence for steady sedimentation persisting for at least 5000 years, during which there has been a 
steady rise in sea level of 5 m, a trend which is continuing at present (British Geological Survey, 1996). 
Defra guidance21 indicates sea level rise for Wales and the South West  to be 3.5 mm per annum to 2025, 
rising to 8 mm per annum (2025-2055), 11.5 mm (2055-2085) and 14.5 mm (2085-2115).  
 
3.1.4  Typical Habitats and Species 
 
The extreme hydrodynamic and sedimentary conditions essentially determine the type of habitats and species 
present and result in characteristic animal and plant communities. Typical species for each habitat are given 
in the individual habitat sections. 
 
The predominant unconsolidated sediments are muds and sands which form the basis of the structure of the 
estuarine  habitats  which  include  saltmarshes  (section  3.5),  intertidal  mud  and  sand  flats  (section  3.4)  and 
subtidal sand banks (section 3.3), mixed mud and sand, rock outcrops, boulder and shingle shores (section 
3.7)  as  well  as    biogenic  (worm  built)  reefs  (section  3.6).  There  are  also  sandy  beaches  on  the  southern 
shores in the outer part of the estuary, backed by sand dunes. 
 
The intertidal zone of mudflats, sandbanks, rocky platforms and saltmarsh is one of the largest and most 
important in Britain and this range of habitats provide an ecosystem of great importance for a wide range of 
fish (section 3.8) and bird (section 3.9) species  for  feeding, breeding, resting and migration.  
 
3.1.5  Natural Processes 
 
The  structure  of  estuaries  is  largely  determined  by  geomorphological  and  hydrographic  factors,  with  the 
original shaping forces having their beginnings in the geological origins of the adjacent land areas and the 
influence of major geological events such as ice ages and periods of higher and lower sea levels. 
 
The shape of the estuaries, their macro- and micro-topography, and bathymetry, are important components of 
the character of the habitats and influences the distribution and abundance of marine life, i.e. the features 
typical species.  It is both determined by, and influences, natural environmental processes and consequently, 
can be impacted either directly or indirectly (through changes to natural processes) by man. 
 
Estuaries  are  complex  dynamic  systems  that  have  a  natural  tendency  to  accumulate  sediment,  thereby 
changing their form from their original Holocene morphology to a state where tidal energy is dissipated by

sub-  and  intertidal  sediment  banks.  The  width  and  depth  of  the  estuary  will  therefore  change  over  time 
towards a state of dynamic equilibrium or most probable state.  
 
The velocities of currents passing through the mouth are determined partly by the tidal range and partly by 
the cross sectional area of the mouth itself. If these velocities are higher than the sediment erosion threshold, 
erosion  will  widen  the  channel  and  lower  velocities  will  ensue.  If  velocities  are  lower  than  the  sediment 
depositional threshold, deposition will narrow the mouth and higher velocities will ensue. In this way, an 
equilibrium  cross  section  will  evolve  which  balances  tidal  prism,  velocities  and  erosion/depositional 
thresholds. Sea level rise means that estuaries will show a natural tendency to migrate inland (roll-over) and 
may erode at the mouth. Where changes in extent are attributable to the estuary adjusting to equilibrium, then 
the feature should be determined favourable. Where this process is constrained by hard sea defence, then this 
would  be  considered  as  coastal  squeeze.  (JNCC  Common  Standards  Monitoring  Guidance  for  Estuaries 
(version 4)).  
 
A complex pattern and combination of physical, chemical and biological conditions and processes operates 
within  estuaries,  with  many  parameters  varying  temporally  and  spatially.  These  parameters  establish  the 
baseline  conditions  in  the  estuary  and  continually  shape  the  estuaries  and  the  habitats  and  wildlife  they 
support. The key parameters are: the flood hydrograph22; the nature of the catchment and its influence on 
freshwater flow and nutrient and sediment input; the nature of the estuary sediment; and the relatively high 
sediment levels in the estuaries resulting in low water retention within the estuary system and exposure of 
significant proportions of sediment at low tide. The biological communities of the estuaries have developed 
in response to these prevailing conditions and the daily patterns of water flow, exposure, sediment movement 
and water chemistry. 
 
3.2  Subtidal sandbanks 
 
3.2.1  Range 
 
Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time (subtidal sandbanks) consist of sandy 
sediments that are permanently covered by shallow sea water, typically at depths of less than 20 m below 
chart datum (but sometimes including channels or other areas greater than 20 m deep). The habitat comprises 
distinct banks (i.e. elongated, rounded or irregular mound shapes) which may arise from horizontal or 
sloping plains of sandy sediment. Where the areas of horizontal or sloping sandy habitat are closely 
associated with the banks, they are included within the Annex I type.   

Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time occur widely on the Atlantic coasts of north-
west Europe, and occur widely around the UK coast. They are widespread in inshore waters (within 12 
nautical miles of the coast) and also occur offshore in the southern North Sea and in the Irish Sea (between 
12 and 200 nautical miles). 

The UK SAC series includes large sublittoral sandbanks showing good habitat structure and function. The 
selected sites represent the range of variation within the four main sub-types (gravelly and clean sands, 
muddy sands, eelgrass beds, and maerl beds), which are often associated with different physiographic 
features (e.g. estuaries, open coast, bays, sea lochs). The differing character of this habitat around the UK 
coast has also been taken into account. 

The Severn Estuary subtidal sandbanks can be considered to contribute to the gravelly and clean sand 
sandbank resource.  The Severn Estuary contributes approximately 3% of the UK Natura 2000 resource for 
subtidal sandbanks, by area.23

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
3.2.2  Extent and Distribution 
 
The subtidal sandbanks are largely restricted to the middle and outer parts of the estuary.  The sand banks of 
the Middle and Welsh Grounds are relatively permanent sandbank features in the Severn Estuary, along with 
other long established sandbank features at Cardiff Grounds and in Bridgwater Bay. The tops of these banks 
are intertidal, and the permanently submerged parts of the banks are considered to contribute to the subtidal 
sandbanks habitat 

 

There are other areas of subtidal sandbank habitat within the Estuary, again sometimes the top of the bank 
may  be  exposed  at  low  tide,  with  the  submerged  sections  contributing  to  the  subtidal  sandbanks  habitat. 
These  banks  are  more  ephemeral  in  nature,  but  are  still  considered  part  of  the  feature,  and  reflect  the 
dynamic nature of the Severn Estuary. The areas where ephemeral subtidal sandbanks are known to occur 
include areas offshore from Avonmouth and at English Grounds (near Clevedon).  
The  approximate  area  of  the  more  permanent  subtidal  sandbanks  is  1,300  hectares  and  there  are 
approximately 10,440 hectares of associated ephemeral sandbanks.  Areas of associated sediments have been 
defined  by  using  the  sediment  environments  of  the  Bristol  Channel  Marine  Aggregates  Resources  and 
Constraints project, commissioned by the National Assembly for Wales (Posford Duvivier and ABP, 2000). 
Further detail is given in section 4.1.2.1. 
 
3.2.3  Structure and Function 
 
The subtidal area of the Severn Estuary is subject to strong tidal currents resulting in the high mobility of 
sediments which range from gravely to muddy sands.  The high mobility of the sediments and high turbidity 
means that these habitats only support animals that can tolerate the shifting seabed and scouring action of 
suspended sand.   
 
As described above the subtidal sandbanks habitat includes some long established and relatively permanent 
sandbank features and associated sediments which form more ephemeral sandbanks. The sediments of both 
the more permanent sandbank features and the associated sediments (ephemeral banks) together comprise the 
subtidal sandbanks feature of the SAC (see map in Appendix 3).   
 
These subtidal areas play an important role in holding and supplying sediment for other habitats notably the 
intertidal  mud  and  sandflats,  saltmarshes  and  reef  features  and  it  is  likely  that  subtidal  invertebrate 
communities play a role as a food resource for some species of the fish assemblage  feature of the SAC and 
Ramsar Site.  
 
3.2.4  Typical species 
 
The  subtidal    sandbanks  feature  has  two  distinct  sub-features  composed  of  communities  which  are 
determined principally by the degree of sediment mobility, grade of sediments, mix of sediments (in terms of 
proportions of sand and mud) and salinity.  
 
The  first  sub-feature  is  composed  of  sand  and  muddy  sand  communities  dominated  by  worms,  and 
burrowing shrimps which can tolerate the high sediment mobility.  The second sub feature is composed of 
mud and sandy mud dominated communities which are slightly more stable and support a greater abundance 
of burrowing worms. 
 
The  typical  species  of  these  communities  include  a  range  of  worms,  shrimps,  snails  and  bivalves.    The 
species diversity of these habitats is often low but overall biomass can be high.  
 
3.2.5  Natural Processes 
 
Subtidal sandbanks are dynamic features with their size, shape, aspect and orientation, as well as the macro- 
and  micro-topography  and  sediment  characteristics  largely  determined  by  the  sediment  supply  and  the 
influence of the hydrodynamic processes affecting each bank.  They change shape over time and while some 
are ephemeral others may be relatively stable and long established. Mobile sediments that form temporary 

 

34

sandbanks are considered to be associated sediments that should be retained in the system but their location 
may change.  
 
 
3.3  Intertidal mudflats and sandflats 
 
3.3.1  Range 
 
Intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  are  submerged  at  high  tide  and  exposed  at  low  tide.  They  form  a  major 
component of  Estuaries and  Large shallow inlets and bays in the UK but also occur extensively along the 
open coast and in lagoonal inlets. The physical structure of the intertidal flats ranges from mobile, coarse-
sand beaches on wave-exposed coasts to stable, fine-sediment mudflats in estuaries and other marine inlets. 
This habitat type can be divided into three broad categories (clean sands, muddy sands and muds), although 
in practice there is a continuous gradation between them. Within this range the plant and animal communities 
present vary according to the type of sediment, its stability and the salinity of the water. 
  
Mudflats  and  sandflats  not  covered  by  sea  water  at  low  tide  are  a  widespread  habitat  type  on  coasts  of 
Atlantic Europe, particularly around the North Sea, and occur widely throughout the UK. 

Sites have been selected to encompass the range of geographical, physical and ecological variation shown by 
this habitat type in the UK. Examples of clean sands, muddy sands, and mudflats have all been included. 
Sites with large areas of intertidal flats, as well as a range of environmental conditions and an associated 
diversity of communities, were favoured. 

The intertidal part of the Severn Estuary supports extensive mudflats and sandflats.  These cover an area of 
approximately 20,300 ha - the fourth largest area in a UK estuary and representing approximately 7 % of the 
total  UK  resource  of  this  habitat  type  (approximately  10%  of  the  UK  Natura  2000  resource  for  Intertidal 
mudflats and sandflats, by area.24) 
 
The  intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  of  the  Severn  Estuary  are  representative  of  estuarine  mudflats  and 
sandflats influenced by strong tidal streams and extreme silt loading.  
 
3.3.2  Extent and Distribution 
 
The  Intertidal  mudlfats  and  sandflats  feature  in  the  Severn  Estuary  covers  an  area  of  approximately 
20,300ha. 
 
The  Intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  feature  is  distributed  throughout  the  Severn  Estuary  with  extensive 
mudflats fronting the Welsh shore and Bridgwater Bay, and large banks of clean sands in the more central 
parts of the estuary at Middle and Welsh Grounds.  
 
3.3.3  Structure and Function 
 
This  habitat  type  can  be  divided  into  three  broad  categories  (which  form  the  three  main  sub-features 
identified for this feature in the Severn Estuary), clean sands and gravels, muddy sands, and muds, although 
in  practice  there  is  a  continuous  gradation  between  them  (Countryside  Council  for  Wales,  2006;  English 
Nature, 2006). The composition of the sediments and level of consolidation are the most important factors in 
determining the fauna of these communities and individual species distribution is largely dependant on the 
salinity which limits the penetration of marine species upstream where freshwater influences are strongest.

35 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
The  gravel  and  clean  sand  communities  occur  predominantly  in  the  mid  and  upper  parts  of  the  estuary 
forming  large  banks  in  the  centre  the  estuary  (Frampton  Sands,  Lydney  Sands,  Oldbury  Sands,  Bedwyn 
Sands and the Welsh Grounds) through which the main tidal channel flows keeping sediments mobile.   
 
The sandy mud communities occur in restricted locations forming the transition between the clean sand and 
mud communities particularly in the mid estuary and at the lowest extremes of the tide and at the flanks of 
the main channel.    
 
The  mud  communities  form  in  the  sheltered  edges  of  the  estuary  particularly  where  the  coastline  forms 
natural embayments and are predominantly found in the mid to outer estuary at Bridgewater  Bay and on the 
Cardiff  and  Newport  frontages  although  a  narrow  fringe  of  these  communities  is  present  throughout  the 
estuary.  These communities take the form of firm mud banks adjacent to the saltmarshes often with a liquid 
mud surface kept fluid by the high tidal currents.   
 
3.3.4  Typical Species 
 
Muddy  areas  in  the  Estuary  such  as  those  between  Cardiff  to  Newport  are  generally  soft  and  mobile, 
colonised  by  high  densities  of  relatively  few  species  characterised  by  Hediste  diversicolor  and  Macoma 
balthica. Other typical species include Nephtys hombergii, Hydrobia ulvae, Tubificoides benedii, Streblospio 
shrubsolii, Pygospio elegans, and Enchytraeidae. Corophium volutator is also widespread in these muddy 
areas  especially  near  the  mudflat  saltmarsh  boundary.  In  some  mid  shore  areas  with  sandier  sediments 
Arenicola marina, and Macoma balthica are present.  
 
Lower  shore  coarse  sand  banks  such  as  Bedwyn  and  Oldbury,  are  dominated  by  mobile  species  such  as 
Bathyporeia  pelagica,  Eurydice  pulchra,  and  Nephtys  cirrosa.  The  south  side  of  the  lower  estuary  has 
pockets  of  littoral  muddy  sand  on  the  upper  shore  characterised  by  Macoma  balthica,  Hydrobia  ulvae, 
Bathyporeia pelagica, and Nephtys hombergii. Lower down the shore the sediments become muddier and 
support species such as Scoloplos armiger, Aphelochaeta marioni and Hediste diversicolor. 
 
Upstream of  Sudbrook the infauna becomes less diverse  as the  salinity decreases. Mud flats here support 
ragworm Hediste diversicolor, patchy Baltic tellin Macoma balthica and laver spire shell Hydrobia ulvae, 
with occasional peppery furrow shell Scrobicularia plana near the back of the shore.  Within the pills along 
the site and in the upper reaches towards the road crossing the soft mud often supports few species including 
Hediste diversicolor and Oligochaeta spp.  
 
The  high  biomass  of  invertebrates  in  the  mudflats  of  the  Severn  provide  an  important  food  source  for  a 
diverse range and large number of fish and benthic predators.  These intertidal areas are therefore important 
in supporting the fish assemblage subfeature of the SAC and Ramsar Site.    
 
Mudflats also provide a valuable feeding, roosting and resting area for a wide range of species of wading 
birds  and  waterfowl  and  are  therefore  important  supporting  habitats  for  the  wintering  and  passage  bird 
features of the SPA and Ramsar Site. 
 
3.3.5  Natural Processes 
 
Intertidal mudflats and sandflats are dynamic features. Their distribution, extent, shape, topography, aspect 
and  orientation  is  the  product  of  complex  interaction  between  hydrodynamic  and  sediment  transport 
processes,  sediment  supply  and  coastal  morphology.  Hydrographic  functions  that  structure  intertidal 
mudflats and sandflats encompass highly dynamic hydrodynamic and other properties that vary with short 
and long-term natural cycles, climate influences and stochastic events. 
 
The  structure  of  intertidal  muflats  and  sandflats  varies  depending  on  the  physical  conditions  and  forces 
acting on them (in particular the degree of exposure to wave action and tidal currents) as well as the nature of 
the  sediments  occurring  in  any  one  location.  The  sediments  vary  from  mobile  coarse  sand  in  more  wave 
exposed areas to stable, fine sediment expanses of mudflat in estuaries and other marine inlets.  
 

 

 

36 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  support  a  variety  of  different  wildlife  communities.  These  are 
predominantly infaunal communities of a variety of different animal species such as worms, molluscs and 
crustaceans living within the sediment habitat. The type of sediment, its stability and the salinity of the water 
have a large influence on the wildlife species present. 
 
 
3.4  Atlantic salt meadow  
 
3.4.1  Range 
 
Atlantic salt meadows develop when halophytic vegetation colonises soft intertidal sediments of mud and 
sand  in  areas  protected  from  strong  wave  action.  This  vegetation  forms  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of 
saltmarshes, where tidal inundation still occurs but with decreasing frequency and duration. A wide range of 
community types is represented and the saltmarshes can cover large areas, especially where there has been 
little  or  no  enclosure  on  the  landward  side.  The  vegetation  varies  with  climate  and  the  frequency  and 
duration  of  tidal  inundation.  Grazing  by  domestic  livestock  is  particularly  significant  in  determining  the 
structure  and  species  composition  of  the  habitat  type  and  in  determining  its  relative  value  for  plants,  for 
invertebrates and for wintering or breeding waterfowl. 

This  Annex I  type  is  predominantly  found  on  Atlantic  coasts  in  western  Europe.    Atlantic  salt  meadows 
occur on North Sea, English Channel and Atlantic shores. There are more than 29,000 ha of the habitat type 
in the UK, mostly in the large, sheltered estuaries of south-east, south-west and north-west England and in 
south Wales. Smaller areas of saltmarsh are found in Scotland.  

Sites have been selected to cover the geographical range and ecological variation of Atlantic salt meadows in 
the UK. The sites selected are for the most part the largest examples of this habitat type, with good structure 
and function, and which support a well-developed zonation of plant communities within the saltmarsh. There 
are transitions to other high-quality habitat assemblages at many of the sites that have been selected. Sites 
with complete sequences of vegetation and transitions to other habitats, such as sand dunes, represent the 
range of variation of the habitat type, and this has been an important consideration in site selection. 

The Severn Estuary holds the largest aggregation of saltmarsh in the south and south-west of the UK.  It 
covers  approximately  1,400  ha,  representing  about  4%  of  the  total  area  of  saltmarsh  in  the  UK  (Dargie, 
2000).   
 
3.4.2  Extent and Distribution 
 
The Severn Estuary is fringed by saltmarsh. The huge tidal range in the Severn Estuary has led to extensive 
saltmarsh community development with an expanded zonation. 
 
3.4.3  Structure and Function 
 
The saltmarshes of the Severn Estuary have four principal zones corresponding to the four main sub-features 
that have been identified for this feature.  Two of these zones (the lower to mid marsh communities and the 
mid to upper marsh communities) contain the principle saltmarsh types which are defined as Atlantic salt 
meadow as per the Annex 1 habitat description.  However these occur in an intimate mosaic and in transition 
with  the  communities  of  the  other  two  zones  (in  the  pioneer  saltmarsh  and  transitional  high  marsh 
communities) which are therefore considered in this advice as part of the feature.  Section 4.1.4.1 and Table 
11 provide further details of these zones and their typical species.  
 
The pioneer saltmarsh communities play an important role in saltmarsh development as colonising plants (eg 
Spartina sp.and Salicornia sp.) stabilise and trap sediments. The upper marsh transitions to terrestrial and 
freshwater habitats support a range of nationally scarce and uncommon plant species and support tidal debris 
strandlines of value for invertebrates which are important components of the estuary feature. 
 

 

37 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Some of the saltmarshes show a sequence of saltmarsh cliffs or steps related to past cycles of accretion and 
erosion and in places the saltmarshes are also cut transversely by pills where freshwater streams enter the 
estuary. These features add diversity to the saltmarsh by initiating new patterns of species zonation.   Recent 
monitoring  has  identified  that  there  is  a  complicated  present  day  pattern  of  erosion  and  accretion  of  the 
saltmarshes throughout the estuary and some parts appear to be exhibiting the effects of coastal squeeze  the 
constriction of saltmarsh habitats between rising sea levels and hard defences at the back of the saltmarsh .   
 
Saltmarshes and mudflats have an important role to play in estuarine processes, both through the recycling of 
nutrients within the estuary and through their role as soft sea defences, dissipating wave energy.  They are 
highly  productive  biologically,  providing  organic  material  that  support  other  features  within  the  marine 
ecosystem and they also have an important physical role, acting as a sediment store to the estuary as a whole. 
 
Saltmarshes also provide a valuable feeding and roosting and resting areas (particularly at high tide) for a 
wide range of species of waterfowl and are therefore very important supporting habitats for the wintering and 
passage bird features of the SPA and Ramsar Site. The habitats within the pills provide important shelter 
and feeding habitats for both fish and bird species. 
 
The Severn Estuary saltmarshes are generally grazed by sheep and/or cattle.  Grazing is a significant factor 
in determining the plant communities found within them and their value for dependant species such as birds 
and rare plants. 
  
3.4.4  Typical Species 
 
The saltmarsh communities present relate to the four principal zones referred to above.  
 
The  low  to  mid  marsh  communities  include  transitional  low  saltmarsh  with  Puccinellia  maritima,  annual 
Salicornia  sp.  and  Suaeda  maritima;  Aster  tripolium  (rayed)  saltmarsh;  Puccinellia  maritima  saltmarsh; 
Atriplex portulacoides saltmarsh; and Juncus maritimus - Triglochin maritima saltmarsh. 
 
The mid to upper marsh communities include Festuca rubra saltmarsh; Artemisia maritime saltmarsh; and 
Juncus maritimus salt-marsh. 
 
The  transitional  high  marsh  communities  include  Spergularia  marina  -  Puccinellia  distans  saltmarsh; 
Elytrigia  atherica  saltmarsh;  Elytrigia  repens  saltmarsh;  Festuca  rubra  -  Agrostis  stolonifera  -  Potentilla 
anserina  inundation  grassland;  Festuca  arundinacea  coarse  grassland;  Agrostis  stolonifera  -  Alopecurus 
geniculatus  inundation  grassland;  Phragmites  australis  reedbed;  Bolboshoenus  maritimus  swamp;  and 
Agrostis stolonifera sub-community. 
 
The pioneer saltmarsh communities include Spartina anglica saltmarsh; Annual Salicornia saltmarsh; and 
Suaeda maritima saltmarsh. 
 
Several notable species are also present Alopecurus bulbosus, Althaea officinalis, Bupleurum tenuissimum, 
Hordeum marinum, Puccinellia rupestris, Trifolium squamosum, Lepidium latifolium, Allium oleraceum, and 
Petroselinum segetum (Dargie 1998). 
 
3.4.5  Natural Processes 
 
The  location,  character,  and  dynamic  behaviour  of  saltmeadows  are  governed  by  four  physical  factors: 
sediment supply, tidal regime, wind-wave climate and the movement of relative sea level.  There are four 
elements necessary for the development and growth of a salt marsh: (1) a relatively stable area of sediment 
that is covered by the tide for a shorter period than the time it is exposed; (2) a supply of suitable sediment 
available  within  the  period  of  tidal  cover;  (3)  water  velocities  that  are  sufficiently  low  for  some  of  the 
sediment  to  settle  out;  and  (4)  a  supply  of  seeds  or  other  propagules  for  the  establishment  of  vegetation 
cover. 
 
The  topography  and  microtopography  of  areas  of  Atlantic  salt  meadow  are  the  product  of  complex 
interaction  between  hydrodynamic  and  sediment  transport  processes,  sediment  supply  and  coastal 

 

38 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
morphology.   These  can  be  highly  dynamic  and  vary  with  short  and  long-term  natural  cycles,  climate 
influences  and  stochastic  events,  including:  tidal  range  and  excursion,  salinity,  water  temperature  and 
suspended particulate concentrations.   
 
The  marsh-edge  morphology  provides  information  on  the  short  to  medium  term  trends  of  marsh 
morphodynamics.  Accreting and stable seaward marsh edges have an accretional ramp upon which pioneer 
and  low-marsh  vegetation  can  become  established.    Erosional  margins  are  characterised  either  by  the 
presence  of  mud-mound  topography  or  by  marsh-edge  cliffs  fronted  by  toppled  cliff  blocks  with  live  or 
dying  vegetation,  rotational  slide  or  overhanging  (cantilever)  blocks.  Terraced  marsh  margins  indicate 
episodic erosion and accretion on timescales over decades to centuries. 
 
The  Severn  Estuary  saltmarshes  do  not  generally  contain  a  pattern  of  creeks  and  pans  more  typical  of 
extensive saltmarshes in estuaries with less extreme tidal ranges.  Instead the saltmarshes are dissected by   
pills (steep sided natural drainage channels cutting through the saltmarsh) where freshwater streams flow 
into the estuary.  These are often deep and steep sided funnel shaped features, often with pioneer vegetation 
established along their banks although in many cases the natural structure of the pill is truncated by tidal 
flaps or flow valves.  In a few locations natural salt pans occur within the saltmarshes.   
 
Major  erosion  of  saltmarsh  is  indicated  by  internal  dissection  and  enlargement  of  the  drainage  network, 
ultimately leading to the creation of mud basins.  
 
Nutrient levels are a strong influence on the growth of estuarine saltmarsh plants.  Nutrient cycling within 
saltmarshes can also have a significant effect on coastal and estuarine water quality.  In this respect, healthy, 
functional  saltmarsh  habitat  may  have  an  important  role  to  play  in  the  control  of  nutrients,  which  are 
important in determining water quality.   
 
Given favourable conditions, depending on sediment supply and hydrodynamic regime, mudflats evolve into 
saltmarshes  by  way  of  substrate  stabilisation  by  algae,  diatoms  and  early  pioneer  plants,  giving  rise  to 
enhanced sediment accretion rates. 
 
3.5  Reef  

3.5.1  Range 
 
Reefs  are  rocky  marine  habitats  or  biological  concretions  that  rise  from  the  seabed.  They  are  generally 
subtidal but may extend as an unbroken transition into the intertidal zone, where they are exposed to the air 
at low tide.  Intertidal areas are only included within this Annex I type where they are connected to subtidal 
reefs.  Reefs are very variable in form and in the communities that they support.  Two main types of reef can 
be recognised: those where animal and plant communities develop on rock or stable boulders and cobbles, 
and those where structure is created by the animals themselves (biogenic reefs).  

Rocky reefs are extremely variable, both in structure and in the communities they support. A wide range of 
topographical reef forms meet the EU definition of this habitat type. These range from vertical rock walls to 
horizontal  ledges,  sloping  or  flat  bed  rock,  broken  rock,  boulder  fields,  and  aggregations  of  cobbles.  In 
contrast to the variety of rocky reefs, there is somewhat less variation in biogenic reefs, but the associated 
communities can vary according to local conditions of water movement, salinity, depth and turbidity. The 
main species which form biogenic reefs in the UK are blue mussels Mytilus edulis, horse mussels Modiolus 
modiolus, ross worms Sabellaria spp., the serpulid worm Serpula vermicularis, and cold-water corals such as 
Lophelia pertusa. 

 

 

 

 

Reefs occur widely around the UK coast, and are found in both inshore and offshore waters. There is a far 
greater range and extent of rocky reefs than biogenic concretions. Only a few invertebrate species are able to 
develop biogenic reefs, and these have a restricted distribution and extent in the UK. 

The Severn Estuary has areas of biogenic reefs, formed by the tube-dwelling polychaete worm Sabellaria 
alveolata. Sabellaria alveolata reefs in the UK are predominantly an intertidal habitat but the Severn Estuary 

 

39 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
is one of the few places where Sabellaria alveolata reefs occur extensively in the subtidal, as well as the 
intertidal.   
 
3.5.2  Extent and Distribution 

 

 

There are patches of intertidal Sabellaria alveolata reef throughout the Estuary, although it tends to be more 
common on the English side. The subtidal Sabellaria alveolata tends to be in the outer parts of the Estuary, 
southwest of a line between Clevedon and Newport. The exact distribution of subtidal Sabellaria alveolata 
reef in the Severn Estuary is unknown, partly due to the difficulties in sampling this habitat. 

3.5.3  Structure and Function 
 
Sabellaria  alveolata  is  a  species  of  small  worm  which  constructs  tubes  using  sand  particles,  to  build 
honeycomb-like structures. Sabellaria alveolata reefs are often also known as honeycomb worm reefs. 
 
These biogenic reefs tend to increase habitat diversity for other species (Holt et al 1998), sometimes leading 
to  higher  species  diversity  within Sabellaria  reefs  compared  to  the  surrounding  sediment  or  rock habitats 
(Dubois et al 2002).  Sabellaria alveolata reefs cycle through different phases, from newly settled worms 
through vigorous fast growing reef to older, more biodiverse hummocks (Cunningham et al, 1984).  At other 
sites each of these phases tends to have a different community of plants and animals associated with it, so all 
phases are considered important for biodiversity (Collins, 2001; Dubois et al, 2002). 
 
In order to thrive, Sabellaria alveolata requires an abundance of suitable coarse sand to support tube building 
(and  therefore  reef  growth),  as  well  as  the  availability  of  suitable  substrates  (pebbles,  cobbles,  boulders, 
bedrock) to attach to. Larval supply is also important and Sabellaria larvae are thought to stay in the water 
column for one to six months (Jackson 2008). The worms are filter feeders and therefore food within the 
water  column  (suspended  detritus  material)  is  also  needed.  Sabellaria  larvae  are  thought  to  settle 
preferentially in areas where Sabellaria reef has been present in the past (Holt et al, 1998).  
 
3.5.4  Typical Species 
 
The  Sabellaria  alveolata  reef  biotopes  which  have  been  recorded  in  the  Severn  Estuary  are  Sabellaria 
alveolata  on  variable  salinity  sublittoral  mixed  sediment  and  Sabellaria  alveolata  reefs  on  sand-abraded 
eulittoral rock. 
 
In  the  Severn  Estuary  (both  subtidal  and  intertidal)  the  presence  of  Sabellaria  alveolata  reefs  generally 
increases species diversity, relative to the surrounding rock or sediment, although the diversity of Sabellaria 
alveolata reefs in the Severn is still thought to be comparatively low compared to other areas of the UK.  
Species commonly found associated with subtidal Sabellaria alveolata reef from infaunal samples include 
Eulalia  tripunctata,  Mediomastus  fragilis,  Typosyllis  armillaris,  Melinna  cristata,  Harpinia  pectinata, 
Ampharete grubei, Golfingia vulgaris, Pygospio elegans, Arenicola marina, Autolytus sp, Sphenia binghami 
and Harmothoe impar (Mettam et al. 1994 and Marine Recorder database). 
Species found in intertidal Sabellaria alveolata reefs in the Severn Estuary at Goldcliff and Lavernock point 
include Crangon crangon, Actinia equina, Cancer pagarus, Porcellana platycheles, Littorina spp., Pholas 
dactylus,  Elminius  modestus,  Fucus  serratus,  Corralina  officinalis  and  Enteromorpha  spp.(ORiordan, 
2006). 
 
3.5.5  Natural Processes 
 
Little  is  known  about  the  nature  of  the  Sabellaria  alveolata  reef  in  the  Severn  Estuary,  especially  in  the 
subtidal. However, at other sites Sabellaria alveolata is known to have a very variable recruitment and the 
cover in any one area may vary greatly over a number of years (Wilson, 1974).  A typical life span of 4-5 
years for worms in colonies forming reefs on bedrock and large boulders has been reported from other areas 
(Wilson,  1971),  with  a  likely  maximum  of  around  9  years  (Gruet,  1982;  Wilson,  1971).  However,  it  is 
suspected that there are many colonies on intertidal cobble and small boulder scars on moderately exposed 
shores where shorter lifespans are likely due to the unstable nature of the substratum (Holt et al, 1998). As

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
mentioned  above,  Sabellaria  alveolata  reefs  cycle  through  several  different  phases,  all  of  which  are 
considered important for biodiversity. 
 
 
3.6  Other  estuarine  habitats  :  Hard  substrate  habitats  (rocky  shores)  and  eel 

grass beds 

 
3.6.1  Extent and Distribution 
 
There is approximately 1,500 ha of hard substrate habitat within the Severn Estuary, consisting of boulders, 
rock, mussel/cobble scars, rocky pools and shingle (Countryside Council for Wales, 2006; English Nature, 
2006).  The  largest  areas  of  hard  substrate    are  located  towards  the  outer  estuary  at  Brean  Down,  Anchor 
Head  and Sand Point together with rocky platforms and cliffs at Clevedon and Portishead.  There are also 
extensive rock platforms at English stones, Aust and Beachley.  
 
Beds  of  eelgrass    (Zostera    spp.),  the  largest  in  Wales,  occur  on  some  of  the  more  sheltered  mixed  hard 
substrate areas around the Welsh side of the Second Severn Crossing.   
 
3.6.2  Structure and Function 
 
Hard substrate habitats in the Severn Estuary display different characteristics to other areas in Wales. Where 
there is bedrock, fucoid algae cover is dense but with little associated flora and fauna. Areas of soft clay rock 
around  Penarth  also  support  the  boring  bivalves  Barnea  candida  and  Pholas  datylus.  Pebble  and  cobble 
shores  tend  to  be  dominated  by  barnacles  mostly  Elminius  modestus,  and  sparse  rough  periwinkles  and 
winkles.  In  the  sublittoral  fringe  on  bedrock,  cobbles  and  pebbles,  hydroids,  bryozoans,  sponges  and 
barnacles  dominate.    These  species  form  communities  that  are  usually  associated  with  subtidal  habitats 
(adapted from Brazier et al 2007).  
 
These habitats provide a wide range of services for estuarine species. They are important components of the 
SAC Estuary feature, important supporting habitats for the wintering and passage bird features of the SPA 
and  Ramsar  Site  and  also  important  supporting  habitats  for  the  fish  assemblage  of  the  SAC  and  Ramsar 
designations. 
 
Seagrass beds are one of the most productive habitats of shallow water coastal ecosystems supporting large 
numbers of algae, invertebrates and fish and are an important food source for several species of ducks and 
geese including wigeon and European white-fronted geese. The Zostera beds in the Severn are unusual in 
that they occur in an area of mixed cobbles, sand and mud with large boulders, in other parts of Wales they 
are associated with mudflats. Both species of Zostera occur within the bed. On more dry elevated areas of 
sediment  Zostera  noltii  can  be  found,  whereas  wet  depressions  and  channels  are  dominated  by  Zostera 
marina.  Zostera  coverage  can  be  patchy  but  locally  abundant.  Hard  substrata  within  the  Zostera  bed  is 
dominated by fucoid algae, ephemeral green algae and barnacles.  
 
3.6.3  Typical Species 
 
Typical fauna and flora of rocky and mixed shore areas of the Severn include spiral wrack, bladder wrack, 
eggwrack and serrated wrack, periwinkles, limpets, barnacles and whelks. On lower shore rock, cobbles and 
pebbles  barnacles  dominate  including  the  barnacle  Balanus crenatus  and  hydroids Tubularia indivisa and 
Sertularia cupressina the bryozoan Alcyonidium diaphanum and mermaids glove sponge Haliclona oculata . 
 
Both  species  of  eelgrass,  Zostera  marina,  and  Z.  noltii  have  been  recorded  in  the  estuary.    These  are  of 
restricted distribution in British estuaries.  It is unusual to have both species in one location.

Introduction 

 
3.6.4  Natural Processes 
 
The extent and distribution of the rocky shore habitat is largely determined by the underlying geology and 
sedimentology, along with orientation and aspect and the influence of the prevailing physical conditions such 
as the degree of exposure to wave action and tidal currents.  These factors, combined with the influence of 
others,  such  as  water  quality  (including  turbidity)  and  sediment  chemistry,  influence  the  assemblages  of 
marine species associated with the different rocky habitats throughout the estuary.  
 
Seagrass beds typically occur in sheltered environments such as shallow inlets and are usually found on soft 
sediments. The Zostera beds in the Severn are unusual in that they occur  in an area of mixed cobbles gravel 
sand and mud. 
 
 
3.7  Fish  
 
3.7.1 
 
The  fish  fauna  of  the  Severn  Estuary  is  very  diverse  (Potts  &  Swaby  1994,  Bird  2008).    More  than  110 
species of fish have been identified including a wide range of migratory species and estuarine specialists and 
some more typically marine and freshwater species reflecting the influence of the wider Bristol Channel and 
major rivers entering the estuary (Severn, Wye, Usk, Avon Parrett).   
 
3.7.2  Fish features of the Severn Estuary European Marine Site 
 
The Severn Estuary is of particular importance for migratory fish.  The estuary is one of the most important 
British estuaries for three rare species - river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis, sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus 
and twaite shad Alosa fallax which are designated features of the SAC.  These species together with salmon 
Salmo salar, sea trout Salmo trutta, eel Anguilla anguilla and allis shad Alosa alosa are also a designated 
feature of the Ramsar Site. 
 
The  wider  assemblage  of  fish  species,  which  includes  the  migratory  species,  estuarine  specialists  and  the 
more typically marine and freshwater species, is a designated feature of the Ramsar Site and a component of 
the estuary feature of the SAC. 
 
3.7.3  Supporting habitats 
 
The  estuary  habitats,  tidal  stretches  of  the  feeding  rivers  and  saltmarsh  morphological  features  such  as 
drainage  channels,  known  locally  as  pills  and  rhines  (reens  in  Wales)  provide  important  feeding, 
breeding and sheltered nursery areas for a wide range of fish. 
 
3.7.4  Migratory fish 
 
The  river  and  sea  lamprey  are  a  primitive  type  of  fish  having  a  distinctive  suckered  mouth  but  no  jaws.  
Although numbers of lamprey have declined over the last 100 years, the UK is still one of their strongholds.  
Sea and river lampreys spend their adult life in the sea or estuaries but spawn and spend the juvenile phase in 
rivers.  They use the Severn Estuary as a migratory passage to and from their spawning and nursery grounds 
in the rivers.   
 
Allis and twaite shad are the only two members of the herring family found in fresh water in the UK.  Both 
look like large herring and were formerly eaten in this country before numbers declined and the fisheries 
collapsed.    In  the  middle  of  the  19th  Century,  the  value  of  shad  rivalled  that  of  salmon,  and  in  the  River 
Severn, shad made up about one-third of all catches.  Three of the four confirmed UK spawning populations 
of twaite shad are in the rivers Severn, Usk and Wye respectively. The major part of the spawning population 
of Twaite shad consists of fish that have spawned and passed up and down through the estuary more than 
once.  The  shad  enter  estuaries  in  spring  and  move  up  into  the  rivers  to  spawn.  The  estuary  serves  as  a 
nursery area for juvenile shad where they feed on plankton.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
The  Severn  Estuary  supports  an  important  run  of migratory  salmon  and  sea  trout  which pass  through  the 
estuary on their way to and from their spawning grounds in the upper reaches of the rivers and the open sea.  
The Severn Estuary has the largest eel run in Great Britain.  
 
3.7.5  Assemblage of fish species 
 
The assemblage of fish species includes the migratory species (referred to in section 3.8.4 above), as well as 
the following: 
 

  Estuarine species 

  Marine species 

  Freshwater species 

o  Species typically occurring and breeding in estuaries (Bird, 2008) 
o  Marine species occurring in large numbers in estuaries (Bird, 2008) 
o  Predominantly marine species occurring infrequently in the Severn (Bird, 2008) 
o  Species typically occurring and breeding in freshwater and recorded within the Severn cSAC 

(Bird, 2008) 

 
 
Estuarine species 
 
These species of fish rely on the estuary for some aspect of their life-cycle. As a result of this dependence, 
these species are often the most vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental factors that could affect the 
habitat  and  ecology  of  the  estuary.  Marine  species  occurring  in  large  numbers  in  estuaries  are  all  marine 
species who spend the first few years of life in the sheltered waters of the estuary where suitable food is 
abundant and there are fewer predators. The Severn Estuary ranks as one of the top ten estuaries in the UK 
for  the  number  of  marine  estuarine-opportunistic  species  it  supports  (Potts  &  Swaby  1993).  Marine 
estuarine-opportunists can be present in the estuary in very large numbers at particular times of year. These 
include sprat, herring, whiting, bib, poor cod, bass and common goby (Bird, 2008). 
There are a few species that spend their entire life-cycle within the estuary. These include common goby, 
black goby, sand smolt and 3- spined stickleback (Bird, 2008). 
Marine species 
 
These fish normally spend their entire life-cycle in the sea and only occasionally enter estuaries. Therefore, 
they  have  only  a  minor  role  to  play  in  the  estuarine  ecosystem.  Thus,  only  four  species,  the  conger  eel, 
Norway pout, red mullet and plaice; are ever caught in numbers exceeding about 10 per year in power station 
samples. They probably have little impact, either as prey or as predators on other estuarine species. While 
they add to the biodiversity of the fish assemblage, their main populations occur in the sea. (Bird, 2008) 
 
Freshwater species 
 
These species typically occur and breed in freshwater, but have occasionally been recorded within the Severn 
Estuary. The specimens recovered at Oldbury and/or Berkeley power stations are presumably fish that have 
inadvertently  been  swept  downstream  and  entered  brackish  water.  They  include  perch,  three-spined 
stickleback, tench, roach and chub. The numbers of freshwater species recovered at Oldbury is always low, 
and usually related to increases in fresh water discharge in the spring and autumn months after heavy rain. 
The only exception to this generalisation concerns the three-spined stickleback which occurs in considerable 
numbers at Oldbury and can be regarded as both a freshwater and an estuarine species (Bird, 2008)

3.8  Birds 

 
3.8.1 
 

Introduction 

Many estuaries in the UK are of great importance to migratory and wintering wildfowl and waders.  The 
Severn  Estuary  forms  part  of  the  complex  chain  of  estuary  sites  along  the  western  coast  of  the  UK  that 
provide  habitats  for  migratory  waterfowl.    The  relatively  mild  winter  weather  conditions  found  here 
compared  to  continental  Europe  at  similar  latitudes  can  be  of  additional  importance  to  the  survival  of 
wintering  waterfowl  during  periods  of  severe  weather.    It  is  especially  important  when  there  is  severe 
weather affecting other sites further north and on the east coast of Britain.   
 
The Severn Estuary ranks amongst the top ten British estuaries for the size of visiting waterfowl populations 
that it supports over winter (Musgrove et. al., 2001).  Outside of this period, it is of particular importance as 
a staging area in autumn and spring for migratory waterfowl species as it lies on the East Atlantic Flyway 
route.  Bird communities are highly mobile and exhibit patterns of activity related to tidal water movements 
and  many  other  factors.  Different  bird  species  exploit  different  parts  of  a  marine  area  and  different  prey 
species. 
 
3.8.2  Bird features of the Severn Estuary European Marine Site 

The migratory wintering and passage populations of birds in the Severn Estuary are designated  features of 
the  SPA  (see  section  2.2)  and  Ramsar  Site  (see  section  2.3)  which  supports  in  excess  of  70,000  birds  in 
winter.  These include internationally and nationally important populations of key bird species in winter for 
which the UK has particular importance in both Europe and the world. The bird assemblage is also part of 
the Estuaries feature of the SAC. 
 
3.8.3  Low-tide distribution of waterbirds on the Severn Estuary SPA and Ramsar Site 

 

 

Natural England and the CCW commissioned the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) to organise , as part of 
the series of WeBS Low Tide Counts, a complete low tide survey of the Severn Estuary during the winter of 
2002/03 (Burton et al., 2003).  The mean numbers and distribution of total waterbird species recorded on 
each count section on the Severn Estuary in the winters 1987/88 to 1991/92 and in 2002/03 from this BTO 
low-tide  count  data  for  various  individual  species  and  the  bird  assemblage  are  illustrated  in  Appendix  9.   
The  Figures  generally  indicate  that  the  waterfowl  are  distributed  extensively  across  virtually  the  entire 
intertidal area with some obviously high concentrations in specific areas.   
 
These  maps  are  indicative  only  and  several  constraints  on  their  use  should  be  noted  when  attempting  to 
interpret them. Firstly, it should be noted that in each winter only a maximum of four counts were made of 
each count section, one a month from November to February.  Observation of the central areas of the estuary 
is also very difficult with all observations being made from land and it is possible that the numbers of birds 
using these areas were underestimated.  Gulls were only recorded in the 2002/03 survey.  However, even in 
that  survey, coverage  of  these  species  was  patchy.    The  Severn  is  a  highly  dynamic  estuary  and  thus  the 
location and extent of many of the intertidal areas may have changed since the Ordnance Survey maps used 
for this project were created.  The movements of sediments may potentially also cause marked differences in 
the distributions of invertebrates and thus waterbirds between years.  It should also be noted that the numbers 
of birds recorded on the Severn Estuary may vary annually due to weather conditions.  In cold winters, the 
west coast of Britain may act as a refuge for many waterbirds that in milder winters would occur on the east 
coast or on the Continent.  In cold winters, therefore, waterbirds may be more widely distributed across the 
estuary  than  they  would  in  milder  winters.    Lastly,  in  assessing  the  importance  of  different  intertidal 
mudflats, it is also essential to note that some species may use different areas during the night to those where 
they are recorded in the day. 
 
3.8.4  Relationship between bird populations and supporting habitats 

In  recognition  of  the  fact  that  bird  populations  on  a  site  may  change  in  response  to  wider  national  or 
international trends or events, this Regulation 33 advice addresses the habitat conditions on the site necessary 
to  support  the  bird  populations,  as  well  as  the  bird  populations  themselves.  Supporting  habitats  are 

 

44 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
identified which describe the key habitats within the European Marine Site necessary to support the interest 
features i.e. the qualifying bird species (see Table 3 for the SPA and Tables 5 and 7 for the Ramsar Site. The 
Favourable Condition Tables  (section 4.2; Table 15 for the SPA and Section 4.3 Table 20 for the Ramsar 
Site) contain further details on habitat conditions.    
 
The key supporting habitats are the intertidal mudflats and sandflats, saltmarshes and hard substrate habitats 
(rocky shores).  Reference should also be made to sections  of this document that relate to the Severn Estuary 
SAC interest features which provides advice in respect of these habitats (section 4.1 and Tables 8, 10 and 
11). 
 
Bird communities are highly mobile and exhibit patterns of activity related to tidal water movements and 
many other factors. Different bird species exploit different parts of a marine area and different prey species. 
Changes in the habitat may therefore affect them differently. The most important factors related to this are: 
 
 

current extent and distribution of suitable feeding and roosting habitat (eg saltmarsh,  mudflats, shingle 
and rocky shores); 
sufficient prey availability (eg crustaceans, small fish, molluscs, worms and seeds); 
levels of disturbance maintained at or below levels necessary to provide favourable conditions for  birds 
feeding and roosting areas;  

 
 

  water quality necessary to maintain intertidal plant and animal communities; and 
 

fresh  water  quantity,  tidal  flows,  salinity  gradients  and  grazing  necessary  to  maintain  saltmarsh 
conditions suitable for bird feeding and roosting. 

 
There are also a number of habitats, such as the wet coastal grazing marsh, improved  grassland and open 
standing waters that support the qualifying bird species and occur within the SPA and Ramsar Site boundary.  
However,  these  habitats  lie  above  highest  astronomical  tide  and  therefore  are  not  within  the  European 
Marine Site.  Objectives to maintain these aspects of bird interest in favourable condition are found within 
Natural England and CCWs conservation objectives for the relevant SSSI within the SPA and Ramsar site 
boundary and will be dealt with through relevant procedures outlined in the Conservation (Natural Habitats 
&c.) Regulations 1994.   
 
Some  species  will  also  use  areas  of  land  and  coastal  waters  outside  the  boundaries  of  both  the  European 
Marine Site, SPA and Ramsar Site.  Relevant authorities need to have regard to such adjacent interests, as 
they might be affected by activities taking place within, or adjacent to the European Marine Site. 
 
3.8.5  Bird count data and assessing condition of bird features and their habitats 
 
Natural  England  and  CCWs  conservation  objectives  at  the  site  level  focus  on  maintaining  both  the 
populations of the qualifying species and the habitats used by them. Site management should therefore aim to 
avoid both damage to the supporting habitats and disturbance to the birds. In reporting on the conservation 
status, account will need to be taken of both habitat conditions and the status of the bird populations. 
 
Accordingly, Natural England and CCW will use annual counts, in the context of five year peak means for 
qualifying  species,  together  with  available  information  on  population  and  distribution  trends,  to  assess 
whether an SPA is continuing to make an appropriate contribution to the Favourable Conservation Status of 
the species.  Count information will be assessed in combination with information on habitat condition, at the 
appropriate time within the reporting cycle, in order to report to the European Union. 
 
In  addition  to  focusing  on  avoiding  deterioration  to  the  habitats  of  the  qualifying  species,  the  Habitats 
Directive also requires that actions be taken to avoid significant disturbance to the species for which the site 
was designated. Such disturbance may result in alterations in population trends and/or distribution patterns. 
Avoiding disturbance to species requirements is mentioned in the favourable condition table accompanying 
the conservation objectives for the SPA and Ramsar Site (Tables 16 and 21).  In this context, five-year peak 
mean information on populations will be used as the basis for assessing whether disturbance is damaging. 

 

 

45 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Attention is also directed to the inclusion of disturbance in the advice on operations provided in Section 5.  
Where disturbance is highlighted in such advice, relevant authorities need to avoid damaging disturbance to 
qualifying species when exercising their functions under the Directive. 
 
 
3.8.6  Description of the Severn Estuary bird features and their supporting habitats 

 

3.8.6.1  Internationally important populations of waterfowl 

This comprises:  
 
A.  Internationally important populations of regularly occurring Annex 1 species : Bewicks Swan 
B.  Internationally important populations of regularly occurring migratory species of the SPA 
C.   Internationally important populations of waterfowl of the Ramsar Site 
 

A. 

Annex 1 species of the SPA  

Description of the Feature 

The species listed in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive are the subject of special conservation measures 
concerning  their  habitat  in  order  to  ensure  their  survival  and  reproduction  in  their  area  of 
distribution.  Species  listed  on  Annex  1  are  in  danger  of  extinction,  rare  or  vulnerable.  Annex  1 
species that regularly occur at levels over 1% of the national population meet the SPA qualifying 
criteria.    The  Severn  Estuary  SPA  supports  internationally  important  populations  of  one  Annex  I 
species  
 
 

Bewicks swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii  
(Note : this species is also part of C. internationally important populations of waterfowl of 
the Ramsar Site)  

Key supporting habitats for Bewicks swan 

Intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  -  The  focal  area  for  the  Bewicks  swans  is  the  upper  Severn 
Estuary in the vicinity of the New Grounds, Slimbridge area.  The mudflats and sandflats exposed as 
the tide falls where the estuary widens in the upper reaches of the site at Waveridge Sands, Frampton 
Sands and The Noose are used as a safe refuge areas when the birds are disturbed.  

Saltmarsh  communities  -  The  birds  feed  on  the  saltmarsh  and  the  transition  from  saltmarsh  to 
coastal grazing marsh in front of the sea defences in the upper estuary at The Dumbles, where areas 
of the high marsh are mainly affected only by brackish water during tidal inundation.  They favour 
areas that have unrestricted views for the early detection of predators. 

Bewicks  swan  graze  on  a  range  of  soft  meadow  grasses  such  as  Agrostis  stolonifera  and 
Alopecurus  geniculatus  found  in  wet  meadows  which  are  outwith  the  European  Marine  Site 
boundary.

Internationally important populations of regularly occurring migratory species of the SPA and 
Internationally important populations of waterfowl of the Ramsar Site 

Description of the features 

Migratory species that regularly occur at levels of 1% or more of the total biogeographic population 
meet the SPA criteria and qualify for designation in their own right.   
 
Wintering species that regularly occur at levels of 1% or more of the total biogeographic population 
meet the Ramsar criteria (3c) and qualify for designation in their own right. 
 
The following qualifying species of both the SPA and Ramsar are: 

  European white-fronted goose Anser albifrons  
  Dunlin Calidris alpina alpina 
  Redshank Tringa totanus totanus   
  Shelduck Tadorna tadorna 
  Gadwall Anas strepera  

 

Note : previous Regulation 33 advice issued in respect of the Severn Estuary SPA in February 2005 
excluded  gadwall  as  they  were  considered  not  to  make  use  of  the  European  Marine  Site  to  any 
significant  degree  but  further  recent  evidence  (2000/01  Low  Tide  Bird  Counts)  has  demonstrated 
that this species  does make use of the EMS and has consequently now been included. 

Key supporting habitats  

Intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  -  The  extensive  mudflats  and  sandflats  of  the  Severn  Estuary 
provide undisturbed refuge and a rich resource of intertidal invertebrates as food for many species of 
migratory  birds.    The  Severn  supports  massive  populations  of  birds,  many  of  which  are  highly 
mobile, feeding and roosting in different areas, depending on food availability and the state of the 
tide. 

The European white-fronted geese roost at night on estuarine sandbanks and usually fly less than 
10km  to  the  daytime  feeding  grounds.    Therefore  conservation  of  traditional  roosting  sites  is 
necessary to enable the population to exploit potential feeding habitats.  The sandbanks adjacent to 
the New Grounds at Slimbridge are a long established, traditional wintering area for the European 
white-fronted geese (Owen et al., 1986) where they use Waveridge Sand, Frampton Sand and the 
Noose.  Only occasionally will small numbers occur at other localities within the Severn Estuary.  
Shelduck  exploit  the  rich  resources  of  invertebrates  found  in  the  intertidal  mudflats  where  they 
forage  for  molluscs  and  other  invertebrates  such  as  the  mudsnail    Hydrobia  spp,  mussels  Mytilus 
edulis and small crustaceans such as the common shore crab Carcinus maenas.  They feed in groups, 
and are distributed widely throughout the estuary where there are extensive areas of intertidal flats, 
but there are major concentrations on Bridgwater Bay, around the mouth of the Rhymney river and, 
prior to construction of the Cardiff Barrage, in Cardiff Bay (Ferns, 1980a; Fox & Salmon, 1988a; 
Clarke, 1989; WWT Wetlands Advisory Service, April 2003).  Bridgwater Bay is a long established 
traditional moulting area for shelduck during late summer and autumn (Eltringham & Boyd, 1960, 
1963; Morley, 1966; Fox & Salmon, 1988a).  It is the largest single moulting area in Europe away 
from Waddensea.    

Redshank and dunlin are distributed widely and feed throughout the estuary on marine polychaete 
worms, crustaceans and molluscs such as the Baltic tellin Macoma balthica.  They frequently feed 
along  undisturbed  strandlines  throughout  the  estuary.    They  favour  areas  that  have  abundant 
invertebrate prey species and unrestricted views for the early detection of predators.  The location of

feeding birds on the intertidal flats is a reflection of the invertebrate species found there which, in 
turn, are dependent on the sediment type.  Dunlin and redshank mainly feed on invertebrates in the 
muddier  finer  sediments.    Dunlin  are  found  mostly  on  the  mid  shore  whereas  redshank  are  more 
thinly distributed and are often found in smaller groups in the creeks and sub-estuaries. The Severn 
has the third largest wintering population of Dunlin in Britain. Feeding flocks are widely distributed 
around the estuary particularly downstream of the first Severn Bridge, with particular concentrations 
at  Rhymney/Peterstone,  Uskmouth,  Welsh  Grounds,  Undy,  Clevedon  and  Bridgwater  Bay  (Ferns, 
1977; Mudge, 1979; Ferns, 1980a; Clark, 1989).  There are notable concentrations of redshank at the 
mouths  of  the  Rhymney,  Wye,  Avon  and  Parrett  rivers  (Ferns,  1977,  1980a;  Clark,  1989;  WWT 
Wetlands Advisory Service, April 2003). 

Gadwall are predominantly a frewshwater species preferring the wetland habitats tht occur within the 
SPA behind the flood defences and therefore outside the European Marine Site- most notably the 
freshwater wetlands at Slimbridge and Bridgwater bay. However, they do make use of the estuary 
but this is largely restricted to areas where freshwater flows come into the estuary, particularly larger 
pills and rivers- most notably at Avonmouth, between the two Severn Bridges and at Woodspring 
and Weston Bays.  

Saltmarsh  -  Upper  and  lower  saltmarsh  provide  important  feeding  and  roosting  areas  for  the 
internationally  important  migratory  birds  throughout  the  estuary.  The  saltmarshes  provide  a  rich 
feeding habitat for redshank and shelduck, which feed on invertebrate species in the sediments, such 
as the mudsnail Hydrobia.  The European white-fronted geese graze on a range of saltmarsh grasses 
and herbs such as common saltmarsh grass Puccinellia maritima and sea barley Hordeum marinum.  
The  birds  feed  on  the  saltmarsh  and  the  transition  to  coastal  grazing  marsh  in  front  of  the  sea 
defences in the upper estuary and particularly at the The Dumbles.   

The saltmarshes also have an important function providing a safe haven from the tides that flood the 
mudflats  twice  a  day.    The  low-growing  dense  vegetation  provides  a  suitable  roosting  habitat  for 
redshank and dunlin, which prefer to roost on areas of short vegetation ensuring good visibility.  The 
saltmarshes throughout the estuary provide an important communal roosting site for redshank, dunlin 
and  shelduck.  Upper  saltmarsh  in  particular  makes  ideal  highwater  roost  sites  and  there  are  main 
high  tide  roosts  in  some  areas  with  little  human  disturbance  where  waders  congregate  from  their 
feeding areas.   

Hard substrate habitats (rocky shores) - the shingle and rocks in the estuary provide feeding areas 
for dunlin and redshank and some limited foraging at high tide.  It is also  provides important roost 
sites at high tide particularly for the dunlin and redshank.  Many of the rocks are off shore and are 
therefore generally free from human disturbance.  These include Guscar Rocks in the upper reaches, 
Blackstone Rocks at Clevedon and Stert Island in Bridgwater Bay.   

Freshwater  coastal  grazing  marsh,  improved    grassland  and  open  standing  waters    these 
supporting  habitats  lie  outside  the  European  Marine  Site  boundary  but  within  the  SPA.    They 
provide key areas for feeding and roosting for all the migratory species particularly at high tide, and 
mainly on the English side of the Estuary. 

 
3.8.6.2  Internationally important assemblage of waterfowl 

Description of the feature 

In  addition  to  supporting  internationally  important  populations  of  individual  birds,  the  Severn 
Estuary  also  qualifies  under  Article  4.2  as  a  wetland  of  international  importance  by  regularly 
supporting over 20,000 waterfowl (Cranswick et al., 1999, JNCC website).  A peak count of over 
100,000  waterfowl  was  recorded  in  the  winter  season  of  1992-93  (Waters  et  al.,  1993).    The 
wintering  waterfowl  assemblage  (consisting  of over  68,000 birds)  includes  all  regularly  occurring 
waterfowl.  

48 

 

 

 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Species that qualify as a listed component of the assemblage include all the birds covered by section 
3.8.6.1 and species present in nationally important numbers.  
 
These species are: 
  Dunlin (migratory passage populations) 
  Redshank (migratory passage populations) 
  Wigeon  
  Teal  
  Pintail  
  Pochard  
  Tufted duck  
  Ringed plover  
  Grey plover  
  Curlew  
  Whimbrel  
  Spotted redshank   

The JNCC website also lists lapwing, mallard and shoveler as qualifying for future inclusion as part 
of this assemblage (Stroud, DA, et al., 2001. The UK SPA network: its scope and content. JNCC, 
Peterborough) 
 
Key supporting habitats for the waterfowl assemblage 

Since a number of species comprising the waterfowl assemblage are qualifying species in their own 
right, their habitat requirements are described in sections 3.4 and 3.5 above. This section therefore 
mainly deals with the habitat requirements of the other assemblage species which form part of the 
waterfowl assemblage. 

Intertidal mudflats and sandflats - Many of the bird species found within the Severn Estuary are 
highly mobile, feeding and roosting in different areas, depending on food availability, weather and 
tides.    They  favour  areas  that  have  abundant  prey  species  and  unrestricted  views  for  the  early 
detection of predators. Some species of wader such as ringed plover and turnstone will feed on the 
rich invertebrate fauna associated with rotting seaweed occurring along undisturbed strandlines.  

Pintail and Teal are widely distributed around the estuary with a notable concentration at the New 
Grounds.    Pintail  are  also  found  at  Peterstone/Rhymney.    Pochard  and  tufted  duck  have  a  highly 
clumped daytime distribution mainly at New Grounds with most others at Peterstone and the mouth 
of  the  Rhymney.    Large  numbers  of  pochard  move  onto  the  estuary  in  periods  of  sustained  cold 
weather.  There is a large number of wintering ringed plover on the estuary and these numbers swell 
during the spring and autumn when there is a considerable passage of migrants through the Severn 
Estuary.  There are major concentrations of curlew on the flats above the first Severn Bridge as well 
as Bridgwater Bay and the Welsh Grounds.  The Severn Estuary is a particularly important staging 
post for whimbrel during autumn and spring passage periods where some birds feed on the mudflats.  
Spotted redshank are occasionally found on the Axe and Yeo estuaries. 

Saltmarsh  -  Upper  and  lower  saltmarsh  provide  important  feeding  and  roosting  areas  for  the 
internationally  important  assemblage  of  waterfowl  throughout  the  estuary.    The  European  white-
fronted geese graze on a range of saltmarsh grasses and herbs.  The birds feed on the saltmarsh and 
the transition to coastal grazing marsh in front of the sea defences in the upper estuary. 

There are areas of well grazed saltmarsh with saltpans at the River Axe and in the upper reaches of 
the estuary, which are used by wigeon and other wildfowl.  Pools in the higher marsh at Bridgwater 
Bay  and  in  the  saltmarsh  above  the  Severn  bridges  are  also  attractive  to  waders  and  wildfowl, 
providing invertebrates and shelter.  In the winter, ducks such as teal and pintail feed on seeds of 
saltmarsh plants such as Salicornia sp. and Atriplex sp.  Probing waders such as curlew also feed on 
the saltmarsh.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

The saltmarsh provides a safe haven for the feeding waders and wildfowl from the tides that flood 
the mudflats twice a day.  Upper saltmarsh in particular makes ideal high water roost sites and there 
are main high tide roosts in some areas with little human disturbance where waders congregate from 
their feeding areas.  Waders in particular, require very short vegetation to afford unrestricted views 
for the early detection of predators.   

Hard  substrate  habitats  (rocky  shores)  -  The  shingle  and  rocks  in  the  estuary  provide  feeding 
areas for many wildfowl and waders and important roost sites at high tide.  Many of the rocks are off 
shore and are therefore generally free from human disturbance.  These include Guscar Rocks in the 
upper reaches, Blackstone Rocks at Clevedon and Stert Island in Bridgwater Bay. Whimbrel have 
major night roosts at Collister Pill and Stert Island and the Stert Island roost is the largest of its kind 
in  Britain.      Spotted  redshank  are  also  found  around  Stert  Island.    Some  areas  of  hard  substrate 
support  eelgrass  beds  which  provide  a  food  source  for  grazing  wildfowl  species  particularly 
European white-fronted goose and wigeon. 

Freshwater  coastal  grazing  marsh,  improved    grassland  and  open  standing  waters    these 
supporting  habitats  lie  outside  the  European  Marine  Site  boundary  but  within  the  SPA.    They 
provide key areas for breeding, feeding and roosting for all the assemblage species particularly at 
high tide.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Dynamic  physical  process  within  estuaries  can  stem  from  variable  weather  conditions  including  one  off 
storm events, and result in changes in wave exposure, riverine floods or tidal surges. These events can move 
large  quantities  of  sediments  and  alter  channel  morphology,  which  affect  current  patterns  and  sediment 
transport within the estuary.  
 
Where  these  processes  occur  without  significant  anthropogenic  influence  they  fall  under  the  umbrella  of 
natural change. Because estuaries are dynamic systems we can expect the amount and gross distribution of 
habitats  to  change  in  the  future.  In  general  estuarine  communities  and  their  supporting  habitats  are 
intrinsically  more  dynamic  over  short  timescales  when  compared  to  other  marine  and  terrestrial  habitats. 
Some  estuarine  communities  occur  in  cycles  dependent  upon  the  prevailing  physical  conditions.  Features 
should not necessarily be considered in unfavourable condition caused by to the short term disappearance of 
a particular community due to natural processes. 
 
An important example of natural processes occurring over a longer timescale is that estuaries have a natural 
tendency to accumulate sediment, thereby changing their form from their original glacial morphology to a 
state  where  tidal  energy  is  dissipated  by  sediment  banks  and  other  features  such  as  saltmarsh.  This,  with 
other forces of natural change, will therefore cause the width and depth of the estuary to change over time, 
moving towards a state of dynamic equilibrium or most probable state. As part of this process, the location 
and  extent  of  saltmarshes  and  mudflats  may  change,  provided  there  is  capacity  to  accommodate 
readjustment.  Future  developments  should  aim  to  avoid  impact  on  the  future  evolution  of  the  system  as 
where this process is constrained by human influence, the capacity of habitats to accommodate readjustment 
may be affected. 
 
2 Extent of the estuary 
 
The landward limit of the estuary feature is the limit of highest astronomical tide or the site boundary where 
it is below highest astronomical tide, except where the landward limit is defined as straight lines across the 
mouths of rivers entering the estuary. The seaward limit is as shown in the map in Appendix 2. Where other 
Habitats Directive Annex I habitat types occur within the estuary, they also form part of the estuary feature. 
In addition, there are areas of the estuary which do not form part of other Annex I habitat types. 
 
3 Sediment budget 
 
The sediment budget refers to the total amount of sediment within the Severn Estuary taking into account the 
balance of sediment inputs and outputs.  
 
4 Spatial distribution 
 
Spatial distribution of estuarine communities refers to the macro spatial pattern in which communities are 
distributed around the estuary.  This statement does not require micro-distribution of communities e.g. the 
exact mapped positions of specific communities to be maintained.

6 Maintained 
 
Since the late 1990s Natural Englands condition assessment has identified that parts of the saltmarsh within 
the Severn Estuary appear to be exhibiting the effects of coastal squeeze.  For this reason NE and CCW do 
not consider it sufficient simply to seek to maintain the existing saltmarsh resource, rather it is our advice 
that  measures will be required which seek to recreate the approximate extent of saltmarsh habitat present 
within the estuary in 1995 (the year the Severn Estuary was first identified as a proposed SAC); whilst at all 
times working within the framework of seeking a sustainable estuary form.  N.B. This is based upon a site 
specific consideration of the state of habitats within the Severn Estuary, and should not be extended to other 
sites on the basis of this advice.

4.1.2  SAC  interest  feature  2:  Subtidal  sandbanks  which  are  covered  by  sea 

water all the time (subtidal sandbanks) 

 
 
The  conservation  objective  for  the  subtidal  sandbanks  feature  of  the  Severn  Estuary  SAC  is  to 
maintain the feature in favourable condition, as defined below: 
 
The feature will be considered to be in favourable condition when, subject to natural processes1, each of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
i. 
 
ii. 

the  extent  and  distribution3  of  the  individual  subtidal  sandbank  communities4  within  the  site  is 
maintained; 

the total extent of the subtidal sandbanks2 within the site is maintained; 

 
iii. 
 
iv.

Marine Site.

The meaning of natural processes is explained in section 4.1.1.1 
 
2 Extent of subtidal sandbanks 
 
The  subtidal  sandbanks  in  the  Severn  Estuary  change  their  shape  over  time  and  many  are  ephemeral  in 
nature,  although  some  are  relatively  stable  and  long  established.  The  extent  of  the  Annex  1  habitat  is 
considered  to  include  both  the  actual  sandbanks  and  their  associated  sediments.  Areas  of  associated 
sediments have been defined by using the sediment environments of the Bristol Channel Marine Aggregates 
Resources  and  Constraints  project,  commissioned  by  the National  Assembly  for  Wales  (Posford  Duvivier 
and  ABP,  2000)  Associated  sediments  have  been  defined  as  any  area  of  of  subtidal  sand-sized  sediment 
within  the  same  sediment  environment  as  a  subtidal  sandbank.  Mobile  sediments  that  form  temporary 
sandbanks are considered to be associated sediments that should be retained in the system, but their location 
may change. Areas of holocence valley infill (relict sediment) are not mobile under present day estuarine 
conditions. Therefore, where Holocence infill is exposed, it is not considered to form part of the associated 
sediments. However, any mobile sand deposited over the infill  does contribute to the associated sediments. 
 
3 Distribution  
 
Distribution of sandbank communities and sediments refers to the macro spatial pattern in which these  are 
distributed  around  the  estuary.    This  statement  does  not  require  micro-distribution  of  communities  or 
sediments e.g. the exact mapped positions of specific communities or sediments to be maintained.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
The sand banks of the Middle and Welsh Grounds are relatively permanent sandbank features in the Severn 
Estuary, along with other long established sandbank features at Cardiff Grounds and in Bridgwater Bay. The 
tops  of  these  banks  are  intertidal,  and  the  permanently  submerged  parts  of  the  banks  are  considered  to 
contribute to the subtidal sandbanks habitat.  

There are other areas of subtidal sandbank habitat within the Estuary, again sometimes the top of the bank 
may  be  exposed  at  low  tide,  with  the  submerged  sections  contributing  to  the  subtidal  sandbanks  habitat. 
These  banks  are  more  ephemeral  in  nature,  but  are  still  considered  part  of  the  feature,  and  reflect  the 
dynamic nature of the Severn Estuary. The areas where ephemeral subtidal sandbanks are known to occur 
include areas offshore from Avonmouth and at English Grounds (near Clevedon).  
The macro-scale distribution of the subtidal sandbanks should be maintained, and there should be continued 
presence of  ephemeral subtidal sandbanks in the Estuary. 
 
4 Subtidal sandbank communities  
 
There are two groups of communities comprising the sub-features of the subtidal sandbanks feature: 
 

Infralittoral mobile sand in variable salinity (estuaries) 
Infralittoral mobile clean sand with sparse fauna 
Nephtys cirrosa and Macoma balthica in variable salinity infralittoral mobile sand 
Neomysis integer and Gammarus spp. in fluctuating low salinity infralittoral mobile sand

The total extent of the mudflats and sandflats feature2 is maintained;  

The  conservation  objective  for  mudflats  and  sandflats  feature  of  the  Severn    Estuary  SAC  is  to 
maintain the feature in favourable condition, as defined below: 
 
The feature will be considered to be in favourable condition when, subject to natural processes1, each of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
i. 
 
ii. 
 
iii. 
 
iv. 
 
v.  

the variety and extent of individual mudflats and sandflats communities3 within the site is maintained; 

the distribution4 of individual mudflats and sandflats communities3 within the site is maintained; 

the community composition5 of the mudflats and sandflats feature within the site is maintained; 

the topography of the intertidal flats and the morphology (dynamic processes of sediment movement 
and channel migration across the flats) are maintained. 

 
The meaning of terms 1-5 above is explained in section 4.1.3.1.

The meaning of natural processes is explained in section 4.1.1.1. 
 
2Extent of the intertidal mudflats and sandflats 
 
The extent of the feature  is defined using intertidal Phase 1 survey information, which gives the seaward 
limit of the feature as the low water mark of spring tides (MLWS) because that is in practice the lower limit 
to  which  Phase  1  survey  is  possible.  The  feature  does  not  include  other  intertidal  habitats  which  are  not 
mudflats and sandflats, such as intertidal reefs and rocky shores. This is the basis on which the feature is 
shown in the map in Figure 4, the total extent being 20,271 ha. However in addition there will be some areas 
of intertidal mudflat and sandflat seaward of MLWS and down to Lowest Astronomical Tide, which is the

The meaning of natural processes is explained in section 4.1.1.1. 
 
2 Atlantic salt meadow and associated transitional vegetation communities 
 
The vegetation communities comprising the Atlantic Salt Meadow feature can be grouped into four sub-
features, namely: 
 
(a) low to mid marsh communities 
(b) mid to upper marsh communities 
(c) transitional high marsh communities 
(d) pioneer saltmarsh communities 
 
The communities in each of these sub-features are listed below. 

 

60 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
 
Sub-features (a) and (b) contain the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) communities which fall within 
the definition of Atlantic Salt Meadow in the EU Interpretation Manual. The extent of these two sub-features 
within  the  SAC  is  currently  estimated  at  656  ha.  The  communities  in  (c)  and  (d)  do  not  fall  within  the 
Atlantic  Salt  Meadow  definition,  but  are  considered  to  be  important  components  of  this  feature  as  they 
represent  its  landward  and  seaward  transitions  to  other  habitat  types,  namely  non-saline  vegetation  and 
pioneer salt marsh respectively. Atlantic salt meadow is a naturally dynamic habitat and these transitional 
communities are considered to be an integral part of the Atlantic Salt Meadow feature and essential elements 
of its structure and function. The total extent of all four of the above sub-features in the SAC is estimated to 
be 1400 ha, distributed in the SAC as shown in Appendix 5a.

3 Maintained 
 
Since the late 1990s Natural Englands condition assessment has identified that parts of the saltmarsh within 
the Severn Estuary appear to be exhibiting the effects of coastal squeeze.  For this reason NE and CCW do 
not consider it sufficient simply to seek to maintain the existing saltmarsh resource, rather it is our advice 
that  measures will be required which seek to recreate the approximate extent of saltmarsh habitat present 
within the estuary in 1995 (the year the Severn Estuary was first identified as a proposed SAC); whilst at all 
times working within the framework of seeking a sustainable estuary form.  N.B. This is based upon a site 
specific consideration of the state of habitats within the Severn Estuary, and should not be extended to other 
sites on the basis of this advice. 
 
4Distribution 
 
The  distribution  Atlantic  salt  meadow  communities  refers  to  the  macro  spatial  pattern  in  which  these  are 
distributed around the estuary.  This statement does not require micro-distribution of communities e.g. the

  Refer to sections 4.2 and 4.3 of this document 
 
8 Spartina anglica SM6 
Spartina in the Severn is considered to be an invasive species and these conservation objectives do not seek 
the  maintenance  of  the  extent  or  condition  of  this  habitat  type.  However,  SM6  is  considered  to  be  a 
transitional  salt  marsh  community  and  the  conservation  objectives  seek  to  protect  the  ability  of  areas  of 
Spartina to develop into other Atlantic Salt Meadow or transitional communities.

estuary.  This statement does not require micro-distribution of the reefs e.g. the exact mapped positions of 
specific reefs to be maintained. 

 
3Sabellaria reef  
 
Little  is  known  about  the  nature  of  the  Sabellaria  alveolata  reef  in  the  Severn  Estuary,  especially  in  the 
subtidal. However, at other sites S. alveolata is known to have a very variable recruitment and the cover in 
any one area may vary greatly over a number of years. S. alveolata reefs also cycle through different phases, 
from newly settled worms through vigorous fast growing reef to older hummocks.  It is likely that subtidal S. 
alveolata reef in the Severn Estuary will exhibit reduced growth forms (lower elevation) in comparison to 
the intertidal reef habitat.  The easiest of these phases to identify is the fast growing reef and for the purposes 
of these conservation objectives this is  defined as a  dense aggregation of worms (over 1000 per  m2, as  a 
rough guide), generally forming a thick (2 cm or more) crust of tubes. The area covered by the habitat would 
generally exceed 25 m2 although there could be patchiness within this area. The other phases of growth are 
also important and are encompassed in point iii of the objective.  
 
The S. alveolata reef biotopes recorded in the Severn Estuary are SS.SBR.PoR.SalvMx Sabellaria alveolata 
on  variable  salinity  sublittoral  mixed  sediment  and  LS.LBR.Sab.Salv  Sabellaria  alveolata  reefs  on  sand-
abraded eulittoral rock.

4.1.6  SAC interest feature 6 : River lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis 
 
The  conservation  objective  for  the  river  lamprey  Lampetra  fluviatilis  feature  of  the  Severn  Estuary 
SAC is to maintain the feature in a favourable condition, as defined below: 
 
The feature will be considered to be in favourable condition when, subject to natural processes1, each of the 
following conditions are met: 
  
i. 

the migratory passage of both adult and juvenile river lamprey through the Severn  
Estuary between the Bristol Channel and any of their spawning rivers is not obstructed or impeded by 
physical barriers, changes in flows, or poor water quality; 

the size of the river lamprey population in the Severn Estuary and the rivers which drain into it, is at least 
maintained and is at a level that is sustainable in the long term; 

 
iii.  the  abundance  of  prey  species2  forming  the  river  lampreys  food  resource  within  the  estuary,  is

4.1.9  Favourable Condition Tables for the SAC interest features of the Severn 

Estuary European Marine Site 

Background information on the role of favourable condition tables and the information provided in each 
column is provided in Section 1.8 of this document, and a concise glossary of terms used is provided in 
Section 7.   
 
The favourable condition table is intended to supplement the conservation objectives, including with respect 
to the management of established and ongoing activities, future requirements of monitoring and reporting on 
the condition of the features of the site and, together with the conservation objectives, informs the scope and 
nature of any appropriate assessment that may be needed.  The table does not by itself provide a 
comprehensive basis on which to assess plans and projects as required under the Habitats Regulations.  It 
should be noted that appropriate assessments are a separate activity to condition monitoring, requiring 
consideration of issues specific to individual plans or projects.   
 
These tables set out all the attributes that may be used to monitor the condition of the features of the SAC.  
Where possible we will seek available information  from others which can inform our assessment process. 
 
It will be possible to monitor many of the attributes at the same time or during the same survey.  The 
frequency of sampling for many attributes may need to be greater during the first reporting cycle in order to 
characterise the site and establish the baseline.  Where relevant, abbreviations of National Vegetation 
Classification (NVC) codes  are used for simplicity (Rodwell, 2000).

The baseline is the extent of all areas 
subject to tidal influence within the 
boundary of the  designation of the 
pSAC in 2000 - see also map in  
Appendix 2 
 
The intra- and inter- estuarine TP/CS 
relationship  should not deviate 
significantly from an established 
baseline subject to natural processes 
 
(* includes recognition of fixed hard 
geology formations)  
 
Baseline to be established :-  
Data to be used  is Hydrological 
Office bathymetry data (intertidal and 
subtidal)  and Environment Agency 
LIDAR survey  

Extent is an attribute on which reporting is required by the 
Habitats Directive. 
 
 
 

TP = Tidal Prism = total volume of water crossing a given cross 
section during the flood tide (m3). 
CS = Area of a given cross section at high water springs (m2).  
The relationship between TP & CS provides a measure of the 
way the estuary has adjusted to tidal energy.  Substantial 
departures from this characteristic relationship (determined on a 
regional basis) may indicate the influence of anthropogenic 
factors and this would trigger more detailed evaluation of 
potential problems. 
 
The identification of a suitable baseline for TP/CS relationship 
will need to take account of the highly dynamic nature of the 
Severn and potential impacts of natural processes (including sea 
level rise) in altering the profile of the estuary  with a view to 
maintaining or promoting the movement of the estuary towards 
dynamic equilibrium. 
 
*The hard geology formations (headlands, cliffs and rock 
platforms) have a major role in influencing the characteristic 
physical form and flow of the estuary (many are protected in 
their own right as geological SSSI).

Coastal Habitat Management Plan 
(CHaMP) Part F- Sediment Budget 
Analysis  

A sediment budget is a balance of the sediment volume entering 
and exiting a particular section of the coast or an estuary. 
Sediment budget analysis consists of the evaluation of sediment 
fluxes, sources and sinks from different processes that give rise 
to additions and subtractions within a control volume (e.g. a 
section of coast or an estuary) in order to gain a better 
understanding of the estuary system.  
 
An estuary provides a readily defined control volume, where 
point sources and sinks exist in the form of rivers, other 
terrestrial outfalls and the open sea. Line sources and sinks may 
be defined in terms of erosion from cliffs and transfers to or 
from saltmarshes, wetlands or other intertidal areas. The 
subtidal beds also needs consideration as an important 
source/sink as does material stored in suspension within the 
volume of water that moves back and forth under tidal action 
within the estuary.  
 
Identification and quantification of all the mechanisms giving 
rise to sediment transfers can be difficult, and for the most part 
are approximate estimates of sediment exchange between 
sources and sinks.  
 
Reference ; ABPmer and HR Wallingford (2007).  
 
PSA measures parameters including percentage sand/silt/gravel, 
mean and median grain size and sorting co-efficient, used to 
characterise sediment type.  Sediment character is key to the 
structure of the features and reflects the physical processes 
acting on it  it may vary across the estuary and can be used to 
indicate the spatial distribution  of sediment types reflecting the 
stability  of the features and the processes supporting it..

The impacts of air pollution on the vegetation need further 
investigation. If particularly damaging, point sources (or groups 
of point sources) can be identified, then emissions should be 
regulated toreduce the impacts. It will also be very important for 
wider measures to be taken, at Government and international 
levels, to reduce air pollution. There is currently insufficient 
knowledge to make a judgment of the impacts on specific 
species. Decisions should be made at a site specific level."

Extent is an attribute on which reporting is required by the Habitats Directive.   
In the long term loss of intertidal mudflat / sandflat communities is likely to 
be detrimental to the structure of the interest feature, e.g. associated with a 
change in sediment budget or geomorphological regime, and may indicate 
long term changes in the physical conditions of the estuaries interest feature.   
Some fluctuations in extent may occur which are directly attributable to 
natural coastal processes.  These include reduced extent following storms or 
due to a change to another feature habitat such as saltmarsh.  Such types of 
change in extent would form under the umbrella of natural change

Changes in the spatial distribution of biotopes within an area of a particular 
type of sediment may provide the first indications of long-term changes in 
physical conditions at the site.   
 
Some biotopes occur in a natural cycle linked to the dynamism of the 
prevailing conditions, and these may naturally appear and disappear over time. 
The feature should not be considered in unfavourable condition due to the 
short-term disappearance of such ephemeral biotopes. 
 
 
Different associations of plants, animals and their habitat are an important 
structural and functional aspect of the feature.  Changes in the communities  
present within an area of a particular type of sediment may indicate long-term 
changes in physical conditions at the site. 
 
Typical species of the intertidal mudflats and sandflats communities include: 
Aphelochaeta marioni, Arenicola marina, Bathyporeia pelagica, Corophium 
volutator, Enchytraeidae, Eurydice pulchra, Hediste diversicolor, Hydrobia 
ulvae, Macoma balthica, Nephtys cirrosa, Nephtys hombergii, Oligochaeta 
indet, Pygospio elegans, Scoloplos armiger, Scrobicularia plana, Streblospio 
shrubsolii, Tubificoides benedii 
 
 
In the intertidal zone topography reflects the energy conditions and stability of 
the sediment, which is key to the structure of the interest feature. Topography 
is a major influence on the distribution of communities throughout the 
intertidal flats.  Assessing topography also provides information on the 
position of channels through the interest feature.  
 
 
. 
 
Parameters include percentage sand / silt / gravel, mean and median grain size, 
and sorting coefficient, used to characterise sediment type  
 
 Sediment character defined by particle size analysis is key to the structure of 
the feature, and reflects all of the physical processes acting on it.  Particle size 
composition varies across the feature and can be used to indicate spatial 
distribution of sediment types thus reflecting the stability of the feature and 
the processes supporting it.

Penetrability is an indicator of sediment stability and degree of compaction; it 
indicates the shear strength of the sediment and thus the susceptibility of that 
sediment type to erosion. Compaction of the sediment influences the 
biological community within the sediment. Penetrability of the sediment is 
determined by a combination of grain size and water content, which may 
provide a surrogate index of the penetrability of the sediments.  
 
Organic content critically influences the infaunal community and can cause 
deoxygenation of the feature, which can be detrimental to the biota. However, 
a balance needs to be struck as organic content provides a measure of the 
material available to detritivores. A reduction in organic content could lead to 
a reduction in detritivores, with subsequent knock on effects throughout the 
food chain. 
 
Degree of oxidation / reduction, reflecting oxygen availability within the 
sediment, critically influences the infaunal community and the mobility of 
chemical compounds. It is an indicator of the structure of the feature.

pioneer saltmarsh.  A reduction in extent could be further evaluated by a 
ground survey to assess for signs of erosion such as toppled vegetation blocks, 
signs of roots in intertidal mud, signs of stress/damage to plants.  Extent needs

Assessment against this target will take account of the effects of the natural 
process of cyclical development and breakdown of saltmarshes within the 
Severn which results in the natural succession of saltmarsh communities over 
time ie the continued presence of all types in proportions reflecting the natural 
processes operating.   
 
Some individual salt marsh communities occur in a natural cycle linked to the 
dynamism of the prevailing conditions, and these may naturally appear and 
disappear over time.  The feature should not be considered in unfavourable 
condition due to the short-term disappearance of transient communities. 
 
The outcome sought is the maintenance of the general character of the

The distribution of the Atlantic salt meadow communities refers to the macro 
spatial pattern in which these are distributed around the estuary. This 
statement does not require micro-distribution of communities (i.e. the exact 
mapped positions of specific communities to be maintained) but does require 
the distribution of some  saltmarsh types which reflect the differences in 
estuary structure and function (eg in outer versus inner parts of the estuary, or 
the influence of freshwater inputs from the rivers) be taken into account.  
 
 Consideration of this attribute needs to take account of the wider scale and 
long-term changes and development of saltmarshes in the  Severn Estuary 
which shows a pattern  of episodic erosion and accretion evident in a series of 
saltmarsh terraces. This attribute is also linked with attributes covering 
zonation and morphology below. 
 

Spartina anglica acts as a pioneer species in the Severn and can undergo 
succession to other saltmarsh habitats over time. As a consequence, although 
it may be colonising new areas in one part of the estuary, in others it may be 
developing into more mixed saltmarsh communities. There will be differences 
in the density, height  and cover of the vegetation depending on where it is in 
the succession. These changes will need to be monitored to establish a 
baseline and rates of any gross change. An increase in Spartina at the expense 
of other saltmarsh could indicate changes in the sediment regime and/or tidal 
levels both in response to natural or anthropogenic processes.  Monitoring will 
only focus on areas of gross expansion of Spartina into intertidal mudflat and 
saltmarsh communities. 
 
Assessment against this target will take account of the effects of the natural 
process of cyclical development and breakdown of saltmarshes within the 
Severn which results in the natural succession of saltmarsh communities and 
changes to the zonation over time . ie the continued presence of all zones in 
proportions reflecting the natural processes operating. 
   
The outcome sought is the maintenance of the general character of the 
saltmarshes of the Severn in terms of the continued  presence and variation of 
the saltmarsh zones with local differences reflected  it is not to seek the  
retention of zones in situ but to allow them to shift and evolve in line with 
natural processes

Nationally scarce and notable species within the Atlantic salt meadow and 
associated transitional vegetation communities comprise: 
Nationally scarce species:  
Alopecurus bulbosus, Althaea officinalis, Bupleurum tenuissimum, Hordeum 
marinum, Trifolium squamosum, Puccinellia rupestris, Polygonum raii. 
Other notable species occurring: 
 Allium oleraceum, Lepidium latifolium, Petroselinum segetum 
Note that some of the nationally scarce and notable plants require levels of 
ground disturbance (resulting in openings in the sward) to establish.  
Localised tight grazing and /or poaching may provide sward openings for such 
species as well as the wider range of herbs and unless widespread and 
persistent should not necessarily regarded as a problem. 
Vegetation structure is largely affected by the impact of grazing (of wild or 
domesticated herbivores) interacting with different vegetation communities 
and ground hydrological conditions.   
Not all Atlantic salt meadow within the Severn Estuary is grazed, but it is a 
widespread and long established practice and stocking levels need to be 
appropriate to the interest of the site.  Over grazing can lead to a loss of 
structural diversity of rare plant species and affect bird use of these habitats 
while under grazing can lead to a loss of plant diversity by competitive 
exclusion.  Introduction of grazing to previously ungrazed sites can result in 
deleterious changes to plant community composition and its value for wider 
conservation interests such as invertebrates. 
 
Note that some of the nationally scarce and notable plants require levels of 
ground disturbance (resulting in openings in the sward) to establish.  
Localised tight grazing and /or poaching may provide sward openings for such 
species as well as the wider range of herbs and unless widespread and 
persistent should not necessarily regarded as a problem.  Disturbance is also 
provided in areas where natural tidal debris accumulates scattered across the 
salt marsh and in driftlines (often at the base and on the seaward slope of the 
floodbank).  As well as providing seed establishment points for scarce plants 
the debris also plays a role in creating variation in sward structure particularly 
in the mid/upper and transition high marsh zones and in supporting important 
populations of invertebrates (notable deadwood beetles).  The continued 
presence of tidal debris and driftlines in some locations is therefore a desirable 
aspect of the saltmarsh management which delivers this attribute . They may 
also be of value for the bird populations which roost and feed on saltmarshes 
of the SPA and Ramsar Site. (see sections 4.2 and 4.3)

assessment data collected in 2002 for 
Gloucestershire section of the estuary.

This target relates to features which have developed naturally as a result of the 
evolution of the saltmarshes or the presence of freshwater drainage systems 
entering the estuary and which have established conservation value (eg pill 
sides of value botanically, pills used for shelter, feeding and roosting by 
birds).  The baseline dataset will establish the location and extent of these 
features and identify man made features which do not need to meet this target.

(total extent and

Measurement of the extent and distribution of 
the purely subtidal part of this feature in the 
Severn Estuary  is challenging.   Remote 
sensing methods (such as side scan sonar) and 
drop down video are unreliable in these 
conditions.  Therefore  limited grab sampling 
may be required. 
 
Measurement of the subtidal component at the

direct observation at very low tides.

Measurement of the community composition of

be required. 
 

No reduction in the extent and

Baseline is comprised of grab 
sampling  surveys by Mettam 1988 
supplemented by Environment Agency 
data 1999 and data from Warwick et 
al.2001 which provide subtidal reef 
records. 
 
CCW/English Nature Intertidal

distribution of intertidal Sabellaria 
alveolata and indication of locations 
for further survey for subtidal 
Sabellaria  contiguous with these

significant decline in community 
composition  from baseline records 
 
 
Baseline is survey by Mettam 1988

al.2001   

 Known occurrences of subtidal and subtidal contiguous with 
intertidal reefs are largely limited to the outer parts of the estuary 
(area seaward of a line drawn  between Portishead and Newport). See 
appendix 6.   Samples show that reef formation is not continuous 
within this area and is in varying stages of growth.   Further work is 
required to establish the distribution of this feature particularly with 
respect to the subtidal and the intertidal/subtidal interface. 
 
A further upstream zone of intertidal Sabellaria populations  is 
recorded up to the old Severn Bridge (Beachley to Aust) .  While not 
part of the reef feature the extent of solely intertidal Sabellaria is 
relevant as these areas will also  contribute larvae to the estuary wide 
populations of this species. 
 
The populations of Sabellaria within the Severn (subtidal,and 
intertidal) should be regarded as a metapopulation.   
 
New technologies that may allow the measurement of Sabellaria reef 
in a non destructive way should be investigated if they present 
themselves. 
 The reefs feature comprise two communities : 
 
Sabellaria alveolata on variable salinity sublittoral mixed sediment 
SS.SBR.PoR.SalvMx  
 
Sabellaria alveolata reefs on sand-abraded eulittoral rock. 
LS.LBR.Sab.Salv

Sabellaria alveolata reefs cycle through different phases from newly 
settled worms through vigorous fast-growing reef to older 
hummocks.  In a stable or increasing population all age phases are 
likely to be present . 
 
The presence of areas of variable stages of growth is important in 
ensuring larval supply and also enhances the species diversity of the 
reef 
 
 
An abundance of suitable coarse sediments (0.5-1mm sand) are 
required to support reef growth (tube building) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within the Severn reefs have been recorded both on solid geology 
and on smaller rocks and cobbles.  
 
 
 
 

Area of sampling for this attribute should include both the reef zone 
and areas where intertidal populations are known as all areas 
supporting  Sabellaria alveolata formations will be supplying larvae 
to the water column and hence may seed the reef feature. 
 Recruitment is likely to be variable between years.

(Barriers to

( migratory passage not

4.1.6.i and 4.1.7.i   of 
the conservation 
objectives) 

Significant variation in these physico-chemical parameters may act as 
barriers to migration.  For example, the timing, duration and consistency of 
their upstream migration are believed to be closely related to temperature 
changes as well as pheromone triggers from the juveniles during periods of 
high water flow.  Peak migration usually coincides with river temperatures 
that remain above 10oC and continues until temperatures reach 18oC.  
Dissolved oxygen can also be significantly reduced in stretches receiving 
significant BOD inputs, or through the re-suspension of organic rich 
sediments.  
 
Toxic contaminants may act as a barrier to migration.  Environmental 
Quality Standards (EQSs) are set for dangerous substances as defined 
under the Dangerous Substances Directive or Government Policy for 
freshwater and marine environments 

 
 

Dams, navigation and other weirs may prevent lamprey from reaching their 
spawning grounds.  In particular, sea lamprey is known to be poor at

For samples of 50 ammocoetes or less, at least 2 distinct size classes 
should normally be present.  If more than 50 ammocoetes are collected, at 
least 3 size classes should be present.   
2. Ammocoete distribution within catchment 
Lampreys should be present at not less than 2/3 of sites surveyed. 
3. Ammocoete density; 
  a. For lampetra; 
      Optimal habitat >10m-2 
      Overall catchment mean >5m-2 
   b. For sea lamprey - Ammocoetes should be present in at

of the conservation objectives in this section. 
 
Note  :  The  conservation  objectives  for  areas  of  the  SPA  which  lie  outside  the  European  Marine  Site

The  conservation  objective  is  to  maintain  the  Bewicks  swan  population  and  its  supporting  habitats1in

The interest feature Bewicks swan will be considered to be in favourable condition when, subject to natural 
processes2, each of the following conditions are met: 
 
(i) 

the  5  year  peak  mean  population  size  for  the  Bewicks  swan  population  is  no  less  than  289

2Natural processes in respect of the SPA 

Each interest feature is subject to both natural processes and human influences. Human influence on 
the  interest  features  is  acceptable  provided  that  it  is  compatible  with  the  achievement  of  the 
conditions set out under the definition of favourable condition for each interest feature. A failure to 
meet these conditions which is entirely a result of natural processes will not constitute unfavourable 
condition, but will trigger a review of  the definition of favourable condition. This qualification is 
necessary because: 

(a) the bird populations themselves are subject to natural factors, many of which arise outside the 
SPA, such as breeding success and winter temperatures; 

98 

 

 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

(b)  the  supporting  habitats  of  the  birds  are  influenced  by  the  evolution  of  the  estuary.  Natural 
adjustments  within  estuaries  can  take  many  forms.  One  important  example  is  the  tendency  of 
estuaries  to  accumulate  sediment,  thereby  changing  their  form  from  their  original  Holocene 
morphology  to  a  state  where  tidal  energy  is  dissipated  by  subtidal  and  intertidal  sediment  banks  or 
features.  This, with other natural processes, will therefore cause the width and depth of the estuary to 
change over time, moving towards a state of dynamic equilibrium or most probable state. As part of 
this  process,  the  location  and  extent  of  saltmarshes  and  mudflats  may  change,  provided  there  is 
capacity to accommodate readjustment. However, where this process is constrained, the capacity of 
habitats to accommodate readjustment may be affected.

Intertidal mudflats and sandflats 

 

Note : It is currently unclear what use this species is making of the estuary  they are clearly present 
in intertidal areas particularly around areas freshwater streams and pills enter the estuary.  Although 
primarily  freshwater  plant  feeders  they  do  also  take  animal  material  including  insects,  molluscs, 
annelids  and  even  small  fish  and  small  amphibians    it  is  possible  that  they  are  feeding  on  such 
matter  in  the  freshwater  influenced  mud  and  sands.    Recent  evidence  indicates  this  species  is 
changing it general habits as it extends its range westwards.  As a result the conservation objective 
for this species does not include a condition in respect of the key food sources as for other species at 
this time.

4.2.8  Favourable Condition Tables for SPA interest features of the Severn 

Estuary European Marine Site 

Background information on the role of favourable condition tables and the information provided in each 
column is provided in section 1.8 of this document, and a concise glossary of terms used is provided in 
Section 7.  
  
The favourable condition table is intended to supplement the conservation objectives, including with respect 
to the management of established and ongoing activities, future requirements of monitoring and reporting on 
the condition of the features of the site and, together with the conservation objectives, informs the scope and 
nature of any appropriate assessment that may be needed.  The table does not by itself provide a 
comprehensive basis on which to assess plans and projects as required under the Habitats Regulations.  It 
should be noted that appropriate assessments are a separate activity to condition monitoring, requiring 
consideration of issues specific to individual plans or projects.   
 
These tables set out all the attributes that may be used to monitor the condition of the features of the SPA.  
Where possible we will seek available information  from others which can inform our assessment process. 
 
It will be possible to monitor many of the attributes at the same time or during the same survey.  The 
frequency of sampling for many attributes may need to be greater during the initial monitoring events in 
order to characterise the site and establish the baselines.  Extreme events (such as storms reducing or 
increasing salinities, exceptionally cold winters or warm summers) also need to be recorded as they may be 
critical in influencing ecological issues in the Severn Estuary and may well be missed by routine monitoring.

Saltmarsh provides an important feeding and 
roosting habitat for Bewicks swans on The 
Dumbles - saltmarsh/transition wet grassland in 
front of sea defences. 
Bewicks swans graze on soft wet meadow grasses 
such as Agrostis stolonifera, Glyceria fluitans and 
Alopecurus geniculatus which are found in the 
transition of saltmarsh to grassland. 

Bewicks swan require unrestricted views >500m to 
allow early detection of predators when feeding and 
roosting. 

The intertidal mudflats and sandflats at The Noose, 
Frampton Sand and Waveridge Sand are used as 
disturbance refuge for Bewicks swan.  The extent 
and distribution of this sub-feature are important to 
maintain the population in favourable condition. 
Bewicks swan require unrestricted views >500m to

4.3  Conservation objectives for the Severn Estuary / Mor Hafren Ramsar Site 
 
The protection and management of the Ramsar  in accordance with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, 
including in particular the consideration of plans and projects under Article 6(3) and 6(4), should be carried 
out in view of the conservation objectives in this section. 
 
4.3.1  Ramsar interest feature 1: Estuaries 
 
The conservation objective for the estuaries feature of the  Severn Estuary Ramsar Site is to 
maintain the feature in favourable condition, as defined by the conservation objective for the SAC 
estuaries  feature (refer to section 4.1.1 and Table 8 of this document),  in so far as these objectives 
are applicable to the area designated as Ramsar Site and as defined below. 
 
4.3.1.1 Explanatory information for the Ramsar Site estuaries conservation objective 
 
The area of the estuarine ecosystem designated as Ramsar Site is smaller than that of the SAC as it is 
restricted to the terrestrial and intertidal areas and excludes all subtidal areas.  There are therefore aspects of 
the SAC estuaries conservation objective that are not applicable to the Ramsar Site estuaries feature.  
The following Table 17 identifies the limits and restrictions, if any, that apply in respect of the Ramsar Site.  
The table layout follows the numbering of the SAC estuaries objective conditions given in section 4.1.1.

4.3.2  Ramsar interest feature 2: Assemblage of migratory fish species1 
 
The conservation objective for the assemblage of migratory fish species feature of the  Severn 
Estuary Ramsar Site is to maintain the feature in favourable condition, as defined below: 
 
The feature will be considered to be in favourable condition when, subject to natural processes2, each of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
i. 

the migratory passage of both adults and juveniles of the assemblage of migratory fish species through 
the Severn Estuary between the Bristol Channel and any of their spawning rivers is not obstructed or 
impeded by physical barriers, changes in flows, or poor water quality; 

 
ii 

the size of the populations of the assemblage species in the Severn Estuary and the rivers which drain 
into it, is at least maintained and is at a level that is sustainable in the long term; 

 
iii. the abundance of prey species3 forming the principle food resources for the assemblage species within the 

estuary, is maintained. 
 

iv.  Toxic contaminants in the water column4 and sediment are below levels which would pose a risk to the 

ecological objectives described above. 

 
The meaning of terms 1-4 above is explained in section 4.3.2.1 
  
Note :  The populations of three of the assemblage species (river lamprey, sea lamprey and twaite shad) are 
designated as features of the SAC for which separate specific objectives have been written (refer to sections 
4.1.6 to 4.1.8 of this document).   The populations of these species depend on habitat in the adjacent River 
Usk SAC, River Wye SAC and River Severn. The habitats in these rivers, including spawning and nursery 
areas, are essential for the fulfilment of the species lifecycle and therefore these features can only be in 
favourable condition  if the conservation objectives pertaining to the River Usk SAC and  River Wye SAC  
are also met in full and there is a continued recorded presence of these species in the River Severn.

3Prey species 
 

Key prey species 
Eel Anguilla anguilla, cod Gadus morhua, and haddock 
Melanogrammus aeglefinus are all potential prey species for the 
sea lamprey found within the Severn Estuary (Bird 2008) 
Sea trout Salmo trutta, shad Alosa fallax/Alosa alosa, herring 
Clupea harengus, sprat Sprattus sprattus, flounder Platichthys 
flesus and small gadoids such as whiting Merlangius merlangus 
and pout Trisopterus luscus are all potential prey species for the 
river lamprey found within the Severn Estuary (Bird 2008). 
Small custaceans, especially mysids and copepods, small fish, 
especially sprats and anchovies, and fish eggs (Maitland, P.S. & 
Hatton-Ellis 2003). 
Small custaceans, especially mysids and copepods, small fish, 
especially sprats and anchovies, and fish eggs (Maitland, P.S. & 
Hatton-Ellis 2003). 
While at sea, salmon feed on a variety of fish (e.g. herring, sprat, 
sand eel, mackerel, and various gadoids) and crustaceans (e.g. 
euphausiid shrimps, prawns, gammarid amphipods and various 
crabs). (Bird, 2008) 
The diet of this species at sea has not been much studied but is 
believed to include a range of fish species including sprat, young 
herring and sand eels as well as crustaceans such amphipods (e.g. 
Corophium), gammarids, decapods such as Crangon and mysid 
shrimps. Many of these prey items also occur in estuaries where 
sea trout are known to feed extensively. (Bird, 2008) 
A range of benthic organisms that include crustaceans and small 
fish. (Bird, 2008)

Favourable Condition Tables for the Ramsar Site interest features 
of the Severn Estuary European Marine Site 

Background information on the role of favourable condition tables and the information provided in each 
column is provided in section 1.8 of this document, and a concise glossary of terms used is provided in 
Section 7.  
  
The favourable condition table is intended to supplement the conservation objectives, including with respect 
to the management of established and ongoing activities, future requirements of monitoring and reporting on 
the condition of the features of the site and, together with the conservation objectives, informs the scope and 
nature of any appropriate assessment that may be needed.  The table does not by itself provide a 
comprehensive basis on which to assess plans and projects as required under the Habitats Regulations.  It 
should be noted that appropriate assessments are a separate activity to condition monitoring, requiring 
consideration of issues specific to individual plans or projects.   
 
These tables set out all the attributes that may be used to monitor the condition of the features of the Ramsar 
Site.  Where possible we will seek available information  from others which can inform our assessment 
process. 
 
It will be possible to monitor many of the attributes at the same time or during the same survey.  The 
frequency of sampling for many attributes may need to be greater during the initial monitoring events in 
order to characterise the site and establish the baselines.  Extreme events (such as storms reducing or 
increasing salinities, exceptionally cold winters or warm summers) also need to be recorded as they may be 
critical in influencing ecological issues in the Severn Estuary and may well be missed by routine monitoring.

Comments 

The Favourable Condition Table for the estuaries feature of the Severn Estuary Ramsar Site is largely the same as that for the 
Severn Estuary SAC estuaries feature (see section 4.1 : Table 8). 

However the area of the estuarine ecosystem designated as Ramsar Site is smaller than that of the SAC as it is restricted to the terrestrial 
and intertidal areas and excludes all subtidal areas.  Table 17 identifies the limits and restrictions that apply in respect of the Ramsar Site 
Conservation Objective. 
 
There are therefore aspects of the SAC estuaries Favourable Condition Table that are not applicable to the Ramsar Site 
estuaries feature as follows : 

  All attributes other than those referred to below - apply only in respect of the area within the Ramsar Boundary (as shown in 

  Line A6  -  which relates to the subtidal sandbanks subfeature of the estuaries feature -  this does not apply as these habitats lie 

Appendix 2) 

outside the boundary of the Ramsar Site 

  Line A9  - which relates to the reefs subfeature of the estuaries feature -  this only applies in respect of areas where intertidal 

Sabellaria alveolota occurs contiguously with the subtidal reefs (yet to be fully defined).

Agency  

Significant variation in these physio-chemical parameters 
may act as barriers to migration.  For example, the timing, 
duration and consistency of their upstream migration are 
believed to be closely related to temperature changes as well 
as pheromone triggers from the juveniles during periods of 
high water flow.  Peak migration usually coincides with river 
temperatures that remain above 10oC and continues until 
temperatures reach 18oC.  
Dissolved oxygen can also be significantly reduced in 
stretches receiving significant BOD inputs, or through the re-
suspension of organic rich sediments.  
Toxic contaminants may act as a barrier to migration.   
 

 
 
 

Dams, navigation and other weirs may prevent fish from 
reaching their spawning grounds.  In particular, sea lamprey 
is known to be poor at ascending obstacles.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
 
5.  Advice on Operations  
 
CCW and Natural England have a duty under Regulation 33(2)(b) of The Conservation (Natural 
Habitats &c.) Regulations 1994 to advise other relevant authorities as to any operations which may 
cause  deterioration  of  natural  habitats  or  the  habitats  of  species,  or  disturbance  of  species,  for 
which the site has been designated. Information on how CCW and Natural England have developed 
this  advice  is  given  in  section  5.2,  and  on  how  it  may  be  reviewed  and  updated  in  the  future  in 
section 5.3. 
 
The Advice on Operations concerning the SAC are provided in detail in Table 22 and section 5.6.  The 
Advice  on  Operations  concerning  the  SPA  is  provided  in  Table  23  and  section  5.7.    These  include 
recommendations  regarding  specific  interest  features  and  their  supporting  habitats.  The  Advice  on 
Operations concerning the Ramsar Site is provided by cross reference to the subsections of the advice for 
the SAC and SPA which are relevant to the Ramsar Site interest features. 
 
5.1.  Purpose of advice 
 
The aim of this advice is to provide CCW and Natural Englands Advice on Operations as required by 
Regulation  33  (2)(b)for  the  Severn  Estuary  European  Marine  Site  and  thereby  enable  all  relevant 
authorities  to  direct  and  prioritise  their  work  on  the  management  of  activities  that  pose  the  greatest 
potential threat to the favourable condition of interest features on the Severn Estuary European Marine 
Site. The advice should be read in conjunction with the Conservation Objectives for the SAC, SPA and 
Ramsar Sites interest features given in sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 respectively and it is intended to provide 
the basis for detailed discussions to formulate and agree a management scheme for the European Marine 
Sites. 
 
General advice on sensitivity, exposure (and therefore vulnerability) contained within this document is 
presented against broad categories of operation which may cause the deterioration of natural habitats or 
the habitats of species, or the disturbance of species (refer to section 5.2). It reflects activities and plans 
and  projects.  Generic  examples  of  some  of  the  types  of  operation  that  are  covered  under  the  broad 
category headings are given for illustration.   
  
The advice is based on best available information at the time of preparation of the Regulation 33 advice 
for the Severn Estuary in 2008/09. For a current assessment of levels of disturbance of specific types of 
activity across the Severn Estuary (relevant solely to the SPA interest features), reference should be made 
to 
website 
(http://www.severnestuary.net/asera/). It should be noted, however, that the frequency, intensity, effects 
and level of risk to the SPA features that certain activities may have are still being investigated under the 
existing Severn Estuary Scheme of Management.  
 
5.2  Methods for assessment 
 
The advice provided here is within six broad categories of operation which may cause the deterioration of 
natural habitats or the habitats of species, or the disturbance of species. These categories are: 
 
  Physical loss 
  Physical damage 
  Non-physical disturbance 
  Toxic contamination 
  Non-toxic contamination 
  Biological disturbance

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Within these categories are environmental impacts that may result from operations. Example sources of 
activities are provided in the MarLIN Maritime and coastal activities to environmental factors matrix (see 
Appendix 10), although these are by no means inclusive of all potentially damaging activities. 
 
Given  current  knowledge of  the  nature  and  extent  of  activities  taking  place  within  the  Severn  Estuary 
European Marine Site, this approach therefore: 
 
 

enables links to be made between human activities and the ecological requirements of the  
habitats or species, as required under Article 6 of the Habitats Directive; 

 

  provides a consistent framework to enable relevant authorities in England and Wales to assess the 

effects of activities and identify priorities for management within their areas of responsibility; and 
is appropriately robust to take into account the development of novel activities or operations which 
may cause deterioration or disturbance to the interest features of the site and should have sufficient 
stability to need only infrequent review and updating by the CCW and Natural England. 
 

 

 

These broad categories provide a clear framework against which relevant authorities can assess activities 
or  operations  under  their  responsibility.  The  more  detailed  information  in  Tables  22  and  23  (covering 
both  the  SAC  and  SPA)  provides  competent  authorities  with  a  context  against  which  to  consider  an 
assessment of significant effect of any plans or projects which may affect the site and a basis to inform 
on  the  scope  and  nature  of  appropriate  assessments  required  in  relation  to  plans  and  projects.  It  is 
important to note that this advice is only a starting point for assessing impacts. It does not remove the 
need  for  the  relevant  or  competent  authorities  to  consult  CCW  or  Natural  England  formally  over 
individual plans and projects where required to do so under the Regulations. 
 
This Advice on Operations for the site is based on a three-step process involving: 
 
 

an  assessment  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  interest  features  or  their  component  supporting  habitats  to 
operations; 
an  assessment  of  the  current  exposure  of  each  interest  feature  or  their  component  supporting 
habitats to operations; and 
a  final  assessment  of  current  vulnerability  of  interest  features  or  their  component  supporting 
habitats to operations. 

 
Note  that  in  respect  of  the  SPA,  sensitivity,  exposure  and  vulnerability  have  been  assessed  largely  in 
relation to the use of habitats by birds, but may also take into account direct effects on the bird species 
themselves (such as shooting or disturbance). 
 
This three-step process builds up a level of information necessary to manage activities in and around the 
European Marine Site in an effective manner and to identify to competent and relevant authorities those 
operations which pose the most immediate threats to the favourable condition of the interest features of 
the European Marine Site. 
 
The assessment of relative sensitivity, exposure and vulnerability is derived using best available scientific 
information  and  informed  scientific  interpretation  and  judgement.  The  process  uses  sufficiently  coarse 
categorisation  to  minimise  uncertainty  in  information,  reflecting  the  current  state  of  knowledge  and 
understanding of the marine environment. Where possible, the sensitivity, exposure and vulnerability are 
assessed on a three-point scale of Low, Moderate or High. To assist with interpretation, these levels 
have been colour-coded in Tables 22 & 23. 
 
5.2.1  Sensitivity assessment 
 
The sensitivity assessment used is an assessment of the relative sensitivity of the interest features or the 
component supporting habitats of the Severn Estuary European Marine Site to the effects of six broad 
categories  of  human  activities.  In  relation  to  this  assessment,  sensitivity  has  been  defined  as  the 
intolerance of a habitat, community or individual (or individual colony) of a species to damage, or 
death, from an external factor and the time taken for its subsequent recovery (MarLIN, 2003). For 

 

127 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
example, a very sensitive species or habitat is one that is very adversely affected by an external factor 
arising from human activities or natural events (killed/destroyed, high intolerance) and is expected to 
recover over a very long period of time, i.e. >10 or up to 25 years (low recoverability).  
 
The  sensitivity  assessments  are  based  on  current  information  but  may  develop  with  improvements  in 
scientific knowledge and understanding. The sensitivity of interest features (and scientific understanding 
of  sensitivity)  may  change  over  time;  hence  an  operation  which  is  not  currently  considered  to  have  a 
negative effect, may do so in the future. 
 
English  Nature  (now  Natural  England)  and  Scottish  Natural  Heritage  commissioned  the  Marine 
Biological  Association  of  the  UK,  through  its  Marine  Life  Information  Network  (MarLIN)  to  provide 
detailed sensitivity information to underpin this advice. Detailed sensitivity information at a biotope or 
species  level  is  available  via  MarLINs  website  (www.marlin.ac.uk).  The  sensitivity  assessments  are 
indicative qualitative judgements based on the best available scientific information. They represent the 
most  likely  (probable)  result  of  a  given  change  in  a  factor.  The  sensitivity  assessments  of  the  interest 
features or their component supporting habitats of the Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site are 
based  upon  MarLIN  sensitivity  assessments  for  biotopes  (components  of  the  Annex  I  habitats)  and 
species  supplemented  by  local  knowledge  and  professional  judgement  to  provide  a  site  specific 
assessment that reflect the unusual and extreme character of the Severn Estuary.  
 
The  sensitivities  of  each  of  the  SAC  Annex  I  habitat  features  have  been  assessed  on  the  component 
biotopes represented within each of the habitats (where information is available).  Where information has 
not  been  available,  such  as  for  subtidal  Sabellaria  alveolata  reefs  or  for  Atlantic  saltmeadow 
communities, a number of scientific review documents have been consulted, including reports produced 
for the UK Marine SAC LIFE project (see Bibliography section for a full list of these). 
 
Assessments  for  the  Annex  II  migratory  fish  have  been  based  on  current  knowledge  (best  available 
scientific knowledge), which is limited for the life phase that shad and lamprey spend in estuarine waters. 
Given the paucity of information, it has not been possible to assess the level of sensitivity on a three-point 
scale; they have been assessed to be either sensitive or not sensitive.  
 
For  the  SPA,  the  sensitivities  have  been  assessed  in  relation  to  the  use  of  habitats  by  birds  and  the 
sensitivities  of the individual species  themselves to certain activities. For example, wintering birds are 
highly sensitive to the loss of their roosting or feeding grounds; and they are highly sensitive to the noise 
of shooting. The sensitivity assessments of the interest features or their component supporting habitats of 
the  Severn  Estuary  SPA  are  based  on a  number  of  scientific  review  documents.  These  include  reports 
produced  for  the  UK  Marine  SAC  LIFE  project  (Davison  &  Hughes  1998;  Elliott  et  al.,  1998),  the 
Countryside Council for Wales Science Report (Holt et al., 1995) and the Marine Habitats Review (Jones 
et al., 2000.). 
 
The magnitude or scale of the effect of an activity and the resultant change in environmental factors are 
site specific. For the purpose of this advice, the assessments of sensitivity have been adjusted for changes 
in suspended sediments and turbidity to reflect the particular conditions affecting the site. As a result of 
the high tidal energy of the site, the concentration of suspended sediment and turbidity are naturally very 
high.  The  marine  fauna,  including  the  migratory  fish,  are  adapted  to  such  high  concentrations  of 
suspended  sediment  and  thus  they  are  unlikely  to  have  any  significant  effect.  Consequently  the 
sensitivities relating to changes in suspended sediments and turbidity have been downgraded. 
 
Table 22 shows the sensitivity assessments for the SAC features and sensitivity assessments for the SPA 
can be seen in Table 23. 
 
5.2.2  Exposure assessment 
 
Exposure assessment has been undertaken for the Severn Estuary European Marine Site by assessing the 
relative exposure of the interest features or their component supporting habitats to the effects of broad 
categories  of  operations,  resulting  from  human  activities  currently  occurring  on  the  site.  Exposure  has 
been  assessed  against  a  matrix  which  relates  activities  to  operation  pressures  (see  Appendix  10).  The 

 

128 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
matrix has been used as a guide and interpreted to assess the exposure to current activities known to be 
present within the site.  
 
In assigning a three-point score (High, Moderate or Low) to the exposure, each activity is considered for: 

  Spatial extent of the pressure 
  Frequency of the pressure and 
 

Intensity of the pressure  

Update and review of advice 

 
For the SPA, the exposure has been assessed in relation to the use of habitats by birds and on the bird 
species  themselves.  As  an  example,  the  feeding  and  roosting  grounds  of  wintering  birds  may  be 
considered  highly  exposed  to  toxic  contamination  from  synthetic  compounds  due  to  the  locations  and 
intensity of discharges into an area. 
 
5.2.3  Vulnerability assessment 
 
The  third  step  in  the  process  is  to  determine  the  vulnerability  of  interest  features  or  their  component 
supporting habitats to operations. This category results from an integration of sensitivity and exposure. 
Only if a feature is both sensitive and exposed to a human activity will it be considered vulnerable.  In 
this  context  therefore,  vulnerability  has  been  defined  as  the  exposure  of  a  habitat,  community  or 
individual (or individual colony) of a species to an external factor to which it is sensitive (Hiscock, 
1996). 
 
Tables  22  and  23  show  the  vulnerability  assessments  for  the  SAC  features  and  the  SPA  features 
respectively. 
 
5.3 
 
Information as to the categories of operations which may cause the deterioration of natural habitats or the 
habitats  or  disturbance  of  species  for  which  the  site  has  been  designated,  is  provided  in  light  of  what 
CCW and Natural England know about current activities and patterns of usage within the Severn Estuary 
European Marine Site. The general information on current activities and patterns of usage (which was 
used in part to derive Table 23) has been refined at the local level in producing the management scheme 
for  the  SPA  and  through  further  discussion  with  the  relevant  authorities.  This  management  scheme  is 
available at the ASERA website (http://www.severnestuary.net/asera/) although this will require review 
following this more detailed analysis of impacts on the estuarine habitats that are supporting habitats for 
the birds of the SPA.  
 
The information provided in this advice on the sensitivity of interest features or their supporting habitats 
(Table  23)  will  change  as  a  result  of  an  improvement  in  our  scientific  knowledge,  which  will  be  a 
relatively long term process. It is suggested that advice for sites be kept under review and is periodically 
updated  through  discussion  with  relevant  authorities  and  others  to  reflect  significant  changes  in  our 
understanding  of  sensitivity  together  with  the  potential  effects  of  plans  and  projects  on  the  marine 
environment. 
 
5.4  Plans and Projects 
 
Under  Regulation  48(1),  an  appropriate  assessment  must  be  undertaken  by  competent  authorities  in 
respect of any plan or project which: 
 
a. 

either alone or in combination with other plans or projects is likely to have a significant effect on 
a European site; and 
is not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site for nature conservation. 

b. 
 
This legal requirement applies to all European sites (SACs and SPAs). Regulation 48 is also applied, as a 
matter of Government policy, to proposed SPAs and listed Ramsar sites.  
 

 

129 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
Tables 22 and 23 provides competent authorities with a guide against which to initiate an assessment of 
the significance of any plans or projects (and on-going operations or activities) proposed for the site, 
although  this  will  only  be  a  starting  point  for  assessing  impacts  and  does  not  remove  the  need  for 
competent  authorities  to  consult  CCW  or  Natural  England  formally  over  individual  plans  and  projects 
where required under the Regulations. 
 
5.5  Review of consents 
 
Regulation  50  of  the  Conservation  (Natural  Habitats,  &c.)  Regulations  1994  requires  a  competent 
authority to undertake a review of any existing consent or permission to which Regulation 48(1) would 
apply  if  it  were  to  be  reconsidered  as  of  the  date  on  which  the  site  became  a  European  site.  Where  a 
review is required under these provisions it must be carried out as soon as reasonably practicable after 
classification  of  the  European  Marine  Site.  Consents  will  need  to  be  reviewed  in  the  light  of  these 
objectives.

5.6  Specific Advice on Operations for the Severn Estuary SAC 
 
This section provides information to help relate general advice to each of the specific interest features of 
the Severn Estuary SAC. Where specific examples are given they are provided to aid understanding of 
possible impacts and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all relevant operations. 
 
This  advice  relates  to  the  vulnerability  of  the  interest  features  and  supporting  habitats  of  the  Severn 
Estuary SAC as set out in more detail in Table 22. A brief explanation of the sensitivity of the interest 
features  or  supporting  habitats  follows,  with  an  explanation  of  their  exposure  and  consequently  their 
vulnerability to damage or disturbance from the listed categories of operations is also given. This enables 
links between the categories of operation and the ecological requirements of the European Marine Site 
and Ramsar Site interest features to be made. 
 
The precise impact of any category of operation occurring on the site will be dependent upon the nature, 
scale,  location  and  timing  of  events.  In  accordance  with  Government  policy  guidance,  the  Advice  on 
Operations provided here, is feature and site specific, and provided in the light of current activities and 
patterns of usage at the site.  
 
As such, it is important that future consideration of this advice by relevant authorities, and others, takes 
account of changes in usage patterns that have occurred at the site over the intervening period. Advice for 
sites  should  be  kept  under  review:  it  is  suggested  that  periodic  discussions  with  relevant  authorities  and 
others  be  undertaken  to  reflect  significant  changes  in  the  understanding  of  sensitivities,  as  well  as  the 
potential effects of future plans or projects on the marine environment.

5.6.1.1  Sensitivity 
 
The estuary and its associated biological communities are moderately to highly sensitive to:  
 
  physical loss  
  physical damage 
 
  non-toxic contamination and 
  biological disturbance 
 
These  result  from  a  range  of  activities  known  to  occur  in  the  estuary.  Further  details  are  provided  in 
points i) to xiv) below, with details of the level of sensitivity set out in Table 22. 
 
5.6.1.2  Exposure 
 
The estuary and its associated biological communities are moderately to highly exposed to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  abrasion and physical disturbance  
  noise and visual disturbance

changes in suspended sediment 
changes in water flow rate 
changes in wave exposure 

Substratum loss 

5.6.1.3  Vulnerability 
 
The estuary and its associated biological communities are moderately to highly vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
The  estuary  feature  is  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore  high 
vulnerability to substratum loss. 
 
The physical loss of areas of intertidal habitats may be caused directly through a change in land use, or 
indirectly as a consequence of changes to sedimentation processes (e.g. resulting from the construction of 
groynes or of seawalls). Subtidal sedimentary habitats will be directly affected by the removal of material 
during maintenance dredging and aggregate extraction in particular. These activities, coupled with strong 
current flows, result in material being suspended in the water column and removed away from their point 
of  origin.  Removal  of  the  substratum  will  lead  to  partial  loss  of  faunal  diversity,  exposure  of  the 
underlying sediment and changes in the topography of the area. Intertidal seagrass beds will be adversely 
affected by substratum loss, with recoverability depending upon recruitment from other populations.  
 

 

132 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Smothering 

 
ii. 
The estuary feature is considered to have high sensitivity and moderate exposure and therefore high 
vulnerability to smothering  
 
Smothering of organisms is likely to occur as a result of the direct deposition of material on top of them 
and/or  on  their  habitat.  Examples  of  activities  causing  smothering  in  intertidal  areas  include  beach 
replenishment, port developments, archaeological activities, coastal farming, industrial effluent discharge, 
oil spills, land runoff including highways discharge and sewage discharge. In subtidal areas, dumping of 
spoil  from  dredging  operations  is  responsible  for  most  smothering  events.  Both  intertidal  and  subtidal 
seagrass  beds  are  considered  to  be  highly  sensitive  to  smothering.  A  seagrass  bed  close  to  the  second 
Severn  crossing  is  known  to  have  been  adversely  affected  by  smothering  as  a  result  of  changes  to 
sediment movements due to temporary works associated with the bridge construction in the early 1990s. 
 
iii.  Changes in suspended sediment  
The estuary feature is considered to have moderate sensitivity and moderate exposure and therefore 
moderate vulnerability to changes in suspended sediment 
 
As a result of the high tidal energy of the site, the concentration of suspended sediment and turbidity are 
naturally very high. This high tidal energy is one of the reasons for site selection as part of the Natura 
2000  series.  The  marine  fauna,  including  the  migratory  fish,  are  adapted  to  high  concentrations  of 
suspended sediment.  Increase in sediment in suspension is unlikely to cause problems unless it leads to 
smothering  (see  smothering).    Of  greater  concern  in  the  Severn  estuary  would  be  the  decrease  in 
suspended sediments leading to increased light penetration and changes in the habitats and their plant and 
animal communities.  
 
Activities  likely  to  result  in  changes  in  suspended  sediment  would  include  those  which  would  affect 
sediment availability or the water flow rate (coastal defences, development, construction and dredging).   
 
iv.  Changes in water flow rate  
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  be moderate sensitivity and  high exposure    and 
therefore high vulnerability to changes in water flow rate. 
 
The estuary is considered to have high exposure due to its highly constrained nature (by man made hard 
defences).  Increases  or  decreases  to  the  water  flow  rate  are  likely  to  lead  to,  respectively,  increased 
sediment erosion or accretion in certain areas. Seagrass beds in particular are intolerant to any activity 
that changes the sediment regime. Activities/structures responsible for changing the water flow rate could 
include in-estuary construction; groynes, beach replenishment, sea walls/breakwaters, port developments 
and aggregate extraction.  
 
v. 
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore 
high vulnerability to changes in wave exposure. 
 
The  estuary  is  considered  to  have  high  exposure  due  to  its  highly  constrained  nature  (coastal  defence 
structures; groynes, seawalls, breakwaters and beach replenishment) and presence of significant aggregate 
extraction  which  can  cause  changes  in  wave  exposure.  Storms  and  intense  wave  action  may  move  or 
remove  substrata  from  shallow  subtidal  sandbanks.  Increased  wave  action  will  disrupt  feeding  and 
burrowing, and reduce species abundance, richness and biomass. Decreased wave exposure will result in 
increased food availability, but suspension feeders are intolerant of sediment increases in silt/clay content 
and  therefore  the  proportion  of  suspension  feeders  may  decrease  in  favour  of  deposit  feeders.  Both 
intertidal and subtidal seagrass beds are highly sensitive to changes in wave exposure, with an increase 
leading to loss of substrata and exposure of rhizomes, and a decrease causing deposition of fine particles 
on leaves which may result in smothering. 
 

Changes in wave exposure

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Toxic contamination 

 
vi.  Abrasion and physical disturbance  
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and 
therefore high vulnerability to physical disturbance and abrasion. 
 
This factor includes mechanical interference, crushing, trampling, rubbing or erosion of the organism or 
habitat of interest. The activities most likely to cause abrasion include beach replenishment, development 
of  port  facilities,  maintenance  dredging,  aggregate  extraction,  fixed  netting,  benthic  trawls,  sea-based 
recreation (including anchoring, power boat and jet ski wash), archaeology, coastal farming, educational 
visits, shipping, litter and debris. Habitats/communities that are moderately sensitive to abrasion include 
saltmarsh  - see section 4.4 (at risk from overgrazing, erosion from moored boats or from trampling or 
vehicles), intertidal mudflats and sandflats (see section 4.3), and seagrass beds in particular. 
 
vii. 
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and 
therefore high vulnerability to toxic contamination. (Note that there is currently insufficient scientific 
information on the sensitivities of the estuarine habitats to radionuclides to determine any vulnerability). 
 
This  category  includes  contamination  from  synthetic  compounds  (including  pesticides  and  herbicides), 
non-synthetic compounds (including heavy metals) and hydrocarbons (oil related products). As a result of 
the predominance of physical conditions within the Estuary, for the majority of biological communities 
there  is  little  unequivocal  evidence  of  additional  impact  due  to  contaminants  across  the  Estuary  as  a 
whole. Individual populations may have been impacted close to major discharges however. 
 
A number of synthetic compounds may be present locally in elevated concentrations. Riverine inputs are 
probably  responsible  for  the  majority  of  these  compounds  entering  the  Estuary.  The  concentration  of 
metals  in  sediments  (cadmium,  arsenic,  chromium,  silver,  copper,  zinc  and  nickel  in  particular)  are 
commonly  above  interim  sediment  quality  guidelines  over  much  of  the  Estuary,  but  only  occasionally 
exceed  probable  effects  levels  (Langston  et  al.,  2003).  Bioaccumulation  of  metals  occurs  widely  in 
invertebrates, though the ecological significance is still uncertain. Hydrocarbon compounds may also be 
present  locally  in  elevated  concentrations.  Sources  include  a  combination  of  fossil  fuel  combustion, 
shipping, urban run-off, sewage treatment works and various point-source and diffuse discharges from 
industrialised  areas.  Moderately  high  levels  of  poly-aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  are  present  in 
sediments  across  much  of  the  Estuary.      Overall  vulnerability  to  all  toxic  contamination  is  considered 
high (due to the exposure from sewage inputs being classed as high and also with moderate levels 
from industrial inputs etc.).  
 
Note that there is currently insufficient scientific information on the sensitivities of the estuarine habitats 
to  radionuclides  to  determine  any  vulnerability.    However  despite  the  presence  of  several  potential 
sources  of  radionuclides  (Berkeley,  Oldbury  and  Hinkley  Nuclear  Power  Plants,  a  manufacturer  of 
radiopharmaceuticals in Cardiff and a number of other smaller sources) the accumulation of radionuclides 
in the Severn Estuary is generally low compared with samples from the Irish Sea. The exceptions to this 
are  Tritium  and  Carbon  14,  which  have  been  found  locally  at  significant  levels.  This  is  thought  to  be 
related  to  discharges  from  the  radiopharmaceutical  company  in  Cardiff,  for  which  remedial  action  is 
being taken. (Langston et al, 2003). 
 
viii.  Changes in nutrient loading  
The  estuary  feature  is  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  to  changes  in  nutrient 
loading  but  is  not  considered  vulnerable  to  changes  in  nutrient  loading  due  to  the  high  natural 
turbidity. 
 
Whilst nutrient levels and loadings within the Estuary are considered significant in UK terms (and thus 
have been scored as high for sensitivity and high for exposure), the high natural turbidity of the system 
negates these high levels, with algal productivity being generally low except in localised hotspots. Where 
these  do  occur,  nutrient  enrichment  may  lead  to  significant  shifts  in  community  composition  on/in 
subtidal  sandbanks  (see  section  5.2)  and  on/in  intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  (see  section  5.3),  but 
recoverability is likely to be high. Should there be a decrease in natural turbidity levels, then the overall 
associated masking effect would be lessened and there would be a higher risk of nutrient enrichment.  

 

134 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Changes in salinity 

 
 
At  the  present  time,  despite  the  high  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  scores  discussed  above,  the  high 
natural turbidity levels across most of the estuary lead to a conclusion that the estuary is not considered 
vulnerable to changes in nutrient loading. 
 
ix.  Changes in thermal regime 
The estuary feature is considered to have moderate sensitivity and moderate exposure  and therefore 
moderate vulnerability to changes in thermal regime  
 
Temperature can affect many biological, physical and chemical geochemical processes within the water 
column  including  stratification,  mixing  and  turbidity,  nutrients,  oxygenation,  salinity  and  pH.        For 
example,  activities  which  can  cause  short  or  longterm  changes  in  temperature  can  include  thermal 
discharges (eg from power station cooling waters and other discharges).  Thermal discharges are likely to 
be between 2 and 10 degrees above ambient temperature and a long term duration of changes may impact 
on the larval forms and breeding cycles of marine organisms.  
 
x. 
The estuary feature is considered to have moderate sensitivity and high exposure and therefore  high 
vulnerability to changes in salinity. 
 
Decreases  in  salinity  within  the  Estuary  are  likely  to  result  from  heavy  rain  events  and  associated 
land/waterfront  run-off  and  riverine  inputs.  The    vast    floodplain  and  catchment  area  of  the  Severn 
Estuary results in  annual extreme flooding events and prolonged periods of freshwater input the estuary 
so the exposure is considered to be high.  Localised salinity changes may also result around discharges. 
Certain  biotopes  associated  with  subtidal  sandbanks  occur  in  conditions  of  reduced  salinity  and  these 
biotopes are considered to be moderately vulnerable to any long-term increases in salinity levels. 
 
xi.  Changes in oxygenation 
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and 
therefore high vulnerability to changes in oxygenation. 
 
A cycle of changes in oxygenation occurs within the Severn as a result of both seasonal and  tidal cycles  
and is linked to fluctuating sediment regimes.  In addition  occasional, intermittent oxygen sags occur in 
low  salinity  regions  of  the  Severn  and  in  some  of  the  principal  rivers  feeding  the  Estuary.      These 
probably  originate  from  high  densities  of  suspended  solids  and  associated  particulate  organic  matter, 
perhaps  enhanced  by  discharge  outfalls.  Other  causes  include  maintenance  dredging,  aggregate 
extraction, spoil dumping, coastal farming and shipping.  
 
Oxygen-deficient  marine  areas  are  characterized  by  a  decline  in  the  number  and  diversity  of  species. 
Certain  communities  occurring  within  the  Estuarys  intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  are  moderately 
sensitive to decreases in dissolved oxygen levels .  However, recoverability of these areas should be rapid 
upon  return  to  normal  conditions.    The  fish  assemblage  is  also  likely  to  be  sensitive  to  decreases  in 
dissolved oxygen levels, although it is unclear what the level of sensitivity is at the present time. 
 
xii. 
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore 
high vulnerability to changes in microbial pathogens. 
 
Microbial pathogens are most likely to enter the Severns ecosystem by means of sewage discharges, be 
these from port facilities, recreational boating, shipping or the outfalls from sewage treatment works. For 
the majority of biological communities there is insufficient information available to be able to make an 
assessment of their sensitivity to microbial pathogens. Of the few known impacts, subtidal seagrass beds 
of Zostera marina are known to be highly sensitive to the marine fungus Labyrinthula macrocystis which 
causes wasting disease. The disease causes the death of leaves and, after 2-3 seasons, can lead to the 
death  of  regenerative  shoots,  rhizomes  and  the  loss  of  up  to  90%  of  the  population  and  its  associated 

Introduction of microbial pathogens

biotope. However, no information has been found which confirms the presence of the wasting disease in 
the Estuary.   
 
While no infomation has been found which confirms the presence of the wasting disease in the estuary, 
the potential significant consequences for one of this notable estuarine community in particular has lead 
to the conclusion that estuary is highly sensitive to microbial pathogens. The exposure is considered to be 
high  due to the high number of sewage discharges. 
 
xiii.  Introduction of non-native species 
The  estuary  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  moderate  exposure  and 
therefore high vulnerability to the introduction of non-native species. 
 
The saltmarsh cordgrass Spartina anglica is an invasive pioneer species whose rapid growth consolidates 
sediment, raises mudflats and reduces sediment availability elsewhere. It is regarded as being a potential 
threat  to  intertidal  beds  of  Zostera  noltei  in  particular.  However,  whilst  recognising  S.  anglica  as  an 
invasive species, it also has a role in saltmarsh formation and the community SM6 in which it features 
should be allowed to develop into other Atlantic Salt Meadow or transitional communities. The Japanese 
seaweed Sargassum muticum is another non-native species which is thought to compete for space with 
the subtidal seagrass Zostera marina, though evidence for actual competition is conflicting. The presence 
of  another  non-native,  the  slipper  limpet  Crepidula  fornicata,  in  large  numbers  may  alter  the  species 
composition within certain soft mud habitats leading to a decline in overall species richness. However, C. 
fornicata  has  yet  to  penetrate  the  Estuary,  possibly  due  to  the  strong  water  flows.  The  exposure  to 
introduction  of  non-natives  to  the  estuary  is  considered  to  be  moderate  because  of  the  considerable 
volume of ship traffic, including transport to and from the major ports at Cardiff, Newport and Bristol. 
 
xiv.  Selective extraction of species 
The  estuary  feature    is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  high    exposure  and 
therefore high vulnerability to the selective extraction of species. 
 
This category refers to the removal of key species within a biotope or of a prey species. Activities which 
occur within the Estuary which are likely to be implicated bait digging, fixed netting, commercial fishing, 
recreational  angling,  wildfowling  and  educational  visits.  Whilst  the  majority  of  biotopes  have  a  low 
sensitivity to such activities, intertidal Zostera noltei beds are highly sensitive to grazing by species of 
wildfowl. Significant amounts of dwarf eelgrass can be consumed by wildfowl, particularly during the 
autumn and winter months.  However as these grazers are also part of the natural estuarine ecosystem and 
designated features in their own right their impact is not judged to be detrimental.

These result from a range of activities known to occur in the vicinity of the sandbanks. Further details are

5.6.2.3  Vulnerability 
 
The subtidal sandbanks communities are moderately to highly vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
The  subtidal  sandbanks    feature    is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate 
exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to substratum loss.  
 
The physical loss of subtidal sandbanks will occur through the removal of material during maintenance 
dredging and aggregate extraction in particular. These activities, coupled with strong current flows, result 
in material being suspended in the water column and removed away from their point of origin. Removal 
of the substratum will lead to partial loss of faunal diversity, exposure of the underlying sediment and 
changes in the topography of the area. Recolonisation of the biotope might occur within a few months, 
but the biotope would be unlikely to be recognized until after six months. Cohesive mud and sandy mud 
communities are considered to be moderately sensitive to substratum loss.  
 
ii. 
The  subtidal  sandbanks    feature    is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate 
exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in suspended sediment. 
 
Increase  in  sediment  in  suspension  are  unlikely  to  cause  problems  unless  it  leads  to  smothering  (see 
smothering).   A decrease in suspended sediments may lead to increased light penetration  and changes in 
the sandbank communities.  
 
Activities  likely  to  result  in  changes  in  suspended  sediment  would  include  those  which  would  affect 
sediment availability or the water flow rate (coastal defences, development, construction and dredging).

iii.  Toxic contamination 
The subtidal sandbanks  feature  is currently considered to have moderate sensitivity and high exposure 
and  therefore  high  vulnerability  to  toxic  contamination.  (Note  that  there  is  currently  insufficient 
scientific information on the sensitivities of subtidal sandbank communities to radionuclides to determine 
their vulnerability). 
 
This  category  includes  contamination  from  synthetic  compounds  (including  pesticides  and  herbicides), 
non-synthetic compounds (including heavy metals) and hydrocarbons (oil related products). As a result of 
the domination of physical conditions within the Estuary, for the majority of biological communities there 
is  little  unequivocal  evidence  of  additional  impact  due  to  contaminants  across  the  Estuary  as  a  whole. 
Individual populations may have been impacted close to major discharges however. 
 
Moderately high levels of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in sediments across much of 
the Estuary (Langston et al., 2003). Generally speaking however, subtidal sediments are less likely to be 
at risk from oil spills than intertidal sediments unless oil dispersants are used or if wave action causes 
dispersion of oil into the water column and sediment mobility drives oil into the sediment. Certain species 
such as amphipods which occur within the Estuarys infralittoral mobile clean sand community have been 
found to be moderately sensitive to oil pollution. (See also section 5.1). 
Despite  the  presence  of  several  potential  sources  of  radionuclides  (Berkeley,  Oldbury  and  Hinkley 
Nuclear Power Plants, a manufacturer of radiopharmaceuticals in Cardiff and a number of other smaller 
sources) the accumulation of radionuclides in the Severn Estuary is generally low compared with samples 
from the Irish Sea. The exceptions to this are Tritium and Carbon 14, which have been found at locally at 
significant levels. This is thought to be related to discharges from the radiopharmaceutical company in 
Cardiff, for which remedial action is being taken. The exposure for subtidal sandbanks is therfore thought 
to be low. 
 
iv. 
The subtidal sandbanks  feature  is currently considered to have low sensitivity and high exposure and 
therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in nutrient loading   
 
Whilst nutrient levels and loadings within the Estuary are considered significant in UK terms the high 
natural  turbidity  of  the  system  negates  these  high  levels,  with  algal  productivity    being  generally  low 
except in localised hotspots. Where these do occur, nutrient enrichment may lead to significant shifts in 
community composition on/in subtidal sandbanks but recoverability is likely to be high. 
 
v. 
The subtidal sandbanks  feature  is currently considered to have moderate sensitivity and high exposure 
and therefore high vulnerability to changes in salinity. 
 
Aphelochaeta  marioni,  a  polychaete  worm  which  characterizes  the  shallow  sandbanks  biotope  of 
variable  salinity  infralittoral  mobile  sand,  is  very  tolerant  of  low  salinity  conditions  but  would  be 
moderately vulnerable to any long-term increases in salinity levels. This species has a wide distribution 
throughout the Estuary, being present on subtidal and intertidal sand habitats on both sides of the Estuary.  
 
vi.  Changes in oxygenation 
 
The subtidal sandbanks  feature  is currently considered to have low sensitivity and high exposure and 
therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in oxygenation. 
 
A cycle of changes in oxygenation occurs within the Severn as a result of both seasonal and  tidal cycles  
and is linked to fluctuating sediment regimes.  In addition  occasional, intermittent oxygen sags occur in 
low salinity regions of the Severn and in some of the principal rivers feeding the Estuary.  
 
Decreases in oxygenation levels can result from maintenance dredging, aggregate extraction, industrial 
effluent discharge, land/waterfront runoff and sewage discharge (Langston et al., 2003). Oxygen-deficient

Introduction of microbial pathogens 

 
marine areas are characterized by a decline in the number and diversity of species. Certain communities 
occurring  within  the  Estuarys  subtidal  sandbanks  are  moderately  sensitive  to  decreases  in  dissolved 
oxygen levels. However, recoverability of these areas should be rapid upon return to normal conditions. 
 
vii. 
The subtidal sandbanks  feature  is currently considered to have high sensitivity and high exposure and 
therefore high vulnerability to the introduction of microbial pathogens. 
 
Microbial pathogens are most likely to enter the Severns ecosystem by means of sewage discharges. For 
the majority of biological communities there is insufficient information available to be able to make an 
assessment of their sensitivity to microbial pathogens. However, some research has been undertaken on 
marine  bivalves,  several  species  of  which  occur  within  the  Estuarys  sandbanks.  Mass  mortalities  of 
bivalves  can  result  from  diseases  caused  by  bacteria, viruses  (over  20  have  been  described  for  marine 
bivalves) or protozoans. There is a greater likelihood of such events occurring in areas adjacent to outfalls 
than elsewhere. Recovery of populations is probable.

5.6.3  Mudflats and sandflats feature 
 
(Note  :  this  advice  is  also  relevant  to  the  Ramsar  Site  as  the  mudflats  and  sandflats  are  both  a 
subfeature  of  the  estuaries  feature  and  a  supporting  habitat  of  the  birds  species,  for  which  the 
Ramsar Site has been designated  refer also to section 5.8) 
 
5.6.3.1  Sensitivity 
 
The  mudflats  and  sandflats  and  their  associated  biological  communities  are  moderately  to  highly 
sensitive to:  
 
  physical loss  
  physical damage 
 
  non-toxic contamination 
  biological disturbance 
 
These  result  from  a  range  of  activities  known  to  occur  in  the  vicinity  of  the  mudflats  and  sandflats. 
Further details are provided in points i) to xiii) below, with details of the level of sensitivity set out in 
Table 22. 
 
5.6.3.2  Exposure 
 
The  mudflats  and  sandflats  and  their  associated  biological  communities  are  moderately  to  highly 
exposed to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  abrasion and physical disturbance 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.6.3.3  Vulnerability 
 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats communities are moderately to highly vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have high  sensitivity  and  high 
exposure and therefore high vulnerability to substratum loss. 
 
Areas of intertidal habitats will be lost as a direct result of land claim or developments, or indirectly as a 
consequence of changes to sedimentation processes (e.g. resulting from the construction of groynes or of 
seawalls). Consequently, there is moderate to high exposure of mudflats and sandflats to substratum loss. 
The  sediment  infauna  reside  in  the  uppermost  layers  of  the  substratum  and  the  removal  of  this  layer 
would  cause  a  major  decline  in  species  richness  as  they  would  have  been  removed  with  it.  Thus  the 
sensitivity of the biotopes in question is high. Fortunately, recovery of the community is also regarded as 
being high as recolonisation is likely following deposition of suitable substrata.

Smothering 

 
ii. 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature is considered to have moderate sensitivity and moderate 
exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to smothering  
 
Smothering of organisms is likely to occur as a result of the direct deposition of material on top of them 
and/or  on  their  habitat.  Examples  of  activities  causing  smothering  in  intertidal  areas  include  beach 
replenishment, port developments, archaeological activities, coastal farming, industrial effluent discharge, 
oil spills, land runoff including highways discharge and sewage discharge.  
 
iii.  Changes in suspended sediment  
The  intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  feature  feature  is  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and 
moderate exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in suspended sediment 
 
Changes  in  suspended  sediments  could  change  the  extent  and  nature  of  intertidal  habitats  including 
affecting estuary-wide erosion and accretion patterns.  Increase in sediment in suspension are unlikely to 
cause  problems  unless  it  leads  to  smothering  (see  smothering)  and  in  some  cases  the  invertebrate 
communities associated with the sediment may provide additional food resources for feeding birds.   A 
decrease in suspended sediments may lead to increased light penetration  and changes in the intertidal 
mud and sandflat communities.  
 
Activities  likely  to  result  in  changes  in  suspended  sediment  would  include  those  which  would  affect 
sediment availability or the water flow rate (coastal defences, development, construction and dredging).   
 
iv.  Changes in water flow rate 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have moderate sensitivity and 
high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in water flow rate. 
 
Increases or decreases to the water flow rate are likely to lead to, respectively, increased sediment erosion 
or  accretion  in  certain  areas.  Activities/structures  responsible  for  changing  the  water  flow  rate  include 
construction  activities,  groynes,  beach  replenishment,  sea  walls/breakwaters,  port  developments  and 
aggregate extraction.  
 
v. 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have high sensitivity and  high 
exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in wave exposure. 
 
Changes  in  wave  exposure  result  from  coastal  defence  structures  (groynes,  seawalls,  breakwaters  and 
beach  replenishment),  shipping  and  possibly  aggregate  extraction.  Increased  wave  action  will  disrupt 
feeding and burrowing, and reduce species abundance, richness and biomass. The strength of wave action 
determines the topography, steepness and shore width of the intertidal zone.  
 
vi.  Abrasion and physical disturbance  
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have moderate sensitivity and 
high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to physical disturbance and abrasion. 
 
The activities most likely to cause abrasion to mudflats and sandflats include beach replenishment, bait 
digging,  maintenance  dredging,  aggregate  extraction,  land-based  recreation  and  archaeology.  Boating, 
anchoring, trampling or the use of vehicles are also likely to cause physical disturbance, with compaction 
of the substratum being of particular concern. For example, the use of vehicles on mudflats or sandflats 
appears to have a potentially severe impact on gaper clams Mya arenaria. Large clams live in permanent 
burrows and are therefore susceptible to burrow collapse and sediment compaction through trampling and 
especially vehicle use. Another two key species found in muddy sand, the heart urchin Echinocardium 
cordatum and the razor shell Ensis ensis, are probably highly sensitive to physical disturbance. Recovery 
is likely to be moderate because, although the individual key species may recolonize an area within five 
years, several of the species are very long-lived and so the biotope may take longer to return to its original 
age structure and species diversity.

vii.  Toxic contamination 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have high sensitivity and high 
exposure  and  therefore  high  vulnerability  to  toxic  contamination  by  synthetic  and  non-synthetic 
compounds.  (Note  that  there  is  currently  insufficient  scientific  information  on  the  sensitivities  of 
communities  present  on/in  intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  to  radionuclides  to  determine  their 
vulnerability). 
 
This  category  includes  contamination  from  synthetic  compounds  (including  pesticides  and  herbicides), 
non-synthetic  compounds  (including  heavy  metals)  and  hydrocarbons  (oil  related  products).  Infaunal 
populations  present  within  intertidal  sediments  are  likely  to  have  been  impacted  close  to  major 
discharges,  with  a  number  of  synthetic  compounds  known  to  have  elevated  concentrations  locally 
(Langston et al.,2003). However, because of the energetic hydrodynamic regime in the Severn, and the 
resultant  high  turbidity,  there  is  considerable  mixing  and  redistribution  of  fines  and  their  associated 
contamination burden, resulting in a fairly homogenous distribution. 
 
Whilst the concentration of metals within the Estuarys sediments (cadmium, arsenic, chromium, silver, 
copper, zinc and nickel in particular) are commonly above interim sediment quality guidelines, these only 
occasionally exceed probable effects levels (Langston et al.,2003).. Contamination loadings of metals will 
be  highest  where  fine  particulates  predominate  (for  example  between  Avonmouth  and  Severn  Beach, 
Caldicot  Flats,  the  River  Parrett  and  outer  Bridgewater  Bay,  and  between  the  mouths  of  the  Usk  and 
Taff),  and  lowest  on  sands  (for  example  the  Middle  to  Welsh  Grounds,  and  Culver  Sands). 
Bioaccumulation of metals is known to occur widely in invertebrates, though the ecological significance 
is  still  uncertain.  Note  also  that  the  toxicity  of  metals  to  many  invertebrates  increases  with  decreased 
salinity and elevated temperature (Langston et al.,2003). Thus many benthic invertebrates living within 
their normal salinity range may be less susceptible to heavy metal pollution than those living in salinities 
near the lower limit of their salinity tolerance. 
 
Hydrocarbon compounds are present locally in elevated concentrations (Langston et al.,2003).. Sources 
include  a  combination  of  fossil  fuel  combustion,  shipping,  urban  run-off,  sewage  treatment  works  and 
various  point-source  and  diffuse  discharges  from  industrialised  areas.  Moderately  high  levels  of  poly-
aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  are  present  in  sediments  across  much  of  the  Estuary  (Langston  et 
al.,2003). 
 
Overall vulnerability to all toxic contamination is considered high (due to the exposure from sewage 
inputs being classed as high and also with moderate levels from industrial inputs etc.).  
Despite  the  presence  of  several  potential  sources  of  radionuclides  (Berkeley,  Oldbury  and  Hinkley 
Nuclear Power Plants, a manufacturer of radiopharmaceuticals in Cardiff and a number of other smaller 
sources) the accumulation of radionuclides in the Severn Estuary is generally low compared with samples 
from the Irish Sea. The exceptions to this are Tritium and Carbon 14, which have been found at locally at 
significant levels. This is thought to be related to discharges from the radiopharmaceutical company in 
Cardiff,  for  which  remedial  action  is  being  taken.  The  intertidal  mudlfats  and  sandflats  are  therefore 
thought to be moderately exposed to radionuclides (Langston et al, 2003). 
 
viii.  Changes in nutrient loading  
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have moderate  sensitivity and  
high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in nutrient loading. 
 
The most obvious sign of an increase in nutrient loading (or organic enrichment) on mudflats is the lush 
growth of green seaweeds on the surface. Such increases coupled with reduced oxygenation typically lead 
to anaerobic conditions predominating within the sediment. Moderate organic enrichment does provide 
food  which  can  enhance  species  diversity  but  with  greater  enrichment,  the  diversity  declines  and  the 
community becomes increasingly dominated by a few, pollution tolerant, opportunistic species such as 
the polychaete Capitella capitata. In sandier sediments where particle size is  greater, the effects of an 
increase in organic enrichment are less dramatic. However, the structure of the community is still likely to 
change from one dominated by suspension feeders to one favouring deposit feeders, accompanied by an 
increase in the abundance of opportunistic species and a decrease in species richness.   Note, however,

Changes in salinity 

 
that  the  high  natural  turbidity  of  the  system  negates  many  of  these  effects,  and  algal  productivity  is 
generally low except in localised hotspots.  
 
ix.  Changes in thermal regime 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have moderate sensitivity and 
moderate exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability  to changes in thermal regime 
 
Temperature can affect many biological, physical and chemical geochemical processes within the water 
column  including  stratification,  mixing  and  turbidity,  nutrients,  oxygenation,  salinity  and  pH.    For 
example,  activities  which  can  cause  short  or  longterm  changes  in  temperature  can  include  thermal 
discharges (eg from power station cooling waters and other discharges).  Thermal discharges are likely to 
be between 2 and 10 degrees above ambient temperature and a long term duration of changes may impact 
on the larval forms and breeding cycles of marine organisms.  
 
x. 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have low sensitivity and high 
exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability  to changes in salinity 
 
Decreases in salinity are likely to result from heavy rain events and associated land/waterfront run-off and 
riverine inputs.  Localised salinity changes may also result around discharges.   The  vast  floodplain and 
catchment area of the Severn Estuary results in  annual extreme flooding events and prolonged periods of 
freshwater input to the intertidal areas so the exposure is considered to be high. However the metabolism 
of intertidal communities cope with vast extremes of conditions which result from the dynamic nature of 
the estuarys tidal regime and so are considered to have low sensitivity.   
 
xi.  Changes in oxygenation 
The intertidal  mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have  low sensitivity and high 
exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability  to changes in oxygenation. 
 
A cycle of changes in oxygenation occurs within the Severn as a result of both seasonal and  tidal cycles  
and is linked to fluctuating sediment regimes.  In addition  occasional, intermittent oxygen sags occur in 
low salinity regions of the Severn and in some of the principal rivers feeding the Estuary.  
 
Decreases in oxygenation levels will result from maintenance dredging, aggregate extraction, industrial 
effluent  discharge,  land/waterfront  runoff  and  sewage  discharge.  Oxygen-deficient  marine  areas  are 
characterized by a decline in the number and diversity of species. Certain communities occurring within 
the Estuarys intertidal mudflats and sandflats are moderately sensitive to decreases in dissolved oxygen 
levels. However, recoverability of these areas should be rapid upon return to normal conditions.  
 
xii. 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have high sensitivity and high 
exposure and therefore high vulnerability to the introduction of microbial pathogens. 
 
Microbial pathogens are most likely to enter the Severns ecosystem by means of sewage discharges. For 
the majority of biological communities there is insufficient information available to be able to make an 
assessment of their sensitivity to microbial pathogens. However, some research has been undertaken on 
marine  bivalves,  several  species  of  which  occur  within  the  Estuarys  intertidal  sandbanks.  Mass 
mortalities of bivalves can result from diseases caused by bacteria, viruses (over 20 have been described 
for  marine  bivalves)  or  protozoans.  There  is  a  greater  likelihood  of  such  events  occurring  in  areas 
adjacent to outfalls than elsewhere. Recovery of populations is probable.  
 
xiii.  Introduction of non-native species 
The intertidal  mudflats and sandflats feature  is currently considered to have  high sensitivity and low 
exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to the introduction of non-native species.

The saltmarsh cordgrass Spartina anglica is an invasive pioneer species whose rapid growth consolidates 
sediment, raises mudflats and reduces sediment availability elsewhere. It is regarded as being a potential 
threat  to  intertidal  beds  of  Zostera  noltei  in  particular.  However,  whilst  recognising  S.  anglica  as  an 
invasive species, it also has a role in saltmarsh formation and the community SM6 in which it features 
should be allowed to develop into other Atlantic Salt Meadow or transitional communities. The presence 
of  another  non-native,  the  slipper  limpet  Crepidula  fornicata,  in  large  numbers  may  alter  the  species 
composition within certain soft mud habitats leading to a decline in overall species richness. However, C. 
fornicata has yet to penetrate the Estuary, possibly due to the strong water flows.  
 
 
Note, in relation to noise and visual disturbance, that while mudflats and sandflats communities have 
moderate exposure to both noise and visual disturbance, these habitats are not sensitive to these factors 
but they do provide a vitally important role as supporting habitats for waterfowl that use these areas for 
roosting and feeding and these are considered highly sensitive to both noise and visual disturbance  see 
sections  5.7.1  &  5.7.2).  So  while  the  habitats  themselves  have  low  vulnerability  their  dependant  bird 
species have high vulnerability.

(Note  :  this  advice  is  also  relevant  to  the  Ramsar  Site  as  the  Atlantic  saltmeadows  are  both  a 
subfeature  of  the  estuaries  feature  and  a  supporting  habitat  of  the  birds  species,  for  which  the 
Ramsar Site has been designated  refer also to section 5.8) 
 
5.6.4.1  Sensitivity 
 
The Atlantic salt meadow and its associated biological communities are moderately or highly sensitive 
to:  
 
  physical loss 
  physical damage 
 
  non-toxic contamination 
 
These result from a range of activities known to occur on or in the vicinity of the salt meadows. Further 
details are provided in points i) to xiii) below, with details of the level of sensitivity set out in Table 22. 
 
5.6.4.2  Exposure 
 
The Atlantic salt meadow and its associated biological communities are moderately to highly exposed 
to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  abrasion and physical disturbance  
 
  noise and visual disturbance 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.6.4.3  Vulnerability 
 
The saltmarsh communities are moderately to highly vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
The Atlantic salt meadows and their associated communities feature is currently considered to have high 
sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to substratum loss  
 
Saltmarshes, cordgrass and Salicornia are highly sensitive to physical loss. This can occur mostly through 
one-off  developments  such  as  infrastructure  construction  and  modification  involving  land  claim  and 
changes in land management and coastal farming, and also as a result of coastal squeeze. This is a process 
by which coastal features such as saltmarshes and Salicornia are eroded as they become trapped between 
man-made structures such as sea walls and rising sea levels. Where this occurs on saltmarshes, it may 
result  in  the  replacement  of  mid-marsh  communities  by  pioneer  saltmarsh  communities  or  through 
erosion changing saltmarsh to intertidal mud and sand. Changes to coastal processes may also affect the 
sediment budget of estuaries and reduce the supply of sediment to saltmarsh, Salicornia and cordgrass 
areas. Whilst some areas of the Estuary are subject to these pressures, others are not, yet it remains a real

Smothering 

 
threat as is reflected in the moderate to high exposure score. When combined with high sensitivity this 
leads to a high vulnerability.  
 
ii. 
The Atlantic salt meadows feature is considered to have high sensitivity and moderate exposure and 
therefore high vulnerability to smothering. 
 
Smothering of saltmarsh is likely to occur as a result of the direct deposition of material on the surface. 
This  can  happen  by  either  direct  deposition  of  materials  on  land  or  through  silt-laden  tides.  The 
saltmarshes of the Severn are subject to spring tides each year which can in some locations deposit a thick 
layer of sediment on the surface which can persist for some months.  Normally the level of this natural 
deposition is compatible with the speed of vertical accretion and growth of the saltmarsh. Higher levels of 
sediment  deposition  which  may  be  associated  with  development  activities  (increasing  sediment 
suspension)  can  cause  smothering  to  occur  resulting  in  loss  of  vegetation  or  shifts  in  community 
composition  and  zonation.    Examples  of  activities  likely  to  cause  smothering  from  tidal  deposition 
include  coastal  defence  works,  dredging,  construction  and  archaeological  works.  Examples  of  direct 
deposition are fly tipping and accumulation of tidal debris. 
 
iii.  Changes in suspended sediment 
The  Atlantic  salt  meadows  and  their  associated  communities  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have 
moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate  exposure  and  therefore  moderate  vulnerability  to  changes  in 
suspended sediment 
 
Changes in suspended sediments could change the extent and nature of saltmarsh communities and other 
intertidal habitats including affecting estuary-wide erosion and accretion patterns.  Increases in suspended 
sediment  are unlikely to cause problems unless it leads to smothering (see smothering).    
 
Activities  likely  to  result  in  changes  in  suspended  sediment  would  include  those  which  would  affect 
sediment availability or the water flow rate (coastal defences, development, construction and dredging).   
 
iv.   Desiccation and changes in emergence regime 
The Atlantic salt meadows and their associated communities feature is currently considered to have high 
sensitivity  and  low  exposure  and  therefore  moderate  vulnerability  to  desiccation  and  changes  in 
emergence regime 
 
Changes  in  the  emergence  regime  will  result  in  changes  in  the  time  habitats  or  species  spend  either 
covered in water or exposed to the air, one consequence of which is the desiccation (drying) of habitats 
and species.  Examples of activities which may induce these changes are the construction of coastal and 
flood defences and other  developments which change the tidal regime and water flow characteristics of 
the estuary. 
 
The  morphology, zonation and composition of saltmarshes are  determined by their position within the 
tidal  frame.  They  therefore  considered  highly  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  emergence  regime  and 
desiccation in particular.   
 
These changes occurring in saltmarshes may result in either the stranding and exposure of communities or 
lengthened periods of inundation and lack of drying out with consequent impacts on species composition 
of swards (through dieback and  shifts in community types)  and affecting their suitability for species 
dependant on them.  These changes may also cause the expansion of Spartina into both saltmarsh habitats 
and across adjacent mudflats. 
 
The size of the estuary means that most small scale activities will have limited impacts with only large 
scale or estuary-wide activities likely to be of concern and exposure to this operation is therefore 
currently considered as low. 
 
 

 

146 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Changes in water flow rate 

 
v. 
The  Atlantic  salt  meadows  and  their  associated  communities  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have 
moderate sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in water flow rate. 
 
A reduction in the rate of water flow over the saltmarsh will result in an increase in the deposition of 
sediment. The rate at which this occurs will depend on the sediment supply, the duration of the tidal cover 
and  the  extent  to  which  the  tidal  flow  is  impeded  by  the  vegetation  itself  to  facilitate  deposition. 
Saltmarsh communities actually require a degree of sediment deposition in order to survive and flourish 
and they have been assessed as having a low to moderate sensitivity. Exposure to changes in water flow 
rate on saltmarsh communities will vary throughout the Estuary.  
 
vi.  Changes in wave exposure 
The Atlantic salt meadows and their associated communities feature is currently considered to have high 
sensitivity and high  exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in wave exposure. 
 
Changes  in  wave  exposure  result  from  the  presence  of  coastal  defence  structures  (groynes,  seawalls, 
breakwaters), beach replenishment and possibly aggregate extraction. Increased wave action can have two 
opposing effects. On the one hand it is likely to lead to a greater amount of suspended sediment being 
carried  to  the  saltmarsh,  while  on  the  other  hand  the  greater  energy  regime  is  likely  to  prevent  the 
settlement  of  this  material  and  may  even  remove  material  from  the  saltmarsh  through  erosion  at  the 
saltmarsh edge. A decrease in wave action will lead to greater sediment deposition with the possibility of 
smothering. 
 
vii.  Abrasion and physical disturbance  
The  Atlantic  salt  meadows  and  their  associated  communities  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have 
moderate sensitivity and high  exposure and therefore high vulnerability to physical disturbance and 
abrasion. 
 
Physical  disturbance  or  abrasion  to  saltmarsh  communities  may  result  from  a  wide  range  of  activities 
including  recreational  usage  (both  land-based  and  water-based),  any  of  which  may  damage  individual 
saltmarsh plants or areas of saltmarsh. Trampling by foot, and particularly by off-road vehicles, causes 
localised  damage  which  may  impact  upon  the  ecological  structure  and  function  of  larger  areas,  and 
requiring  long-term  recovery.  Saltmarshes  are  also  sensitive  to  erosion  as  a  result  of  trampling  or 
overgrazing, with communities that support succulents such as Limonium spp. being very susceptible to 
any form of grazing. In addition, it is widely recognised that shipping and boating can increase saltmarsh 
erosion from their wash.  
 
viii.  Changes in grazing management 
The Atlantic salt meadows and their associated communities feature is currently considered to have high 
sensitivity and high  exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in grazing management. 
 
The  presence,  duration  and  intensity  of  grazing  management  can  alter  the  vegetation  composition  and 
structure  of  saltmarsh  habitats.  Abandonment  or  introduction  of  grazing  can  result  in  changes  in  the 
saltmarsh plant and animal communities which are important in their own right and which also provide 
food  resources  for  passage  and  wintering  birds.    Grazing  changes  may  also  affect  the  suitability  of 
saltmarsh  areas  as  resting  and  roosting  sites  for  birds  where  open  terrain  with  low  vegetation  is  an 
important factor. Changes may also affect the presence of specific  niches for scarce and notable plants.   
 
ix.  Toxic contamination 
The  Atlantic  salt  meadows  and  their  associated  communities  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have 
moderate to high sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to toxic contamination 
from both synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. 
 
Atlantic  salt  meadows,  cordgrass  swards  and  Salicornia  within  the  Estuary  are  considered  to  have  a 
moderate sensitivity to toxic contamination by synthetic compounds (which includes domestic/industrial 
effluent,  pesticides,  anti-foulant  paints  and  PCBs)  and  a  high  sensitivity  to  non-synthetic  compounds 

 

147 

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Changes in nutrient loading  

 
(which includes domestic/industrial effluent, heavy metals and hydrocarbons). Although saltmarsh plants 
may be reasonably tolerant of certain synthetic substances, they can bioaccumulate toxic compounds and 
act as sinks for them. This could have implications for wildfowl which feed on saltmarsh plants. 
Saltmarsh communities are also highly sensitive to oil and oil products, even at relatively low levels. This 
is mainly by virtue of their ability to trap sediments. Acute events, such as oil spills, can be particularly 
damaging to saltmarsh plants. Dispersants used to treat oil spills can also have a toxic effect on saltmarsh 
plants, sometimes to a greater degree that the spilled oil itself. Saltmarshes have been reported to recover 
from  chronic  oil  pollution,  where  denuded  of  vegetation,  within  ten  years,  although  recovery  depends 
largely on the degree to which oil is retained in the sediment and the clean up procedures used.  
 
x. 
The  Atlantic  salt  meadows  and  their  associated  communities  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have 
moderate  sensitivity  and  high    exposure  and  therefore  high  vulnerability  to  changes  in  nutrient 
loading. 
 
The  Estuarys  saltmarshes  and  associated  communities  are  thought  to  be  more  susceptible  to  nutrient 
enrichment than was previously realised (Deegan, L. A. et al. 2007), so they have been assessed as being 
of high sensitivity to increases in nutrient loading and/or organic enrichment. However, increased growth 
of  certain  seaweed  species  may  result  from  elevated  levels  of  nitrates  and  phosphates  and  cause  local 
smothering  which  is  known  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  glasswort  (Salicornia  spp.)  in  low  marsh 
communities.  In  addition,  the  species  composition  of  the  plants  on  the  saltmarsh  may  be  altered  by 
changes in nutrient loading leading to a change in the structure of the sward.  
 
xi.  Changes in salinity 
The  Atlantic  salt  meadows  and  their  associated  communities  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have 
moderate sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in salinity. 
  
Changes to the salinity of water flowing across the saltmarshes as a result of the tides are likely to occur  
following  heavy  rain  events  and  associated  land/waterfront  run-off  and  riverine  inputs.    The    vast  
floodplain  and  catchment  area  of  the  Severn  Estuary  results  in    annual  extreme  flooding  events  and 
prolonged periods of freshwater input to the intertidal areas so the exposure is considered to be high.  The 
botanical composition of the saltmarshes reflects salinity. The saltmarshes, while capable of tolerating a 
wide range of salinities, are considered moderately sensitive to changes in salinity particularly prolonged 
periods of change which can cause shifts in composition and zonation.   
 
xii.  Changes in oxygenation 
The Atlantic salt meadows and their associated communities feature is currently considered to have low 
sensitivity and high  exposure and  therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in oxygenation.  
 
A cycle of changes in oxygenation occurs within the Severn as a result of both seasonal and  tidal cycles  
and is linked to fluctuating sediment regimes.  In addition  occasional, intermittent oxygen sags occur in 
low salinity regions of the Severn and in some of the principal rivers feeding the Estuary.  
 
xiii.  Introduction of microbial pathogens 
The Atlantic salt meadows and their associated communities feature is currently considered to have low 
sensitivity and high  exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to the introduction of microbial 
pathogens 
 
For the majority of saltmarsh communities there is insufficient information available to be able to make 
an assessment of their sensitivity to microbial pathogens. 
 
Note, in relation to noise and visual disturbance, that while Atlantic salt meadows and their associated 
plant  communities  have  high  exposure  to  both  noise  and  visual  disturbance,  these  habitats  are  not 
sensitive to these factors but they do provide a vitally important role as supporting habitats for waterfowl 
that use these areas for roosting and feeding and these are considered highly sensitive to both noise and

visual disturbance  see sections 5.7.1 & 5.7.2).  So while the habitats themselves have low vulnerability 
their dependant bird species have high vulnerability.

5.6.5  Reefs feature 
 
5.6.5.1  Sensitivity 
 
The reefs and their associated biological communities are moderately to highly sensitive to: 

 

changes in suspended sediment 
toxic contamination(introduction of synthetic & non synthetic compounds) 
changes in nutrient loading  
changes in turbidity 
changes in salinity 
changes in oxygenation 
introduction of microbial pathogens 

  physical loss  
  physical damage 
 
These result from a range of activities. Note that there is currently insufficient scientific information to 
assess  the  degree  of  sensitivity  of  reefs  to  toxic  &  non-toxic  contamination  and  also  to  biological 
disturbance.  In  these  cases,  the  precautionary  principle  has  been  applied  with  a  moderate  level  of 
sensitivity being assumed until proven otherwise. Further details are provided in points i) to vii) below, 
with details of the level of sensitivity set out in Table 22. 
 
5.6.5.2  Exposure 
 
The reefs and associated biological communities are moderately to highly exposed to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  reefs  of  the  Severn  Estuary  are  biogenic  in  origin,  that  is,  they  are  built  by  a  concretion-forming 
organism  creating  elevated  structures.  The  organism  in  this  case  is  the  honeycomb  worm  Sabellaria 
alveolata.  These  reefs  occur  both  in  the  intertidal  (where  one  might  expect  to  find  them)  and,  most 
unusually, in the subtidal. Indeed, the Severn Estuary has the only extensive subtidal Sabellaria alveolata 
reef in Britain. There has been little research undertaken on these subtidal Sabellaria alveolata reefs, so 
the scientific information on their sensitivities is extremely limited. In the advice given here, much has 
been drawn on the information known about subtidal reefs of the closely related Sabellaria spinulosa. 
 
5.6.5.3  Vulnerability 
 
The reef communities are moderately to highly vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
The  reefs  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate  exposure    and 
therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in suspended sediment 
 
The  reduced  availability  of  sand,  essential  for  S.  alveolata  tube  building,  may  lead  to  the  reduced 
development of S. alveolata reefs and the decline of colonies.  Increase in suspended sediment is unlikely 
to  cause  problems  unless  it  leads  to  smothering  of  the  reef.      Activities  likely  to  result  in  changes  in 
suspended sediment would include those which would affect sediment availability or the water flow rate 
(coastal defences, development, construction and dredging).   
 
ii. 
The sensitivity of Sabellaria alveolata to toxic contaminants (domestic effluent, industrial effluent, heavy 
metals, hydrocarbons) entering the water is not known. The precautionary principle should therefore be 
applied.   
 
The  reefs  are  considered  to  have  high  exposure  to  both  synthetic  compounds  and  non-synthetic 
compounds (industrial effluents, heavy metals, hydrocarbons etc.),

Changes in salinity 

Changes in oxygenation 

 
The  reefs  are  therefore  moderately  vulnerable  to  the  introduction  of  synthetic  compounds  and    non-
synthetic compounds . 
 
iii.  Changes in nutrient loading  
The  reefs  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  low  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore 
moderate vulnerability to changes in nutrients.   
 
iv. 
The  reefs  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  low  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore 
moderate vulnerability to changes in salinity.  
 
Decreases  in  salinity  within  the  Estuary  are  likely  to  result  from  heavy  rain  events  and  associated 
land/waterfront  run-off  and  riverine  inputs.  The    vast    floodplain  and  catchment  area  of  the  Severn 
Estuary results in  annual extreme flooding events and prolonged periods of freshwater input the estuary 
so the exposure is considered to be high.   
 
v. 
The  reefs  feature  is  currently  considered  to  have  low  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore 
moderate vulnerability to changes in oxygenation.  
 
A cycle of changes in oxygenation occurs within the Severn as a result of both seasonal and  tidal cycles  
and is linked to fluctuating sediment regimes.  In addition  occasional, intermittent oxygen sags occur in 
low salinity regions of the Severn and in some of the principal rivers feeding the Estuary. 
 
vi. 
Microbial  pathogens  are  most  likely  to  enter  the  Severns  ecosystem  by  means  of  sewage  discharges. 
There  is  considered  to  be  high  exposure  to  microbial  pathogens  due  to  the  high  number  of  sewage 
discharges within the estuary.  
 
For the majority of biological communities there is insufficient information available to be able to make 
an  assessment  of  their  sensitivity  to  microbial  pathogens  and  there  is  currently  no  information  on  the 
sensitivity  of  Sabellaria  reefs  to  the  introduction  of  microbial  pathogens.    The  vulnerability  of    the 
Sabellaria reefs therefore remains unknown and the precautionary principle should be applied. 
 
vii. 
There is insufficient information on the sensitivity of reefs to introduction of non native species therefore 
the vulnerability is unknown.

5.6.6  Shad and lamprey features 

(Note  :  this  advice  is  also  relevant  to  the  Ramsar  Site  as  these  features  are  also  part  of  the 
assemblage of migratory fish species for which the Ramsar Site has been designated  refer also 
to section 5.8) 
 
Note  that  in  the  explanatory  text  that  follows,  the  term  shad  and  lamprey  refer  to  three  species  of 
migratory fish: twaite shad Alosa fallax, river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and sea lamprey Petromyzon 
marinus. 
 
As the populations of these migratory fish depend upon the freshwater habitats of the Rivers Usk, Wye 
and  Severn  as  well  as  the  estuarine  habitats  of  the  Severn  Estuary  during  their  lifetime,  the  advice 
presented here should be read in conjunction with the advice given for the River Usk SAC and the River 
Wye SAC (Management Plans and Conservation Objectives) available from CCW and Natural England 
on request. 
 
5.6.6.1  Sensitivity 
 
The shad and lamprey are considered sensitive to:   

 

 

 

  physical damage of their supporting habitats 
  non-physical disturbance 
 
  non-toxic contamination  
  biological disturbance 

toxic contamination 

These result from a range of activities known to occur within the Estuary on which further details are 
provided in points i) to xi) below.   
 
5.6.6.2  Exposure 
 
The  shad  and  lamprey  and  their  supporting  habitats  (whilst  within  the  Estuary)  are  moderately  to 
highly exposed to: 
 
  noise (part of noise and visual presence but latter not applicable) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

toxic contamination(introduction of synthetic & non synthetic compounds) 
changes in nutrient loading  
changes in thermal regime 
changes in turbidity 
changes in salinity 
changes in oxygenation 
introduction of microbial pathogens 
 

The  Estuary  provides  an  important  migration  route  for  these  three  rare  species,  to  and  from  their 
spawning and nursery grounds. Shad and lamprey are known to be present in coastal and estuarine waters 
throughout the year, though there remains a lack of information on these migratory species during the 
time  they  actually  spend  in  the  Estuary.  More  information  exists  for  the  rivers  where  they  migrate  to 
spawn and for the subsequent development of juveniles. Little is known of their biology and distribution 
during the marine part of their life cycle. 
In the assessments given below, it is assumed that these species would be capable of avoiding unsuitable 
areas,  that  is,  given  the  size  of  the  Estuary,  localized  activities  are  unlikely  to  adversely  affect  the 
population.

Toxic contamination 

Noise  (part of noise and visual presence but latter not applicable) 

 
5.6.6.3  Vulnerability 
 
Assessment  of  vulnerability  of  these  features  is  particularly  difficult  given  that  there  is  little  or  no  
information to enable the level of sensitivity to be established.  In line with the precautionary principle  
where there is moderate to high exposure the feature is considered vulnerable. 
 
Therefore the shad and lamprey are considered vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
Research  has  shown  that  shad  are  sensitive  to  vibration  which  can  arise  from  noisy  activities.  High 
frequency  vibration    (70    300Khtz)  can  be  barrier  to  migration  affecting  movement  both  up  and 
downstream  and  preventing  fish  reaching  spawning  areas.    In  some  circumstances  high  frequency 
vibrations can be fatal.   Vibration sources need to be assessed at the planning and consent stage and their 
potential impacts mitigated for, particularly during the key upstream migration phase. 
 
ii. 
A decrease in water quality within the Estuary may impede the migration of these fish to their spawning 
grounds in the rivers. Poor water quality may also affect their supply of food. Shad require a good supply 
of small crustacean prey species, especially mysids and small fish (particularly clupeids). At sea, river 
lamprey feed on a variety of small fish such as clupeids, whilst sea lamprey feed on larger fish including 
salmon. Pollution tolerance levels of shad and lamprey are unknown, but EA water quality policy is that 
levels  should  comply  with  targets  established  under  the  EA  Review  of  Consents  and  the  Water 
Framework Directive. 
  
iii.  Changes in nutrient loading  
It is possible that changes in nutrient levels may affect the food supply of the shad and lamprey. However, 
due to the natural high turbidity of the system and the volumes of water involved, it is thought that any 
effects would be minimal. 
.  
iv.   Changes in thermal regime 
Water temperature is believed to act as a trigger for the shad to migrate upstream to spawn in the rivers.  
There could be changes in water temperature in the vicinity of the power stations (eg  Hinkley Point  and 
Oldbury) and from other discharges 
 
v. 
It is not known whether the migratory fish are sensitive to changes in turbidity within the Estuary. Given 
the extremely high background levels of turbidity, it is unlikely that any changes in turbidity will have 
any significant impact on the shad and lamprey whilst in the estuarine waters.  
 
vi.  Changes in salinity 
Decreases  in  salinity  within  the  Estuary  are  likely  to  result  from  heavy  rain  events  and  associated 
land/waterfront  run-off  and  riverine  inputs.  The    vast    floodplain  and  catchment  area  of  the  Severn 
Estuary results in  annual extreme flooding events and prolonged periods of freshwater input the estuary 
so the exposure is considered to be high.  Within the Estuary, juvenile twaite shad prey on mysids feeding 
at the salt wedge near the head of the tide. It must be assumed that any activities affecting the salinity 
regime  of  the  estuary  would  in  turn  affect  the  distribution  of  these  prey  species,  which  may  have 
consequences for the shad.  
 
vii.  Changes in oxygenation 
A cycle of changes in oxygenation occurs within the Severn as a result of both seasonal and  tidal cycles  
and is linked to fluctuating sediment regimes.  In addition  occasional, intermittent oxygen sags occur in 
low  salinity  regions  of  the  Severn  and  in  some  of  the  principal  rivers  feeding  the  Estuary.  Shad  and 
lamprey  may  therefore  be  vulnerable  to  changes  in  oxygenation  given  the  high  exposure  to  changes 
resulting from operations within the Estuary.

viii.  Introduction of microbial pathogens 
There  is  insufficient  information  available  to  make  any  meaningful  assessment  on  the  introduction  of 
microbial pathogens to these species of fish, but there is potential for high exposure. 
 
Note regarding  changes in water flow rate  
It is thought unlikely that changes in water flow rate within the Estuary will affect these fish but they are 
likely to be affected (and therefore vulnerable) once in the rivers where water abstraction and freshwater 
flows may have more of a bearing.  
 
Note regarding  selective estraction of species 
After hatching in the rivers, young shad gradually move downstream into the upper estuary where they 
feed and mature until the end of their second summer before moving into coastal waters. Young shad feed 
on  estuarine invertebrates  while  adult shad  feed on mysids  and other  fish  (particularly  other  clupeids 
such as sprat and herring). Both river and sea lamprey spend several years of development in riverine 
mud and then, after a relatively rapid metamorphosis, migrate downstream to the estuary. River lamprey 
feed on a variety of estuarine fish, particularly herring, sprat and flounder. At sea, sea lamprey feed on 
larger fish including large salmon.   
Extraction of target species  -  it is reported that twaite shad are vulnerable to capture on cooling water 
intakes, particularly those associated with power stations, where the numbers killed can be considerable.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
 
5.7  Specific Advice on Operations for the Severn Estuary SPA 
 
This section provides information to help relate general advice to each of the specific interest features of the 
Severn  Estuary  SPA.  Where  specific  examples  are  given  they  are  provided  to  aid  understanding  of  possible 
impacts and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all relevant operations. 
 
This advice relates to the vulnerability of the interest features and supporting habitats of the Severn Estuary 
SPA as set out in Table 23. An explanation of the sensitivity of the interest features or supporting habitats 
follows with an explanation of their exposure and therefore their vulnerability to damage or disturbance from 
the listed categories of operations. This enables links between the categories of operation and the ecological 
requirements of the SPAs interest features (as set out in Section 2.2) to be made.  It should be noted that 
sensitivity scorings are a combination of whether the habitat itself is likely to be affected by a particular 
operation (which is drawn from the SAC scores in Table 22), in combination with an assessment as to whether 
the outcome is likely to affect the bird's use of that habitat.  
 
Note that this advice for the SPA supercedes that issued to ASERA in February 2005 following reassessment of 
exposure, sensitivity and vulnerability to take account of availability of new information in the Severn Estuary 
CHaMP and MarLIN sensitivities and following the more detailed analysis of impacts on the SAC estuarine 
habitats that are supporting habitats for the birds of the SPA.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
5.7.1  Internationally  important  populations  of  regularly  occurring  Annex  1 

species (Bewicks swan) 

  
(Note : this advice is also relevant to the Ramsar Sites internationally important population of waterfowl 
Bewicks swan feature and as part of the internationally important assemblage of waterfowl feature 
for which the Ramsar Site has been designated  refer also to section 5.8) 
 
5.7.1.1  Sensitivity 
 
The Annex 1 species is moderately to highly sensitive to : 
 
  Physical loss 
  Physical damage 
  Non-physical disturbance 
  Toxic contamination 
  Non- toxic contamination 
  Biological disturbance 
 
These result from a range of activities known to occur within the Estuary. Further details are provided in points 
i) to xii) below, with details of the level of sensitivity set out in Table 23.  
 
5.7.1.2  Exposure 
 
The Annex 1 species is moderately to highly exposed to: 
 
  Substratum loss and smothering 
  Changes in suspended sediment 
  Desiccation and changes in emergence regime 
  Changes in water flow 
  Changes in wave exposure 
  Changes in grazing regime 
  Noise and visual disturbance  
  Toxic contamination 
  Changes in nutrient loading  
  Changes in salinity 
  Changes in oxygenation 
 
 
 
5.7.1.3  Vulnerability 
 
The Annex 1 species is moderately to highly vulnerable to: 
 
i. 
The intertidal habitats and therefore the Bewicks Swan feature which these habitats support are considered to 
have  moderate  to  high  sensitivity  and  moderate  to  high  exposure  and  therefore  moderate  to  high 
vulnerability to physical loss (removal and smothering). 
 
The physical loss of areas of intertidal habitats may be caused directly through change of land use or indirectly 
as  a  consequence  of  changes  to  sedimentation  processes  (e.g.  coastal  defences)  as  well  as  via  the  effects  of 
smothering by artificial structures (e.g. jetties) or the disposal of spoils. Activities or developments resulting in 
physical loss of the intertidal supporting habitats are likely to reduce the availability of food and roosting habitat 
and thus be detrimental to the favourable condition of the SPA interest features including the Annex 1 species, 
Bewicks swan. The intertidal mudflats and sandflats and the saltmarsh are highly sensitive to removal by land 
reclamation and major construction activities.

Changes in suspended sediment 

Changes in wave exposure  

 
ii. 
It is thought unlikely that changes in the suspended sediment within the Estuary will affect the Bewicks Swan 
directly but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which they are dependant for 
roosting and feeding.  The saltmarshes and intertidal mudflats and sandflats are currently considered to have 
moderate sensitivity and moderate exposure and therefore moderate vulnerability to changes in suspended 
sediments .  (Refer also to sections 5.6.3 and 5.6.4).  Impacts on the suitability of these habitats may affect the 
long term survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or 
distribution. 
 
iii.   Desiccation and changes in emergence regime 
It is thought unlikely that changes in the emergence regime within the Estuary will affect the Bewicks Swan 
directly but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which they are dependant for 
roosting and feeding.  The saltmarshes are currently considered to have high sensitivity and low exposure and 
therefore  moderate  vulnerability  to  desiccation  and  changes  in  emergence  regime.    (Refer  also  to  section 
5.6.4.) Impacts on the suitability of these habitats may affect the long term survival of individuals (in terms of 
energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
iv.  Changes in water flow rate 
It is thought unlikely that changes in water flow rate within the Estuary will affect the Bewicks Swan directly 
but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which they are dependant for roosting 
and  feeding.    The  saltmarshes  and  intertidal  mudflats  and  sandflats  of  the  estuary  are  considered  to  have 
moderate  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  and  therefore  high  vulnerability  to  changes  in  water  flow  rate  . 
(Refer also to sections 5.6.3 and 5.6.4).    Impacts on the suitability of these habitats may affect the long term 
survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
v. 
It is thought unlikely that changes in wave exposure within the Estuary will affect the Bewicks Swan directly 
but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which they are dependant for roosting 
and feeding.  The saltmarshes and intertidal mudflats and sandflats of the estuary are considered to have high  
sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in water flow rate . (Refer also to 
sections 5.6.3 and 5.6.4).  .  Impacts on the extent and suitability of these habitats may affect the long term 
survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
vi. 
The Bewicks Swan feature, which is dependent on the saltmarsh habitats, is considered to have  high sensitivity 
and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in grazing management. 
 
The vegetation composition of saltmarsh habitats can be altered by changes in grazing management.  This can 
affect the palatability of the sward for grazing Bewicks swans and therefore affect the availability of adequate 
preferred feeding areas within the SPA.  There are critical areas for this species located at the Dumbles in the 
uppermost part of the estuary all of which are grazed.   
 
vii.  Noise and visual presence 
Overwintering birds are disturbed by sudden movements and sudden noises. This can displace the birds from 
their feeding grounds. Disturbance can prevent the birds from feeding and in response they either a) decrease 
their  energy  intake  at  their  present  (disturbed)  feeding  site  through  displacement  activity,  or  b)  move  to  an 
alternative  less  favoured  feeding  site.  Such  a  response  affects  energy  budgets  and  thus  survival.  There  is 
intermittent  disturbance  from  both  the  landward  and  seaward  side  of  the  site.  Bewicks  swans  are  mainly 
affected by disturbance from the landward side and any increase in disturbance should be avoided. At present 
the Annex 1 species are moderately vulnerable to noise and visual disturbance on the intertidal mudflats and 
sandflats and have a high vulnerability to this category of operation on the saltmarsh. 
 
viii.  Toxic contamination through the introduction of synthetic and/or non-synthetic compounds 
Waterfowl are subject to the accumulation of toxins through the food chain or through direct contact with toxic 
substances when roosting or feeding. Their ability to feed can also be affected by the abundance or change in 
palatability of their prey caused by toxic contamination. At the moment there is no evidence to show that this is 
the case, but the estuary is vulnerable to oil spills and there is a continuous discharge of toxins into the estuary,

some  of  which  bind  to  the  sediments.  This  is  an  area  which  requires  further  assessment  and  is  likely  to  be 
addressed by work arising from both the Water Framework Directive and ongoing Review of Consents by the 
Environment Agency. The Bewicks swans has a moderate vulnerability to toxic contamination. 
 
ix.  Changes in nutrient loading  
Changes in organic or nutrient loading can change the species composition of the plants on the saltmarsh and 
thus the structure of the sward. This could affect the palatability of the sward for grazing Bewicks swans and 
therefore affect the availability of adequate preferred feeding areas within the SPA.  There are critical areas for 
this species located at the Dumbles in the uppermost part of the estuary all of which are grazed.   
 
x. 
It is thought unlikely that changes in salinity within the Estuary will affect the Bewicks Swan feature directly 
but  such  changes  may  have  marked  effects  on  the  supporting  saltmarsh  habitats  on  which  this  species  are 
dependant for feeding. The  saltmarshes of the estuary are considered to have  moderate sensitivity and high 
exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in salinity.  Impacts on these habitats may affect the long 
term  survival  of  individuals  (in  terms  of  energy  and  competition)  or  alter  behavior  and  patterns  of  use  or 
distribution. 
 
xi. 
It  is  thought  unlikely  that  changes  in  oxygenation  within  the  Estuary  will  affect  the  Bewicks  Swan  feature 
directly but such changes may have an effect on the community composition of supporting saltmarsh habitats on 
which  this  species  are  dependant  for  feeding.  The    saltmarshes  of  the  estuary  are  considered  to  have    low 
sensitivity and high exposure and therefore moderate  vulnerability to changes in oxygenation.  Impacts on 
these  habitats  may  affect  the  long  term  survival  of  individuals  (in  terms  of  energy  and  competition)  or  alter 
behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
xii. 
Bewicks  swan  is  considered  to  have  low  sensitivity  and  high  exposure  (due  to  the  high  number  of  sewage 
discharges) and therefore moderate vulnerability to the introduction of microbial pathogens. 
 
Microbial pathogens are most likely to enter the Severns ecosystem by means of sewage discharges.  Bewicks 
swans  on  their  feeding  or  roosting  grounds  may  be  affected  by  direct  infection  by  pathogens  (  bacteria  or 
viruses) present in the water or river sediments and through the release of endo or exotoxins bacterial toxins.  
Infection  may  cause  mortality,  loss  of  condition  and  behavioural  changes  in  individuals  and  within  the 
population using the site through onward contamination.

species is moderately to highly sensitive to: 
 
  Physical loss 
  Physical damage 
  Non-physical disturbance 
  Toxic contamination

5.7.2.3  Vulnerability 
 
The Internationally important waterfowl assemblage including populations of regularly occurring migratory 
species has moderate to high vulnerability to: 

 

 

Substratum loss and smothering 

i. 
The  intertidal  habitats  and  therefore  the  waterfowl  assemblage  feature  which  these  habitats  support  are 
considered to have moderate to high sensitivity and moderate to high exposure and therefore moderate to 
high vulnerability to physical loss (substratum loss and smothering). 
 
The physical loss of areas of intertidal habitats may be caused directly through change of land use or indirectly 
as  a  consequence  of  changes  to  sedimentation  processes  (e.g.  coastal  defences)  as  well  as  via  the  effects  of 
smothering by artificial structures (e.g. jetties) or the disposal of spoils. Activities or developments resulting in

Changes in suspended sediment 

Changes in wave exposure   

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
physical loss of the intertidal supporting habitats are likely to reduce the availability of food and roosting habitat 
and  thus  be  detrimental  to  the  favourable  condition  of  the  SPA  interest  features  including  all  the  migratory 
species and waterfowl assemblage. The intertidal mudflats and sandflats and the saltmarsh are highly sensitive 
to removal by land reclamation and major construction activities.  
 
Eelgrass beds (which are a food source for some species of the assemblage) are being affected by siltation due 
to  changes  in  sediment  movement  after  construction  of  the  Second  Severn  Crossing  which  has  resulted  in 
smothering.  
 
ii. 
It  is  thought  unlikely  that  changes  in  the  suspended  sediment  within  the  Estuary  will  affect  the  waterfowl 
assemblage directly but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which they are 
dependant for roosting and feeding..  (Refer also to sections 5.6.1, 5.6.3 and 5.6.4).  The supporting habitats are 
all  are  currently  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate  exposure  and  therefore  moderate 
vulnerability to desiccation and changes in emergence regime.  Impacts on the suitability of these habitats may 
affect the long term survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns 
of use or distribution. 
 
iii.   Desiccation and changes in emergence regime 
It  is  thought  unlikely  that  changes  in  the  emergence  regime  within  the  Estuary  will  affect  the  waterfowl 
assemblage directly but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which they are 
dependant  for  roosting  and  feeding..    (Refer  also  to  sections  5.6.1,  5.6.3  and  5.6.4).    The  saltmarshes  are 
currently  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  low  exposure  and  therefore  moderate  vulnerability  to 
desiccation and changes in emergence regime.  Impacts on the suitability of these habitats may affect the long 
term  survival  of  individuals  (in  terms  of  energy  and  competition)  or  alter  behavior  and  patterns  of  use  or 
distribution. 
 
iv.  Changes in water flow rate 
It is thought unlikely that changes in water flow rate within the Estuary will affect the designated bird species of 
the assemblage directly but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which these 
species are dependant for roosting and feeding. All the supporting habitats are considered to have moderate 
sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in water flow rate . (Refer also to 
sections 5.6.1, 5.6.3 and 5.6.4).   Impacts on the suitability of these habitats may affect the long term survival of 
individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
v. 
It is thought unlikely that changes in wave exposure within the Estuary will affect the designated bird species of 
the assemblage directly but such changes may have marked effects on the supporting habitats on which these 
species  are  dependant  for  roosting  and  feeding.  All  the  supporting  habitats  are  considered  to  have  high 
sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in water flow rate . (Refer also to 
sections 5.6.1, 5.6.3 and 5.6.4).   Impacts on the extent and suitability of these habitats may affect the long term 
survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
vi.  Abrasion and physical disturbance  
Saltmarsh may be physically damaged from overgrazing or eroded when boats are moored on it and when paths 
are  worn  through  it  to  reach  moored  boats  on  foot  or  via  vehicles.  Currently  all  supporting  habitats  are 
considered to be moderately vulnerable to abrasion.   Intertidal habitats are highly sensitive to damage by direct 
and indirect effects of aggregate dredging. The intertidal mudflats and sandflats and the shingle and rocky shore 
are therefore considered highly vulnerable to selective extraction. 
 
vii. 
The  waterfowl  assemblage  which  is  in  part  dependant  on  the  saltmarsh  habitats  is  considered  to  have   high 
sensitivity and high exposure and therefore high vulnerability to changes in grazing management.  
 
The vegetation composition of saltmarsh habitats can be altered by changes in grazing management.  This can 
affect  the  palatability  of  the  sward  for  grazing  wildfowl  and  availability  of  invertebrate  food  sources  and 
therefore affect the availability of adequate preferred feeding areas within the SPA.  Grazing changes may also 

Changes in grazing management

Changes in nutrient loading 

 
affect  the  suitability    saltmarsh  areas  as  resting  and  roosting  sites  for  birds  where  open  terrain  with  low 
vegetation is an important factor. 
 
viii.  Noise or visual disturbance 
Overwintering  birds  are  disturbed  by  sudden  movements  and  sudden  noises.  This  can  have  the  effect  of 
displacing the birds from their feeding grounds. Disturbance can prevent the birds from feeding and in response 
they either a) decrease their energy intake at their present (disturbed) feeding site through displacement activity, 
or b) move to an alternative less favoured feeding site. Such a response affects energy budgets and thus survival. 
There  is  intermittent  disturbance  to  the  internationally  important  migratory  species  and  the  waterfowl 
assemblage from both the landward and seaward side of the site which has increased in recent years, due to the 
estuary  becoming  more  populated  and  the  development  of  all  weather  recreational  pursuits.  All  supporting 
habitats are currently highly vulnerable to noise and visual disturbance. 
 
ix.  Toxic contamination through the introduction of synthetic and/or non-synthetic compounds 
Waterfowl are subject to the accumulation of toxins through the food chain or through direct contact with toxic 
substances when roosting or feeding. Their ability to feed can also be affected by the abundance or change in 
palatability of their prey caused by toxic contamination. At the moment there is no evidence to show that this is 
the case on the Severn Estuary, but the estuary is vulnerable to oil spills and there is a continuous discharge of 
toxins into the estuary, some of which bind to the sediments. This is an area that requires further assessment. 
The intertidal mudflats and sandflats and the saltmarsh are currently highly vulnerable to the introduction of 
synthetic and non-synthetic compounds. 
 
x. 
Changes in organic or nutrient loading can change the species composition of the plants on the saltmarsh and 
thus the structure of the sward. Increases in nutrients can cause excessive algal growth on the mudflats, denying 
the birds access to their invertebrate prey and changing the invertebrate species composition in the sediment. 
However, high nutrient loads can also be beneficial to some species of birds by increasing the density and size 
of prey items. Though the water quality has been improved in recent years there are still local areas of concern. 
On balance, any increase in nutrient loading should be avoided. At present the intertidal mudflats and sandflats 
are moderately vulnerable to this category of operation. 
 
xi.  Changes in thermal regime 
It  is  thought  unlikely  that  changes  in  the  thermal  regime  within  the  Estuary  will  affect  the  designated  bird 
species of the assemblage directly but such changes may have marked effects on the community composition of 
supporting habitats on which these species are dependant for feeding. The intertidal mudflats and sandflats of 
the  estuary  are  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate  exposure  and  therefore  moderate 
vulnerability  to  changes  in  thermal  regime.    Impacts  on  these  habitats  may  affect  the  long  term  survival  of 
individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
xii. 
It is thought unlikely that changes in salinity within the Estuary will affect the waterfowl  assemblage feature 
directly  but  such  changes  may  have  marked  effects  on  the  supporting  habitats  on  which  these  species  are 
dependant for feeding. The  saltmarshes, intertidal mudfalts and sand flats and hard substrate habitats (rocky 
shores) of the estuary are considered to have  low to moderate sensitivity and high exposure and therefore 
moderate  to  high  vulnerability  to  changes  in  salinity.    Impacts  on  these  habitats  may  affect  the  long  term 
survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns of use or distribution. 
 
xiii. 
It  is  thought  unlikely  that  changes  in  oxygenation  within  the  Estuary  will  affect  the  waterfowl    assemblage 
feature  directly  but  such  changes  may  have  marked  effects  on  the  community  composition  of  supporting 
habitats on which these species are dependant for feeding. The  saltmarshes, intertidal mudfalts and sand flats 
and  hard  substrate  habitats  (rocky  shores)    of  the  estuary  are  considered  to  have  low  sensitivity  and  high 
exposure and therefore moderate  vulnerability to changes in oxygenation.  Impacts on these habitats may 
affect the long term survival of individuals (in terms of energy and competition) or alter behavior and patterns 
of use or distribution.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

Introduction of non-native species 

Introduction of microbial pathogens 

 
xiv. 
The bird assemblage is considered to have low to high sensitivity and high exposure (due to the high number 
of sewage discharges) and therefore moderate vulnerability to the introduction of microbial pathogens. 
 
Microbial  pathogens  are  most  likely  to  enter  the  Severns  ecosystem  by  means  of  sewage  discharges.  
Waterfowl may be affected by microbial pathogens (bacteria or viruses) on their feeding or roosting grounds 
and are considered to be particularly highly exposed when feeding and roosting on the intertidal mudflats and 
sandflats  and  hard  substrate  habitats  where  there  may  be  bioaccumulation  of  pathogens  within  food  sources 
(filter feeding organisms).  Birds may also be affected by direct infection by pathogens present in the water or 
river sediments and through the release of endo or exotoxins bacterial toxins.  Infection may cause mortality, 
loss  of  condition  and  behavioural  changes  in  individuals  and  within  the  population  using  the  site  through 
onward contamination.  
 
xv. 
The  birds  assemblage  is  considered  to  have  high  sensitivity  and  low  exposure  and  therefore  moderate 
vulnerability to the  introduction of non native species.  
 
The  saltmarsh  cordgrass  Spartina  anglica  is  an  invasive  pioneer  species  whose  rapid  growth  consolidates 
sediment,  raises  mudflats  and  reduces  sediment  availability  elsewhere.  This  expansion  can  affect  areas  of 
intertidal  habitats  (mud  and  sandflats  and  hard  substrate  habitats)  which  are  key  habitats  for  roosting  and 
feeding birds.  Such expansion is regarded as being a potential threat to intertidal beds of eelgrass Zostera noltei 
in particular which are a food source for some species within the assemblage (Wigeon and European white-
fronted goose).  However, whilst recognising S. anglica as an invasive species, it also has a role in saltmarsh 
formation and the community SM6 in which it features should be allowed to develop into other Atlantic Salt 
Meadow or transitional communities which are also of value as feeding and roosting habitats for birds within 
the assemblage.  
 
The  presence  of  another  non-native,  the  slipper  limpet  Crepidula  fornicata,  in  large  numbers  may  alter  the 
species  composition  within  certain  soft  mud  habitats  leading  to  a  decline  in  overall  species  richness  and 
consequent implications on food availability for feeding birds. However, C. fornicata has yet to penetrate the 
Estuary, possibly due to the strong water flows.  
 
xvi.  Selective extraction of species  
The  birds  assemblage  is  considered  to  have  moderate  sensitivity  and  moderate  exposure  and  therefore 
moderate vulnerability to the selective extraction of species. 
 
Wildfowling is carried out all around the estuary. It is believed that there is currently no direct detrimental effect 
on  the  overall  bird  populations  but  wildfowling  is  one  of  many  activities  that  may  be  contributing  (through 
disturbance) to the decline in some species on the Severn.  Continuing monitoring and regulation of wildfowling 
is achieved by the countyside agencies and through the management of wildfowling by a British Association of 
Shooting and Conservation (BASC) affiliated associations, applying the BASC wildfowlers code of conduct.  
 
Bait digging is also carried out in localised areas of the mid and outer estuary. Extensive areas of digging can 
change the availability of prey in the sediment as the area needs a period of recovery and recolonisation. There 
is currently no evidence that existing levels of activity is detrimental to the birds on the European Marine Site. 
 
The removal of strandline vegetation by beach cleaning removes an important habitat for invertebrates, as well 
as many of the invertebrates themselves, reducing the quantity and variety of prey available to the birds.  Much 
of  the  saltmarsh  is  managed  by  grazing  and  changes  in  management  can  alter  the  availability  of  prey  and 
suitability of roosting sites.

Severn Estuary SAC, SPA and Ramsar Site: Regulation 33 Advice from CCW and Natural England, June 2009 

 
5.8  Specific Advice on Operations for the Severn Estuary Ramsar Site 
 
Separate advice for the Ramsar Site features has not been produced here as it repeats the advice given in the 
previous  sections  (5.6  and  5.7)  for  the  SAC  and  SPA  respectively  due  to  the  overlapping  nature  of  the 
Ramsar  features.    The  following  table  therefore  cross  references  the  features  of  these  designations  and 
provides a direct reference to the section where advice relevant to the Ramsar features can be found.
