Interfaces to the physical layer

The physical layer (layer 1) is the lowest layer in the OSI Reference Model and it supports all functions required for the
transmission of bit streams on the physical medium.
The physical layer interfaces the Medium Access Control (MAC) Layer and the Radio Resource Control (RRC) Layer
as depicted in figure 1.

Interface to MAC

The physical layer interfaces the MAC entity of layer 2. Communication between the Physical Layer and MAC is in an
abstract way performed by means of PHY-primitives defined which do not constrain implementations.
NOTE:

The terms physical layer and layer 1, will be used synonymously in this description.

The PHY-primitives exchanged between the physical layer and the data link layer provide the following functions:
-

transfer of transport blocks over the radio interface;

-

indicate the status of the layer 1 to layer 2.

4.2

Interface to RRC

The physical layer interfaces the RRC entity of layer 3 in the UE and in the network.
Communication is performed in an abstract way by means of CPHY-primitives. They do not constrain implementations.
The CPHY-primitives exchanged between the physical layer and the Network layer provide the following function:
-

control of the configuration of the physical layer.

The currently identified exchange of information across that interface has only a local significance to the UE or
Network.

Services and functions of the physical layer

5.1

General

The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The access to these services is through the use of
transport channels via the MAC sub-layer. The characteristics of a transport channel are defined by its transport format
(or format set), specifying the physical layer processing to be applied to the transport channel in question, such as
convolutional channel coding and interleaving, and any service-specific rate matching as needed.
The physical layer operates exactly according to the L1 radio frame timing. A transport block is defined as the data
accepted by the physical layer to be jointly CRC protected. The transmission block timing is then tied exactly to the TTI
timing, e.g. every transmission block is generated precisely every TTI.
A UE can set up multiple transport channels simultaneously, each having own transport characteristics (e.g. offering
different error correction capability). Each transport channel can be used for information stream transfer of one radio
bearer or for layer 2 and higher layer signalling messages.
The multiplexing of transport channels onto the same or different physical channels is carried out by L1. Except for HSDSCH the Transport Format Combination Indication field (TFCI) shall uniquely identify the transport format used by
each transport channel of the Coded Composite Transport Channel within the current radio frame.
In case of HS-DSCH the identification of the transport format and channelisation codes is realised with the Transport
Format and Resource Indication field (TFRI) on an associated shared control channel.

5.2

Overview of L1 functions

The physical layer performs the following main functions:
-

FEC encoding/decoding of transport channels;

-

measurements and indication to higher layers (e.g. FER, SIR, interference power, transmission power, etcâ¦);

-

macrodiversity distribution/combining and soft handover execution;

-

error detection on transport channels;

-

multiplexing of transport channels and demultiplexing of coded composite transport channels;

-

rate matching;

-

mapping of coded composite transport channels on physical channels;

-

modulation and spreading/demodulation and despreading of physical channels;

-

frequency and time (chip, bit, slot, frame) synchronisation;

-

closed-loop power control;

-

power weighting and combining of physical channels;

-

RF processing;

-

support of Uplink Synchronisation as defined in [5] (TDD only);

-

timing advance on uplink channels (TDD only).

L1 interactions with L2 retransmission functionality

Provided that the RLC PDUs are mapped one-to-one onto the Transport Blocks, Error indication may be provided by
L1 to L2. For that purpose, the L1 CRC can be used for individual error indication of each RLC PDU.
The L1 CRC may serve multiple purposes:
-

error indication for uplink macro diversity selection combining (L1);

-

error indication for each erroneous Transport Block in transparent and unacknowledged mode RLC;

-

quality indication;

-

error indication for each erroneous Transport Block in acknowledged mode RLC.

Regardless of the result of the CRC check, all Transport Blocks are delivered to L2 along with the associated error
indications for transport channel other than HS-DSCH. In case of HS-DSCH an error indication is provided to L2 in
case of CRC failure.
In case of HS-DSCH retransmissions of Transport Blocks may be requested before transport blocks are delivered to L2.

Uplink models

Figure 2 shows models of the UE's physical layer in the uplink for both FDD and TDD mode. It shows the models for
DCH, RACH and USCH (TDD only). Some restriction exist for the use of different types of transport channel at the
same time, these restrictions are described in the clause "UE Simultaneous Physical Channel combinations". More
details can be found in [3] and [4].

USCH is for TDD only.
Figure 2: Model of the UE's physical layer - uplink

The DCH model shows that one or several DCHs can be processed and multiplexed together by the same coding and
multiplexing unit. The detailed functions of the coding and multiplexing unit are not defined in the present document
but in [3] and [4]. The single output data stream from the coding and multiplexing unit is denoted Coded Composite
Transport Channel (CCTrCH).
The bits on a CCTrCH Data Stream can be mapped on the same Physical Channel and should have the same C/I
requirement.
On the downlink, multiple CCTrCH can be used simultaneously with one UE. In the case of FDD, only one fast power
control loop is necessary for these different CCtrCH, but the different CCtrCH can have different C/I requirements to
provide different QoS on the mapped Transport Channels. In the case of TDD, different power control loops can be
applied for different CCTrCH. One physical channel can only have bits coming from the same CCTrCH.
On the uplink and in the case of FDD, only one CCTrCH can be used simultaneously. On the uplink and in the case of
TDD, multiple CCTrCH can be used simultaneously.
When multiple CCTrCH are used by one UE, one or several TFCI can be used, but each CCTrCH has only zero or one
corresponding TFCI. In the case of FDD, these different words are mapped on the same DPCCH. In the case of TDD,
these different TFCIs can be mapped on different DPCH.
The data stream of the CCTrCH is fed to a data demultiplexing/splitting unit that demultiplexes/splits the CCTrCH's
data stream onto one or several Physical Channel Data Streams.
The current configuration of the coding and multiplexing unit is either signalled to, or optionally blindly detected by,
the network for each 10 ms frame. If the configuration is signalled, it is represented by the Transport Format
Combination Indicator (TFCI) bits. Note that the TFCI signalling only consists of pointing out the current transport
format combination within the already configured transport format combination set. In the uplink there is only one
TFCI representing the current transport formats on all DCHs of one CCTrCH simultaneously. In FDD mode, the
physical channel data stream carrying the TFCI is mapped onto the physical channel carrying the power control bits and
the pilot. In TDD mode the TFCI is time multiplexed onto the same physical channel(s) as the DCHs. The exact
locations and coding of the TFCI are signalled by higher layers.
The DCH and USCH have the possibility to perform Timing Advance in TDD mode.
The model for the RACH case shows that RACH is a common type transport channel in the uplink. RACHs are always
mapped one-to-one onto physical channels (PRACHs), i.e. there is no physical layer multiplexing of RACHs, and there
can only be one RACH TrCH and no other TrCH in a RACH CCTrCH. Service multiplexing is handled by the MAC
layer. In one cell several RACHs/PRACHs may be configured. If more than one PRACH is configured in a cell, the UE
performs PRACH selection as specified in [4].
In FDD, the RACHs mapped to the PRACHs may all employ the same Transport Format and Transport Format
Combination Sets, respectively. It is however also possible that individual RACH Transport Format Sets are applied on
each available RACH/PRACH.
In TDD, there is no TFCI transmitted in the burst, and therefore each RACH is configured with a single transport
format within its TFS. The RACHs mapped to the PRACHs may all employ the same Transport Format. It is however
also possible that individual RACH Transport Formats are applied on each available RACH/PRACH combination.
The available pairs of RACH and PRACHs and their parameters are indicated in system information. In FDD mode, the
various PRACHs are distinguished either by employing different preamble scrambling codes, or by using a common
scrambling code but distinct (non-overlapping) partitions of available signatures and available subchannels. In TDD
mode, the various PRACHs are distinguished either by employing different timeslots, or by using a common timeslot
but distinct (non-overlapping) partitions of available channelisation codes and available subchannels. Examples of
RACH/PRACH configurations are given in [6].
In FDD in case of a configured HS-DSCH one physical channel (HS-DPCCH) is configured for the reporting of HSDSCH transport block acknowledgement / negative acknowledgement and channel quality indicator. In TDD in case of
a configured HS-DSCH a shared physical channel (HS-SICH) is configured for the reporting of HS-DSCH transport
block acknowledgement / negative acknowledgement, channel quality indicator and transmit power control symbols.

Figure 4: Model of the UE's physical layer â downlink TDD mode
For the DCH case, the mapping between DCHs and physical channel data streams works in the same way as for the
uplink. Note however, that the number of DCHs, the coding and multiplexing etc. may be different in uplink and
downlink.
In the FDD mode, the differences are mainly due to the soft and softer handover. Further, the pilot, TPC bits and TFCI
are time multiplexed onto the same physical channel(s) as the DCHs. Further, the definition of physical channel data
stream is somewhat different from the uplink. In TDD mode the TFCI is time multiplexed onto the same physical
channel(s) as the DCHs. The exact locations and coding of the TFCI are signalled by higher layers.
Note that it is logically one and the same physical data stream in the active set of cells, even though physically there is
one stream for each cell. The same processing and multiplexing is done in each cell. The only difference between the
cells is the actual codes, and these codes correspond to the same spreading factor.

3GPP

Release 5

17

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

The physical channels carrying the same physical channel data stream are combined in the UE receiver, excluding the
pilot, and in some cases the TPC bits. TPC bits received on certain physical channels may be combined provided that
UTRAN has informed the UE that the TPC information on these channels is identical.
A PCH and one or several FACH can be encoded and multiplexed together forming a CCTrCH. Similarly as in the
DCH model there is one TFCI for each CCTrCH for indication of the transport formats used on each PCH and FACH.
The PCH is associated with a separate physical channel carrying page indicators (PIs) which are used to trigger UE
reception of the physical channel that carries PCH. A FACH or a PCH can also be individually mapped onto a separate
physical channel. The BCH is always mapped onto one physical channel without any multiplexing with other transport
channels, and there can only be one BCH TrCH and no other TrCH in a BCH CCTrCH.
In the TDD mode a CCTrCh carrying PCH and one or several FACH can be multiplexed onto one or several physical
channel data streams.
For each HS-DSCH TTI, each HS-SCCH carries HS-DSCH-related downlink signalling for one UE. The following
information is carried on the HS-SCCH:
-

Transport Format and Resource Indicator (TFRI);

-

Hybrid-ARQ-related Information (HARQ information);

-

UE Identity via a UE specific CRC;

-

HS-SCCH Cyclic Sequence Number (HCSN) for TDD.

In addition, for the case of 1.28 Mcps TDD, the HS-SCCH also carries Transmit Power Control and Synchronisation
Shift symbols.

Formats and configurations for L1 data transfer

7.1

General concepts about Transport Channels

Layer 2 is responsible for the mapping of data onto L1 via the L1/L2 interface that is formed by the transport channels.
In order to describe how the mapping is performed and how it is controlled, some definitions and terms are required.
The required definitions are given in the following subclauses. Note that the definitions are generic for all transport
channel types, i.e. not only for DCHs.
All Transport Channels are defined as unidirectional (i.e. uplink or downlink). This means that a UE can have
simultaneously (depending on the services and the state of the UE) one or several transport channels in the downlink,
and one or more Transport Channel in the uplink.

7.1.1

Transport Block

This is the basic unit exchanged between L1 and MAC, for L1 processing.
Layer 1 adds a CRC for each Transport Block.

7.1.2

Transport Block Set

This is defined as a set of Transport Blocks, which are exchanged between L1 and MAC at the same time instance using
the same transport channel.
In case of HS-DSCH the Transport Block Set consists of one Transport Block only.

7.1.3

Transport Block Size

This is defined as the number of bits in a Transport Block. The Transport Block Size is always fixed within a given
Transport Block Set, i.e. all Transport Blocks within a Transport Block Set are equally sized.

3GPP

Release 5

7.1.4

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

Transport Block Set Size

This is defined as the number of bits in a Transport Block Set.

7.1.5

Transmission Time Interval

This is defined as the inter-arrival time of Transport Block Sets, and is equal to the periodicity at which a Transport
Block Set is transferred by the physical layer on the radio interface. It is always a multiple of the minimum interleaving
period (e.g. 10ms, the length of one Radio Frame). The MAC delivers one Transport Block Set to the physical layer
every TTI.
Figure 6 shows an example where Transport Block Sets, at certain time instances, are exchanged between MAC and L1
via three parallel transport channels. Each Transport Block Set consists of a number of Transport Blocks. The
Transmission Time Interval, i.e. the time between consecutive deliveries of data between MAC and L1, is also
illustrated.

Transport Format

This subclause applies to transport channel types other than HS-DSCH.
This is defined as a format offered by L1 to MAC (and vice versa) for the delivery of a Transport Block Set during a
Transmission Time Interval on a Transport Channel. The Transport Format constitutes of two parts â one dynamic part
and one semi-static part.

3GPP

Release 5

19

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

Attributes of the dynamic part are:
-

Transport Block Size;

-

Transport Block Set Size;

-

Transmission Time Interval (optional dynamic attribute for TDD only);

Attributes of the semi-static part are:
-

Transmission Time Interval (mandatory for FDD, optional for the dynamic part of TDD NRT bearers);

-

error protection scheme to apply:

-

-

type of error protection, turbo code, convolutional code or no channel coding (TDD only);

-

coding rate;

-

static rate matching parameter;

size of CRC.

In the following example, the Transmission Time Interval is seen as a semi-static part.
EXAMPLE:
Dynamic part: {320 bits, 640 bits}, Semi-static part: {10ms, convolutional coding only, static rate matching
parameter = 1}.
An empty Transport Format is defined as a Transport Format that has Block Set Size equal to zero.
For the two realisations of an empty Transport Format, see clause 11.

7.1.6a

Transport Format for HS-DSCH

This is defined as a format offered by L1 to MAC (and vice versa) for the delivery of a transport block during a
Transmission Time Interval on a Transport Channel. The Transport Format consists of three parts â one dynamic part,
one semi-static part and one static part.
The Transport Format for HS-DSCH is always explicitly signalled. There is no support of blind transport format
detection.
Attributes of the dynamic part are:
-

Transport block size (same as Transport block set size);

-

Redundancy version/Constellation;

-

Modulation scheme.

Attributes of the semi-static part are:
-

no semi-static attributes are defined.

Attributes of the static part are:
-

Transmission time interval. The Transmission time interval is fixed to 2ms in FDD, 10ms in 3.84 Mcps TDD and
5ms in 1.28 Mcps TDD.

-

error protection scheme to apply:
-

type of error protection is turbo coding;

-

coding rate is 1/3;

-

size of CRC is 24 bits.

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

Transport Format Set

This is defined as the set of Transport Formats associated to a Transport Channel.
The semi-static parts of all Transport Formats are the same within a Transport Format Set.
Effectively the Transport Block Size and Transport Block Set Size form the instantaneous bit rate on the Transport
Channel. Variable bit rate on a Transport Channel may, depending on the type of service, which is mapped onto the
transport channel, be achieved by changing between each Transmission Time Interval one of the following:
1. the Transport Block Set Size only (not applicable for HS-DSCH);
2. both the Transport Block Size and the Transport Block Set Size
Example 1 for DCHs:
-

dynamic part: {20 bits, 20 bits}; {40 bits, 40 bits}; {80 bits, 80 bits}; {160 bits, 160 bits}.

-

Semi-static part: {10ms, Convolutional coding only, static rate matching parameter = 1}

Example 2 for DCHs:
-

dynamic part: {320 bits, 320 bits}; {320 bits, 640 bits}; {320 bits, 1 280 bits}.

-

Semi-static part: {10ms, Convolutional coding only, static rate matching parameter = 2}.

Example 3 for HS-DSCH:
-

dynamic part: {320 bits, 320 bits, Redundancy version 1, QPSK}; {640, 640, Redundancy version 1, QPSK};
{1280, 1280, Redundancy version 2, 16QAM}.

-

static part: See subclause 7.1.6a.

The first example may correspond to a Transport Channel carrying a speech service, requiring blocks delivered on a
constant time basis. In the second example, which illustrates the situation where a non-real time service is carried by the
Transport Channel, the number of blocks delivered per Transmission Time Interval varies between the different
Transport Formats within the Transport Format Set. Referring to figure 6, the Transport Block Size is varied on DCH1
and DCH2. That is, a Transport Format Set where the dynamic part has a variable Transport Block Size has been
assigned for DCH1. On DCH3 it is instead only the Transport Block Set Size that is varied. That is, the dynamic parts
of the corresponding Transport Format Sets only include variable Transport Block Set Sizes.

7.1.8

Transport Format Combination

The layer 1 multiplexes one or several Transport Channels, and for each Transport Channel, there exists a list of
transport formats (Transport Format Set) which are applicable. Nevertheless, at a given point of time, not all
combinations may be submitted to layer 1 but only a subset, the Transport Format Combination. This is defined as an
authorised combination of the combination of currently valid Transport Formats that can be submitted simultaneously to
the layer 1 for transmission on a Coded Composite Transport Channel of a UE, i.e. containing one Transport Format
from each Transport Channel.
EXAMPLE:
DCH1:
Dynamic part: {20 bits, 20 bits}, Semi-static part: {10ms, Convolutional coding only, static rate matching
parameter = 2};
DCH2:
Dynamic part: {320 bits, 1 280 bits}, Semi-static part: {10ms, Convolutional coding only, static rate matching
parameter = 3};
DCH3:
Dynamic part: {320 bits, 320 bits}, Semi-static part: {40ms, Turbo coding, static rate matching parameter = 2}.
An empty Transport Format Combination is defined as a Transport Format Combination that is only made up of empty
Transport Formats.

3GPP

Release 5

7.1.9

21

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

Transport Format Combination Set

This is defined as a set of Transport Format Combinations on a Coded Composite Transport Channel.
EXAMPLE for DCHs:
-

-

dynamic part:
-

combination 1: DCH1: {20 bits, 20 bits}, DCH2: {320 bits, 1280 bits}, DCH3: {320 bits, 320 bits};

-

combination 2: DCH1: {40 bits, 40 bits}, DCH2: {320 bits, 1280 bits}, DCH3: {320 bits, 320 bits};

-

combination 3: DCH1: {160 bits, 160 bits}, DCH2: {320 bits, 320 bits}, DCH3: {320 bits, 320 bits}

semi-static part:
-

DCH1: {10ms, Convolutional coding only, static rate matching parameter = 1};

-

DCH2: {10ms, Convolutional coding only, static rate matching parameter = 1};

-

DCH3: {40ms, Turbo coding, static rate matching parameter = 2}.

The Transport Format Combination Set is what is given to MAC for control. However, the assignment of the Transport
Format Combination Set is done by L3. When mapping data onto L1, MAC chooses between the different Transport
Format Combinations given in the Transport Format Combination Set. Since it is only the dynamic part that differ
between the Transport format Combinations, it is in fact only the dynamic part that MAC has any control over.
The semi-static part, together with the target value for the L1 closed loop power control, correspond to the service
attributes:
-

quality (e.g. BER);

-

transfer delay.

These service attributes are then offered by L1. However, it is L3 that guarantees that the L1 services are fulfilled since
it is in charge of controlling the L1 configuration, i.e. the setting of the semi-static part of the Transport Formats.
Furthermore, L3 controls the target for the L1 closed loop power control through the outer loop power control (which
actually is a quality control rather than a power control).
Note that a Transport Format Combination Set need not contain all possible Transport Format Combinations that can be
formed by Transport Format Sets of the corresponding Transport Channels. It is only the allowed combinations that are
included. Thereby a maximum total bit rate of all transport channels of a Code Composite Transport Channel can be set
appropriately. That can be achieved by only allowing Transport Format Combinations for which the included Transport
Formats (one for each Transport Channel) do not correspond to high bit rates simultaneously.
The selection of Transport Format Combinations can be seen as a fast part of the radio resource control. The dedication
of these fast parts of the radio resource control to MAC, close to L1, means that the flexible variable rate scheme
provided by L1 can be fully utilised. These parts of the radio resource control should be distinguished from the slower
parts, which are handled by L3. Thereby the bit rate can be changed very fast, without any need for L3 signalling.

7.1.10

Transport Format Indicator (TFI)

The TFI is a label for a specific transport format within a transport format set. It is used in the inter-layer
communication between MAC and L1 each time a transport block set is exchanged between the two layers on a
transport channel.
When the DSCH is associated with a DCH, the TFI of the DSCH also indicates the physical channel (i.e. the
channelisation code) of the DSCH that has to be listened to by the UE.

7.1.11

Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI)

This is a representation of the current Transport Format Combination.

3GPP

Release 5

22

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

There is a one-to-one correspondence between a certain value of the TFCI and a certain Transport Format Combination.
The TFCI is used in order to inform the receiving side of the currently valid Transport Format Combination, and hence
how to decode, de-multiplex and deliver the received data on the appropriate Transport Channels. The TFCI is not used
for the HS-DSCH.
MAC indicates the TFI to Layer 1 at each delivery of Transport Block Sets on each Transport Channel. Layer 1 then
builds the TFCI from the TFIs of all parallel transport channels of the UE , processes the Transport Blocks
appropriately and appends the TFCI to the physical control signalling. Through the detection of the TFCI the receiving
side is able to identify the Transport Format Combination. For FDD, in case of limited Transport Format Combination
Sets the TFCI signalling may be omitted, instead relying on blind detection. Nevertheless, from the assigned Transport
Format Combinations, the receiving side has all information it needs in order to decode the information and transfer it
to MAC on the appropriate Transport Channels.
The multiplexing and exact rate matching patterns follow predefined rules and may therefore be derived (given the
Transport Format Combinations) by transmitter and receiver without signalling over the radio interface.
When the meaning of the TFCI field needs to be reconfigured, two procedures can be used depending on the level of
reconfiguration:
-

complete reconfiguration of TFCI: in this procedure all TFCI values are reinitialised and new values are
defined instead. The complete reconfiguration requires an explicit synchronisation between the UE and UTRAN
regarding when the reconfiguration becomes valid.

-

incremental reconfiguration of TFCI: in this procedures, a part of the TFCI values before and after the
reconfiguration remain identical (note that this must be true for at least a TFCI that carry the signalling
connection). This procedure supports addition, removal or redefinition of TFCI values. This procedure does not
require an explicit execution time. This procedure may imply the loss of some user-plane data.

7.1.12

Rate matching

Two levels of rate matching are defined on the radio interface:
-

a static rate matching per Transport Channel. The static rate matching is part of the semi-static attributes of the
Transport Channel. Static rate matching is not applicable to HS-DSCH;

-

a dynamic rate matching per CCTrCH. The dynamic rate matching adjusts the size of the physical layer data
payload to the physical channel as requested by RRC.

The static rate matching and the dynamic rate matching to be applied by the physical layer are indicated by RRC to the
physical layer.
In FDD, RRC is also responsible for configuring the physical layer on whether:
-

Blind Rate Detection or TFCI is used;

-

dynamic rate matching is applied or not on the downlink.

7.1.13

HARQ information

Hybrid ARQ is defined for HS-DSCH. With the help of the HARQ information the UE is enabled to identify the
process being used for the transport block that is received on the HS-DSCH. The HARQ information also includes
information that indicates whether a new data block is transmitted for the first time or a retransmission. Furthermore it
is used to decode the received data correctly.

7.1.14

Transport Format and Resource Indication (TFRI)

The TFRI includes information about the dynamic part of the HS-DSCH transport format, including transport block set
size and modulation scheme. The TFRI also includes information about the set of physical channels (channelisation
codes) onto which HS-DSCH is mapped in the corresponding HS-DSCH TTI.

Types of Transport Channels

A general classification of transport channels is into two groups:
-

common channels; and

-

dedicated channels (where the UEs can be unambiguously identified by the physical channel, i.e. code and
frequency).

Common transport channel types are:
1. Random Access Channel(s) (RACH) characterised by:
-

existence in uplink only;

-

limited data field;

-

collision risk;

-

open loop power control.

2. Forward Access Channel(s) (FACH) characterised by:
-

existence in downlink only;

-

possibility to use slow power control;

-

possibility to change rate fast (each 10ms); and

-

lack of inner loop power control.

3. Broadcast Channel (BCH) characterised by:
-

existence in downlink only;

-

low fixed bit rate; and

-

requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell.

4. Paging Channel (PCH) characterised by:
-

existence in downlink only;

-

association with a physical layer signal, the Page Indicator, to support efficient sleep mode procedures; and

-

requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell.

5. Downlink Shared Channel(s) (DSCH) characterised by:
-

7.3

Compressed Mode

Compressed Mode is defined as the mechanism whereby certain idle periods are created in radio frames so that the UE
can perform measurements during these periods (more details can be found in [3]).
Compressed Mode is obtained by layer 2 using transport channels provided by the layer 1 as follows:
-

compressed mode is controlled by the RRC layer, which configures the layer 2 and the physical layer;

-

the number of occurrences of compressed frames is controlled by RRC, and can be modified by RRC signalling;

-

it is under the responsibility of the layer 2 if necessary and if possible to either buffer some layer 2 PDUs
(typically at the RLC layer for NRT services) or to rate-adapt the data flow (similarly to GSM) so that there is no
loss of data because of compressed mode. This will be service dependent and controlled by the RRC layer.

For measurements in compressed mode, a transmission gap pattern sequence is defined. A transmission gap pattern
sequence consists of alternating transmission gap patterns 1 and 2, and each of these patterns in turn consists of one or
two transmission gaps. The transmission gap pattern structure, position and repetition are defined with physical channel
parameters described in [6]. In addition, the UTRAN configures compressed mode pattern sequences with the following
parameters:
-

TGMP: Transmission Gap pattern sequence Measurement Purpose: This parameter defines the purpose this
transmission gap pattern sequence is intended for. The following values are used:

3GPP

Release 5

-

25

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

-

for TDD measurements, one compressed mode pattern sequence can be configured with purpose 'TDD
measurement',

-

for FDD measurements, one compressed mode pattern sequence can be configured with purpose 'FDD
measurement',

-

for GSM measurements, three simultaneous compressed mode pattern sequences can be configured with
purposes 'GSM carrier RSSI measurement', 'Initial BSIC identification' and 'BSIC re-confirmation',

TGPSI: Transmission Gap Pattern Sequence Identifier selects the compressed mode pattern sequence for which
the parameters are to be set. The range of TGPSI is [1 to <MaxTGPS>].

The UE shall support a total number of simultaneous compressed mode pattern sequences, which is determined by the
UE's capability to support each of the measurement types categorised by the TGMP. For example, a UE supporting
FDD and GSM shall support four simultaneous compressed mode pattern sequences and a UE supporting FDD and
TDD shall support two simultaneous compressed mode pattern sequences.
When using simultaneous pattern sequences, it is the responsibility of the NW to ensure that the compressed mode gaps
do not overlap and are not scheduled to overlap the same frame. Gaps exceeding the maximum gap length shall not be
processed by the UE and shall interpreted as a faulty message. If the UE detects overlapping gaps, it shall process the
gap from the pattern sequence having the lowest TGPSI.

UE Simultaneous Physical Channels combinations

This clause describes the requirements from the UE to send and receive on multiple Transport Channels, which are
mapped on different physical channels simultaneously depending on the service capabilities and requirements. The

Comment

The maximum channel bit rate that can be
supported is dependent on the UE radio
access capabilities.
The PCH is included when the UE needs to
receive paging on the SCCPCH.
The reception of (one or more FACH + PCH)
is to enable the reception of broadcast
services on the CTCH, mapped to one of the
FACH.
Simultaneous reception of PCCPCH and
SCCPCH is only needed at occurrences when
the UE needs to read system information on
BCH while being in CELL_FACH state, i.e.
continuous reception of both PCCPCH and
SCCPCH at the same time is not required.
The requirement holds for PCCPCH and
SCCPCH sent in different cells or in the same
cell.

Measurements provided by the physical layer

One of the key services provided by the physical layer is the measurement of various quantities, which are used to
trigger or perform a multitude of functions. Both the UE and the UTRAN are required to perform a variety of
measurements. The standard will not specify the method to perform these measurements or stipulate that the list of
measurements provided in this clause must all be performed. While some of the measurements are critical to the
functioning of the network and are mandatory for delivering the basic functionality (e.g., handover measurements,
power control measurements), others may be used by the network operators in optimising the network (e.g., radio
environment).
Measurements may be made periodically and reported to the upper layers or may be event-triggered (e.g., primary
CCPCH becomes better than the previous best primary CCPCH). Another reporting strategy may combine the event
triggered and the periodical approach (e.g. falling of link quality below a certain threshold initiates periodical reporting).
The measurements are tightly coupled with the service primitives in that the primitives' parameters may constitute some
of the measurements.
The list and frequency of measurements, which the physical layer reports to higher layers, is described in this clause.
The detailed definition of measurement control and abilities is contained in [6] for FDD and [11] for TDD. The
measurement performance requirements together with accuracy, range and mapping is specified in [9] for TDD and in
[10] for FDD.
The measurement quantities measured by the physical layer shall be such that the following principles are applied:
-

for handover measurements, the decoding of parameters on the BCCH logical channel of monitored
neighbouring cells, should not, in general, be needed for calculating the measurement result. If there is a need to
adjust the measurement result with parameters broadcast on the PCCPCH, these parameters shall be provided by
the UTRAN in inband measurement control messages. There may be some exceptions to this rule;
EXAMPLE:
It may be necessary to decode the SFN of the measured neighbouring cell for time difference measurements.

-

9.1

in idle mode or in RRC connected mode using common Transport Channels, the UE shall be able to monitor
cells for cell reselection, without being required to frequently decode parameters on the BCCH logical channel of
the monitored neighbouring cells. The decoding frequency of these parameters, set by the cell reselection
algorithm, should be such that UE standby times are not significantly decreased.

Model of physical layer measurements

This subclause describes a model for how the physical layer measurements are performed. This model applies both to
the UE and Node B measurements. This model sets the requirement on the behaviour of the measurement elaboration
and reporting performed by L1 as well as filtering controlled by higher layers. It is not meant to be a requirement for
implementation as long as the performance requirements in [9] and [10] are fulfilled.
The measurement model for physical layer measurements is represented in the figure 7.

Release 5

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

-

A: measurements (samples) internal to the physical layer in support to the measurements to be provided to
higher layers;

-

Layer 1 filtering: internal layer 1 filtering of the inputs measured at point A. Exact filtering is implementation
dependant. How the measurements are actually executed in the physical layer by an implementation (inputs A
and Layer 1 filtering) in not constrained by the standard i.e. the model does not state a specific sampling rate or
even if the sampling is periodic or not. What the standard specifies in [9] and [10] is the performance objective
and measurement period at point B in the model. The performance objectives for the physical layer
measurements are specified in [9] and [10];

-

B: A measurement reported by layer 1 after layer 1 filtering. The reporting rate at point B shall be sufficient to
meet the performance objectives as defined in [9] and [10];

-

Layer 3 filtering: Filtering performed on the measurements provided at point B. The behaviour of the Layer 3
filters are standardised and the configuration of the layer 3 filters is provided by RRC signalling (UE
measurements) or NBAP signalling (Node B measurements). Each filtered result at point C shall correspond to a
Layer 3 filtering performed using a reporting period equal to one measurement period at point B;

-

C: A measurement after processing in the layer 3 filter. The reporting rate is identical to the reporting rate at
point B and is therefore also measurement type specific. Although this is not shown in the figure, one
measurement can be used by a multiplicity of evaluation of reporting criteria;

-

Evaluation of reporting criteria: This checks whether actual measurement reporting is necessary at point D
i.e. whether a message need to be sent to higher layers on the radio interface or Iub interface. The evaluation can
be based on more than one flow of measurements at reference point C e.g. to compare between different
measurements. This is illustrated by input C, C', etc. The UE shall evaluate the reporting criteria at least every
time a new measurement result is reported at point C, C' etc. The reporting criteria are standardised and the
configuration is provided by RRC signalling (UE measurements) or NBAP signalling (Node B measurements).
Examples are periodic reporting and event based reporting. In case periodical reporting is in use and if the
reporting interval is different from the filtering period defined by the layer 3 filter, the last measurement result
filtered by the L3 filter shall be used as the value of the reported result. In case event triggered reporting is in use
and the reporting criteria is fulfilled, the last measurement result filtered by the L3 filter shall be used as the
value for reporting criteria evaluation and as the value of the reported result. This applies also for any additional
measurements that shall be reported as a consequence of the event;

-

D: a measurement report information (message) sent on the radio or Iub interface.

Primitives of the physical layer

The Physical layer interacts with other entities as illustrated in figure 1. The interactions with the MAC layer and the
RRC layer are shown in terms of primitives where the primitives represent the logical exchange of information and
control between the physical layer and higher layers. They do not specify or constrain implementations. The (adjacent)
layers connect to each other through Service Access Points (SAPs). Primitives, therefore, are the conveyers of the
information exchange and control through SAPs.
Four types of primitives are used for the present document, as follows.
-

REQUEST (REQ):
-

-

INDICATION (IND):
-

-

This type is used by a lower layer providing a service to notify its higher layer of activities concerning that
higher layer.

RESPONSE (RESP):
-

-

This type is used when a higher layer is requesting a service from a lower layer.

This type is used by a higher layer providing the indicated service to respond to its lower layer that the
activity has been completed.

CONFIRM (CNF):
-

This type is used by a lower layer providing the requested service to confirm to the higher layer that the
activity has been completed.

The primitives defined below are for local communications between MAC and L1, as well as RRC and L1 in the same
protocol stack.
For the physical layer two sets of primitives are defined:
-

Primitives between layer 1 and 2:

Transport block transmission

Data exchange between MAC and the physical layer, is defined in terms of Transport Block Sets (TBS). On a Transport
Channel, one Transport Block Set can be transmitted for every Transmission Time Interval. A TBS consists of one or
several Transport Blocks which shall be numbered 1,â¦, m,â¦ ,M and is delivered in the order of the index m. A
Transport Block is identical with a MAC PDU. A Transport Block (MAC PDU) is a bit string ordered from first to last,
where the first and last bits are numbered 1 and A, respectively, where A is the number of bits of the Transport Block. In
case of Transport Block size=0 bit and Mâ 0, only parity bits as given by the CRC size are sent and A=0. This case is

3GPP

Release 5

55

3GPP TS 25.302 V5.9.0 (2005-09)

one realisation of an empty Transport Format. The second realisation of an empty Transport Format is represented by
M=0 (no transport block). In this case, no parity bits are transmitted for this Transport Format.
The bits of the mth Transport Block in a TBS, are denoted as aim1, â¦, aimA for a Transport Channel identified by an
index i (cf. [3] and [4]).

NOTE 1: The maximum size of the Transport Block has been chosen so as to avoid any need for segmentation in
the physical layer into sub-blocks (segmentation should be avoided in the physical layer).
NOTE 2: Code rate is fixed to 1/3 in case of Turbo coding.
NOTE 3: All channels using the same resources as the BCH (i.e. the same timeslot and code, e.g. in a multiframe
pattern) have to use different Transport Formats than the BCH to allow the identification of the BCH
channel by physical layer parameters. Due to the differing parameters, decoding of other transport
channels than BCH will result in an erroneous CRC.

Annex B (informative):
Example of Transport format attributes for AMR speech
codec
The support for the AMR speech codec is exemplified below. On the radio interface, one Transport Channel is
established per class of bits i.e. DCH A for class A, DCH B for class B and DCH C for class C. Each DCH has a
different transport format combination set which corresponds to the necessary protection for the corresponding class of
bits as well as the size of these class of bits for the various AMR codec modes.
With this principle, the AMR codec mode which is used during a given TTI can be deduced from the format of the
transport channels DCH A, DCH B and DCH C for that particular TTI.
Note that a similar principle can also be applied for other source codecs e.g. other speech codecs or video codecs.
An example of transport channel description for each class of bits is given in table B.1.
