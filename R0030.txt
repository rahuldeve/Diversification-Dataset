one-way fare between the destination on your ticket/pass and your 
final destination.
Changing Your Terminal A flat fee of $3.00 will be charged  
on-board trains when you present a ticket/pass printed with Hoboken 
Terminal for travel to/from New York or points in New Jersey ($4.25 
from Denville through Hackettstown stations). For travel to/from 
stations on the Main, Bergen County, Pascack Valley or Port Jervis lines, 
refer to your lines timetable for the proper change-in-terminal fee.
Traveling to Newark Liberty International Airport One-way 
tickets with the airport as the destination include an access fee of 
$5.50 and are encoded to allow passage through the fare gates at the 
station. Please be sure to retain your ticket for use in the fare gates. 
Children 11 and under are not required to pay the access fee. The 
access fee is currently waived on monthly passes with Newark Liberty 
International Airport as the origin or destination. Tickets pur-
chased aboard trains require that you pay the access fee upon arrival 
at the airport station for fare gate passage. 
Commuter Tax Benefit Programs Federal tax policy allows 
customers to set aside pre-tax dollars to save on commuting costs. 
Employers also save. Visit njtransit.com/taxbenefits. 
travel flexibility
You can use your NJ TRANSIT rail pass on light rail or bus! 
Rail passes are imprinted with a bus-zone number. You can use that rail 
pass for any light rail trip, or for bus trips up to the number of zones 
indicated on the pass simply by presenting it to the bus operator or light 
rail fare enforcement officer. Rail tickets purchased for transfer between 
the Hoboken and Newark division rail lines via Secaucus will be valid 
for use on the Newark Light Rail at no additional cost for connections 
between Newark Broad Street and Newark Penn stations only, with a 
single ticket. Rail one-way, round-trip and 10-trip tickets are not valid on 
other light rail or bus lines.
