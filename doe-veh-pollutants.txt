Vehicle Emissions

Sources of Vehicle Emissions
The power to move a motor vehicle comes from burning fuel in an engine.
Pollution from vehicles comes from the by-products of this combustion process.
In addition, volatile organic compounds (VOC) escape through fuel evaporation.
As vehicle exhaust systems have improved, evaporative emissions have become a
larger component of total vehicle VOC emissions.

Exhaust Emissions

The combustion process results in emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOC), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), particulate matter (PM), and carbon monox-
ide (CO), which are released from the tailpipe while a vehicle is operating.
Exhaust emissions occur during two modes:

Cold Start - Starting and driving a vehicle the first few minutes results in higher emissions
because the emissions control equipment has not yet reached its optimal operating tempera-
ture.

Running Exhaust Emissions - Pollutants are emitted from the vehicles tailpipe during
driving and idling after the vehicle is warmed up.

Evaporative Emissions

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) also escape into the air through fuel evapora-
tion. With todays efficient exhaust emission controls and gasoline formulations,
evaporative losses can account, on hot days, for a majority of the total VOC
pollution from current model cars. Evaporative emissions occur in several ways:

Running Losses - The hot engine and exhaust system can vaporize gasoline while the
vehicle is running.

Hot soak (Cooling Down) - The engine remains hot for a period of time after the
vehicle is turned off, and gasoline evaporation continues when the car is parked while cooling
down.

Diurnal Emissions (Emissions while Parked and Engine is Cool)- Even
when the vehicle is parked for long periods of time, gasoline evaporation occurs as the
temperature rises during the day.

Refueling - Gasoline vapors escape from the vehicles fuel tank while the tank is being
filled.

Grams

Starting a car cold increases trip emissions compared to starting the car warm.
For a 5-mile trip by a typical car in 1997, the vehicle emits about 6.7 grams of
NOX and 32.5 grams of CO if the engine is already warm. If, however, the
engine is cold, an additional 2.1 grams of NOX and 19.7 grams of CO are
generated. As a result, for a 5-mile trip, starting the car cold generates about
30% more NOX and 60% more CO than starting the car when it is warm.

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are emitted both from the tailpipe and
through fuel evaporation. About 2.7 grams of VOC are emitted from the
tailpipe if the engine is warm, and evaporative emissions (during travel and while
cooling down) result in 2.8 grams of VOC. Starting the car cold generates
another 2.5 grams of VOC.

Linking multiple tripscalled trip chaininghelps reduce emissions by elimi-
nating the cold start. However, on hot summer days, even when a car is parked
all day, VOC evaporates from the vehicles fuel tank. Approximately 3.8 grams
of VOC per day are emitted simply from having the car parked all day.

Vehicle Emissions

Emission Rates at Different Operating Speeds
Emission rates vary based on the speed a vehicle is traveling. The EPAs model
for highway vehicle emissionsMOBILE5ashows how speed affects emission
rates. VOC emission rates typically drop as speed increases, whereas NOX and
CO emission rates increase at high speeds. Emission rates at all speeds have been
falling over time as newer, more controlled vehicles enter the fleet.

These curves do not represent the full range of effects associated with travel at
different speeds. Emission rates are higher during stop-and-go, congested
traffic conditions than at free flow conditions operating at the same average
speed. Modeling improvements are underway to capture these effects.

Car and Truck Emissions
These comparisons show in-use emission rates for cars and heavy-duty diesel
trucks with 1998 control technology versus 1967 vehicles (before significant
control). Car emission rates have declined by 80  95% depending on the
pollutant, while diesel truck emission rates have declined by 10  60%.

For example, using a chainsaw for 1 hour emits the same amount of VOC as
driving 660 miles. To emit the same amount of CO as using a snowblower for 1
hour, one would have to drive 305 miles. Because non-road engines are a
significant source of pollution, EPA has promulgated new regulations aimed at
these types of engines.

A small percentage of vehicles emit a large percentage of the pollution from on-
road vehicles. These gross emitters include not only older model vehicles but
also some newer cars with poorly maintained or malfunctioning emissions
control equipment. As shown in the diagram, EPA estimates that less than 10
percent of the vehicle fleet emits over 40 percent of hydrocarbon pollution. The
dirtiest one percent of vehicles contribute over 25 percent of the hydrocarbon
pollution.
