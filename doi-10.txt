In a survey of AMS members, perceived scientific consensus was the strongest predictor 
of views on global warming, followed by political ideology, climate science expertise, and 

perceived organizational conflict.

M ounting an effective societal response to climate  

 change will require the involvement of the  
 government, business, and nongovernmental 
organization sectors, as well as a myriad of profes-
sional groups and members of the public at large.

Meteorologists and other experts in atmospheric and 
related sciences are one group of professionals whose 
involvement is particularly important. As experts 
on weather and weather prediction, they will play a 
variety of important roles in helping other stakeholder 
groups make informed decisions based on changing 
expectations about climate and weather. Their techni-
cal expertise is complemented by the fact that mem-
bers of the public see climate scientists and broadcast 
meteorologists as trustworthy sources of information 
on climate change (Leiserowitz et al. 2012).

Research conducted to date with meteorologists 
and other atmospheric scientists has shown that 
they are not unanimous in their views of climate 
change. In a survey of Earth scientists, Doran and 
Zimmerman (2009) found that, while a majority 
of meteorologists surveyed are convinced humans 
have contributed to global warming (GW; 64%), this 
was a substantially smaller majority than that found 
among all Earth scientists (82%). Another survey, 
by Farnsworth and Lichter (2009), found that 83% 
of meteorologists surveyed were convinced human-
induced climate change is occurring, again a smaller 
majority than among experts in related areas, such as 
ocean sciences (91%) and geophysics (88%).

JULY 2014AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY|There has been tension in recent years among 
American Meteorological Society (AMS) mem-
bers who hold different views on climate change 
(Schweizer et al. 2011). Some members have expressed 
that their views, which question the view that human-
caused global warming was occurring, are treated 
with hostility within the AMS (Schweizer et al. 2011). 
In response to this conflict, the AMS created the 
Committee to Improve Climate Change Communica-
tion (CICCC) (AMS Committee to Improve Climate 
Change Communication 2011). The CICCCs mission 
is to bring all constituencies of opinion to the discus-
sion table and to provide venues and modes of inter-
action that help facilitate respectful and constructive 
dialogue on climate change. The CICCCs mission 
does not explicitly include addressing specific areas 
of climate science or try to influence the outcomes 
of discussions.

To better understand members views about cli-
mate change and their perception of any remaining 
conf licts  about  climate  change  within  AMS 
membership, the CICCC commissioned George 
Mason University researchers to survey AMS mem-
bers; the top-line findings of that survey have been 
reported elsewhere (Maibach et al. 2012). In this 
paper, we report the results of two additional sets 
of analysis. First, to update previous research on 
the extent to which meteorologists are convinced 
of human-caused global warming, we conducted a 
modified replication of Doran and Zimmermans 
(2009) study. Next, we tested four specific hypotheses 
about factors believed to influence meteorologists 
views about climate change, specifically their level 
of certainty that climate change is occurring, their 
views on whether it is mostly human caused, and 
their views on how harmful or beneficial its results 
might be. The four hypothesized influencing factors 
are climate science expertise, political orientation, 
perceived scientific consensus, and perceived conflict 
about climate change within AMS; the specific hy-
potheses are presented and explained in detail below. 
Last, we analyzed open-ended responses from survey 
participants about the nature of the conflict about 
climate change within AMS; these findings will be 
reported in a subsequent paper.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES. 
Climate science expertise. Previous research using 
survey data (Doran and Zimmerman 2009) and 
citation analysis (Anderegg et al. 2010) has suggested 
that greater expertise in climate science, measured in 
terms of academic background and publishing record, 
is associated with higher conviction that human-

caused global warming is occurring. For example, 
in Doran and Zimmermans survey study, while only 
82% of the total sample indicated they are convinced 
that humans have contributed to global warming, 
89% of active publishers in the peer-reviewed scien-
tific literature and 97% of climate experts who publish 
primarily on climate change in the peer-reviewed 
scientific literature indicated they were convinced 
(Doran and Zimmerman 2009; Kendall Zimmerman 
2008). As a result, our first hypothesis is as follows:

H1: As compared with professionals with less 
expertise in climate change, professionals with more 
expertise will have higher levels of personal certainty 
that global warming is happening, will be more likely 
to view it is as mostly human caused, and will be more 
likely to view it as harmful rather than beneficial.

Political ideology. Decision making about how to mount 
an effective societal response to climate change in 
the United States has been complicated by increasing 
polarization over the issue, which has occurred 
largely along political lines. In the late 1990s, similar 
proportions of liberals and conservatives saw global 
warming as real; by 2008 (Dunlap and McCright 
2008)and continuing to the present (Leiserowitz 
et al. 2012)large differences had emerged such 
that liberals were more likely to see it as real, and 
conservatives had become increasingly skeptical. 
This growing polarization appears not to be caused by 
differences in scientific understandingindeed, most 
Americans know very little about the science of global 
warming (Leiserowitz et al. 2010)but rather by dif-
ferences in political ideology and deeper underlying 
values (Kahan et al. 2011). Many conservatives see 
the solutions proposed to mitigate global warming as 
being more harmful than global warming itself due 
to their effect on the economy (McCright and Dunlap 
2011). Liberals, on the other hand, are more likely to 
accept the dominant scientific view, as they see the 
proposed responses to global warming as strengthen-
ing activities they valuenamely, protection of the 
environment and regulation of industrial harm.

One might expect scientists norms of objectivity 
to prevent their political ideology from influencing 
their evaluation of scientific findings. Indeed, in one 
study scientists opinions on global warming policy 
responses varied by political ideology, but their views 
on the basic science did not (Rosenberg et al. 2010). 
However, other studies suggest scientists views on 
science can be influenced by ideology. A survey 
of members of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science showed that conservatives 

1030

JULY 2014|differed dramatically from liberals with regard to 
their views about the science of global warming 
(Nisbet 2011): 44% of conservatives saw global 
warming as mostly due to human activities, com-
pared to about 94% of liberals. We therefore hypoth-
esized the following:

H2: As compared with professionals with a more 
conservative political orientation, professionals with 
a more liberal political orientation will have higher 
levels of personal certainty that global warming is 
happening, will be more likely to be view it is as 
mostly human caused, and will be more likely to view 
it as harmful rather than beneficial.

Perceived scientific consensus. Public opinion research 
has shown that only a minority of the public (44%) 
agree that most scientists think global warming 
is happening (Leiserowitz et al. 2012, p. 18). Also, 
preliminary analyses of the data from the present 
survey found that only 59% of AMS members agree 
that 81%100% of climate scientists think that 
global warming is happening (Maibach et al. 2012). 
Members of the public who perceive agreement about 
global warming among scientific experts are more 
likely to view global warming as real, human caused, 
and harmful than people who do not perceive agree-
ment in the scientific community (Ding et al. 2011; 
Dunlap and McCright 2008; Krosnick et al. 2006). 
We therefore hypothesized the following:

H3: As compared with professionals who perceive less 
scientific consensus about global warming, profes-
sionals who perceive more scientific consensus will 
have higher levels of personal certainty that global 
warming is happening, will be more likely to be view 
it as mostly human caused, and will be more likely to 
view it as harmful rather than beneficial.

Perceived conflict. Schweizer et al. (2011) found that 
broadcast meteorologists who perceived conflict 
about global warming among their peers had 
disengaged from the issue, and they reported hav-
ing done so because of the pressure they felt from 
committed partisans in the conflict to choose 
sides. This finding parallels an argument that has 
been advanced in the political science literature that 
increasing levels of polarization in American politics 
has caused the moderate majority to disengage from 
political participation (Fiorina and Abrams 2008). 
One proposed reason for this political disengagement 
is that moderate voters feel no incentive to participate 
when they see the debate as primarily being driven by 

ideological positioning rather than a wish for problem 
solving (Fiorina and Abrams 2008). Schweizer et al. 
(2011) found similar sentiments expressed by broad-
cast meteorologists in relation to conflict about 
climate change within AMS. We believe that, when 
members of a professional group (including but not 
limited to meteorologists) perceive conflict within 
their peer group, they will withdraw from the conflict 
by moderating their views on the issue that is causing 
the conflict.

This moderation of views would entail AMS mem-
bers on both ends of the spectrum of views shifting 
closer toward the center. However, because we 
expected a larger number of members to have begun 
with views favoring human-caused global warming 
(prior to perceiving conflict at the AMS), we also ex-
pected any moderating influence to result in members 
revising their views of global warming downward 
more often than upward. For this reason, when 
averaged across the whole population of members, 
we would expect greater perception of conflict to 
be associated with a reduced level of conviction that 
human-caused global warming was occurring. We 
therefore hypothesized the following:

H4: As compared with professionals who perceive less 
conflict about global warming within the member-
ship base of their professional society, professionals 
who perceive more conflict will report lower levels of 
personal certainty that global warming is happening, 
will be less likely to be view it is as mostly human 
caused, and will be less likely to view it as harmful 
rather than beneficial.

METHOD. On 29 December 2011, we e-mailed 
all 7,197 AMS members for whom AMS had an 
e-mail address, excluding associate members and 
student members. The e-mailsigned by the CICCC 
chairsrequested participation in our survey 
and provided a link to the web-based survey form 
(including the consent form). On 6 January 2012, 
and again on 11 January 2012, participants who had 
not yet responded received reminders by e-mail. On 
27 March 2012, 375 participants who had given one 
specific answer (to a question on global warming 
causation) were e-mailed a request to answer one 
additional question (designed to clarify their view on 
causation). This question is described further below.
Of the 7,197 people invited to participate, 135 peo-
ple were ineligible due to invalid addresses. Therefore, 
the valid denominator of our sample was 7,062. Of 
these, 1,854 people completed at least some portion 
of the survey beyond the consent form, yielding a 

1031

JULY 2014AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY|minimum response rate of 26.3% (which assumes 
that all nonrespondents were eligible to participate); 
this is slightly lower than the average rate for web 
surveys (Shih and Fan 2008). Of the 375 people who 
were sent the follow-up question, 271 responded. One 
of these respondents refused to answer the question, 
for a response rate to the follow-up question of 270 
out of 375, or 72%.

Independent variables. exPertiSe. To assess climate 
science expertise, we examined three measures: 
whether respondents indicated climate science as 
their area of expertise, their highest degree obtained, 
and their peer-reviewed publishing record on climate 
change over the last five years. Using principal axis 
factor analysis, we found these measures formed a 
single factor; loadings for all variables were within 
the acceptable range (Gorsuch 1983). We therefore 
decided to sum all three variables into an index 
of climate science expertise. For area of expertise, 
participants who indicated climate science as their 
area of expertise were scored 1; all others were scored 
0. For highest degree obtained, participants who 
answered PhD (or other doctoral degree) and MS 
or MA were scored 2 and 1, respectively; all others 
were scored 0. For publishing record, respondents 
who said they published more than 50% of their 
peer-reviewed papers in the last five years on cli-
mate change were scored 2. We asked whether they 
had published more or less than 50% of their papers 
in climate change to achieve comparability with 
the results of Doran and Zimmerman (2009), who 
also used this as one of their measures of expertise. 
Those who said they published fewer than 50% of 
their papers on climate change, or who answered 
N/A to the question on their proportion of climate 
change papers, were scored 1. Those who had not 
published in the last five years were scored 0. The 
scores on all three variables were summed, resulting 
in a composite variable with possible scores ranging 
from 0 to 5.

Political  ideology. This measure was based on re-
sponses to the question, In general, do you think 
of yourself as: to which participants could respond 
Very conservative, Somewhat conservative, 
Moderate, Somewhat liberal, or Very liberal. 
The responses were coded 04, respectively.

Perceived coNSeNSuS. Respondents were asked, To the 
best of your knowledge, what proportion of climate 
scientists think that human-caused global warming 
is happening? Response categories were 0%20%, 

21%40%, 41%60%, 61%80%, 81%100% (coded 
15, respectively), and I dont know enough to say. 
Respondents who indicated I dont know (n = 156) 
were excluded from the analyses, so that perceived 
consensus could be analyzed as a single continuous 
variable. To assess if the exclusion of Dont know 
respondents influenced our findings, we conducted 
additional analyses with all respondents using 
dummy coding, a statistical technique that allows 
noncontinuous variables to be entered into linear 
regressions. This produced no significant change to 
the results.

Perceived  coNflict. Respondents were asked if they 
agreed or disagreed with the statement, There 
is conflict among AMS members on the issue of 
global warming. Response options were Strongly 
disagree, Somewhat disagree, Neither agree nor 
disagree, Somewhat agree, and Strongly agree. 
The responses were coded 04, respectively.

Dependent variables. certaiNty. To establish the cer-
tainty of respondents views on global warming, we 
asked two questions. The first asked whether global 
warming is happening, and the second assessed the 
respondents level of certainty that it is happening. 
The first question was worded as follows: In this 
survey, the term global warming refers to the 
premise that the worlds average temperature has 
been increasing over the past 150 years, may be 
increasing more in the future, and that the worlds 
climate may change as a result. Regardless of the 
cause, do you think that global warming is happen-
ing? Respondents who answered either Yes or 
No were presented with the following certainty 
assessment item: How sure are you that global 
warming [is/is not] happening? We then calculated 
a composite measure to capture the responses to the 
two questions in a single variable. This resulted in a 
nine-point certainty measure ranging from -4 (Global 
warming not happeningextremely sure) to +4 
(Global warming happeningextremely sure), with 
zero (Dont know if global warming is happening) as 
the neutral midpoint.

cauSe. If respondents indicated they agreed global 
warming was occurring, we subsequently asked them 
the question, Do you think that the global warming 
that has occurred over the past 150 years has been 
caused. . . to which they could answer Mostly by 
human activity, Mostly by natural events, More-
or-less equally by human activity and natural events, 
I do not believe we (scientists) know enough yet to 

1032

JULY 2014|determine the degree of human or natural causation, 
even in the general terms stated in the categories 
above, and I dont know.

To make a more precise comparison of our results 
to those of Doran and Zimmerman (2009), a follow-
up question was posed via e-mail (approximately 10 
weeks later) to those who answered, I do not believe 
we know enough to determine the degree of human 
causation. Specifically, we sought to determine 
if these participants were convinced that human 
activity has contributed to global warming. Thus, we 
asked, Do you think human activity has contributed 
to the global warming that has occurred over the past 
150 years? The answer options were Yes, No, and 
Dont know. (The full text of the follow-up e-mail is 
available in the appendix of this article.) Percentages 
of respondents who gave each possible response to 
the causation question are displayed below in Table 1. 
Because of the categorical nature of these responses, 
they could not be used as a dependent variable for 
linear regression analysis. Therefore, they were trans-
formed into a dichotomous variable for use in binary 
logistic regression. This variable was coded 1 for all 
respondents who agreed global warming is caused 
mostly by human activity and 0 for respondents 
who gave any other response.

level of harM/beNefit. Respondents who agreed global 
warming was occurring were asked the following 
question: Over the next 100 years, how harmful or 
beneficial do you think global warming will be to 
people and society, if nothing is done to address it? 
Response options were as follows: very harmful, 
somewhat harmful, the harms and benefits will 
be more or less equal, somewhat beneficial, very 
beneficial, and dont know. Only about 10% of re-
spondents answered dont know. We omitted these 
participants so that linear regression could be used 
on a continuous dependent variable ranging from 
very beneficial (coded 0) to very harmful (coded 
4), with a midpoint of the harms and benefits will 
be more or less equal (coded 2).

ANALYSIS. Using SPSS versions 17.0 and 19.0, 
we examined the distributions of all variables. 
To compare our results to those of Doran and 
Zimmerman (2009), we cross tabulated the results for 
the initial and follow-up questions on global warming 
causation by area of expertise, publishing record in 
the last five years, and proportion of papers in the last 
five years that were on global warming.

To test our hypotheses, we conducted linear and 
logistic regressions. Global warming certainty and 

harm/benefit served as dependent variables in the 
linear regressions, and the view that global warm-
ing is/is not mostly human caused (coded 1 for all 
respondents who agreed global warming is mostly 
human caused and 0 for respondents who made any 
other response) served as the dependent variable 
in the logistic regression. In all of these analyses 
demographic variables, expertise, political ideology, 
perceived scientific consensus on global warming, 
and perceived conflict served as the independent 
variables.

It should be noted that the analyses for causation 
and harm/benefit only include data from the 89% of 
the sample who said that global warming is happening 
(rather than not happening or dont know). Since 
the other 11% did not answer the questions on global 
warming causation and harm/benefit, they could not 
be included in analyses of answers to these questions.

RESULTS. Replication of Doran and Zimmerman 
(2009). Table 1 shows the proportion of survey 
respondentsdivided by their area of expertise 
(climate change vs meteorology and atmospheric 
science) and their publishing record (publishing 
mostly on climate change vs publishing mostly on 
other topics vs nonpublishing)who report each of 
several different views on whether global warming 
is happening and what is causing it. The proportion 
of each group that is convinced that humans have 
contributed to global warming is determined by 
adding the proportions presented in the tables first 
row (respondents who indicated global warming is 
happening and it is mostly human caused), second 
row (respondents who indicated global warming 
is happening and it is equally human caused and 
natural), and the first row of the Insufficient Evidence 
subsection at the bottom of the table (respondents 
who indicated global warming is happening and 
although there is insufficient evidence to attribute 
cause with precision, human activity is implicated 
to some degree).

Climate science experts who publish mostly on 
climate change and climate scientists who publish 
mostly on other topics were the two groups most 
likely to be convinced that humans have contributed 
to global warming, with 93% of each group indicating 
their concurrence. The two groups least likely 
to be convinced of this were the nonpublishing 
climate scientists and nonpublishing meteorologists/
atmospheric scientists, at 65% and 59%, respectively. 
In the middle were the two groups of publishing 
meteorologists/atmospheric scientists at 79% and 
78%, respectively.

JULY 2014|Hypothesis tests. Confirming all four hypotheses, the 
regression analyses showed that greater expertise, 
more liberal ideology, greater perceived consensus, 
and lower perceived conflict each predicted higher 
levels of certainty global warming was occurring, 
higher likelihood of viewing it as mostly human 
caused, and greater ratings of future harm. Together, 
the independent variables explained 37% of the varia-
tion in certainty that global warming is occurring 
and 29% of the variation in views on global warming 
harm, which is considered a moderate amount of 
explained variance in social science research (Cohen 
1992). Because of the nature of logistic regression, an 
equivalent statistic is unavailable for the proportion 
of explained variation in views on global warming 
causation.

In terms of strength of the relationship between 
the independent and dependent variables, perceived 
consensus was the strongest predictor of all three 
types of global warming viewscertainty, causation, 
and harm/benefit. Political ideology was the second 
strongest predictor of view certainty and causation, 
and was equivalent to perceived consensus as predic-
tor of harm/benefit. Expertise and perceived conflict 
were both less strong predictors of global warming 
views. Expertise was the second weakest predictor of 
global warming certainty and the weakest predictor 
of causation and harm/benefit. Perceived conflict 
was the weakest predictor of global warming view 
certainty, and the second weakest predictor of causa-
tion and harm/benefit. For details of the regression 
analyses, see the online supplement (http://dx.doi 
.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00091.2).

DISCUSSION. Our findings regarding the degree 
of consensus about human-caused climate change 
among the most expert meteorologists are similar 
to those of Doran and Zimmerman (2009): 93% of 
actively publishing climate scientists indicated they 
are convinced that humans have contributed to global 
warming. Our findings also revealed that majorities 
of experts view human activity as the primary cause 
of recent climate change: 78% of climate experts 
actively publishing on climate change, 73% of all 
people actively publishing on climate change, and 
62% of active publishers who mostly do not publish 
on climate change. These results, together with those 
of other similar studies, suggest high levels of expert 
consensus about human-caused climate change 
(Farnsworth and Lichter 2012; Bray 2010).

Furthermore, our study was the first study of sci-
entific professionals we know of to include expertise, 
political ideology, and perceived scientific consensus 

in a regression analysis and thus compare the poten-
tial unique effects of each in shaping global warming 
views. We found that perceived scientific consensus, 
political ideology, expertise, and perceived conflict 
are each, to greater or lesser degrees, associated with 
AMS members views of global warming. Before 
considering implications of those findings, however, 
readers should consider two methodological issues 
that could have affected the accuracy of our results.
First, even though the response rate to our survey 
was well within the normative range, nearly three-
quarters of the AMS members invited to participate 
did not do so. This raises the possibility that our 
respondents may not accurately represent the views 
of the broader AMS membership. It is plausible, for 
example, that AMS members skeptical of global 
warming may have been less likely than the average 
member to respond, potentially by virtue of feeling 
marginalized within their professional society as a 
result of the views on the issue. Conversely, it is also 
plausible that skeptical members may have been more 
likely than the average member to respond, due to 
a desire to use the opportunity to have their views 
recognized by AMS leadership and other members. 
We have no way of directly assessing the comparabil-
ity of our sample to the broader AMS population in 
terms of global warming views. We have, however, 
compared the demographics of our respondents to 
the demographics from an AMS membership survey 
conducted in 2005 (Murillo et al. 2008; n = 5,394; 
survey completion rate = 48%). Our sample had fewer 
students (1% vs 17% in 2005, although we intention-
ally did not include student members in our sample), 
more retired members (11% vs 4% in 2005), more 
older members (59% were 50 or over vs 33% over 
50 in 2005), more members with doctorates (52% vs 
38%), more members employed in research (41% vs 
31%), and fewer female members (15% vs 20%). It is 
thus reasonable to suggest the present sample is quite 
similar to the overall membership of the AMS, at least 
demographically.

Second, our estimates of the proportion of AMS 
members who are convinced that global warming is 
occurring should be interpreted in light of an issue 
that arose regarding the time frame of global warming 
that we asked about. We asked respondents specifi-
cally about global warming that occurred over the last 
150 years. However, the findings of the 2007 Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report 
state that human activity has been the dominant 
cause of warming since the mid-twentieth century 
(Pachauri and Reisinger 2007, p. 39). Six respondents 
sent e-mails to notify us that their answers would have 

1035

JULY 2014AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY|been different if we had asked about the most recent 
50-yr time frame rather than the 150-yr time frame; 
the time frame used in the question may have also 
influenced other respondents. Our results therefore 
may represent a more conservative estimate of the 
consensus on global warming than would have been 
obtained had we asked about a 50-yr time frame. The 
relationships of the independent variables and global 
warming views may also have been affected by the 
time frame described, as we discuss further below.

Confirmation of our four hypotheses shows that 
meteorologists views about global warming observed 
in the last 150 years are associated with, and may be 
causally influenced by, a range of personal and social 
factors. In other words, the notion that expertise is 
the single dominant factor shaping meteorologists 
views of global warming appears to be simplistic to 
the point of being incorrect.

We found that perceived scientific consensus 
was the factor most strongly associated with AMS 
members views about global warming. This suggests 
that scientists thinking on scientific topics may be sub-
ject to the same kinds of social normative influences 
that affect the general public. Rather than rationally 
weighing the evidence and deciding for themselves, 
as would be expected under more traditional ideas of 
scientific judgment, scientists may also use the views 
of a relevant peer group as a social cue for forming 
their own views. Our results are consistent with those 
of Lewandowsky et al. (2013), who found that provid-
ing information on the scientific consensus increased 
the likelihood of members of the public agreeing that 
global warming was occurring. Our data are cross 
sectional, rather than experimental as in Lewandowsky 
et al. (2013), so we cannot be certain of the direction 
of the causal relationship between perceived consen-
sus and views on global warming for AMS members. 
Nevertheless, the findings of Lewandowsky et al. (2013) 
combined with our results suggest that perceived sci-
entific consensus may have a substantial influence on 
AMS members global warming views.

Political ideology was the factor next most strongly 
associated with meteorologists views about global 
warming. This also goes against the idea of scientists 
opinions being entirely based on objective analysis 
of the evidence and concurs with previous studies 
that have shown scientists opinions on topics to 
vary along with their political orientation (Nisbet 
2011; Rosenberg et al. 2010). The result suggests that 
members of professional scientific organizations have 
not been immune to influence by the political polar-
ization on climate change that has affected politicians 
and the general public.

1036

We found expertise to be positively associated 
with meteorologists views about global warming, 
concurring with previous studies on the relationship 
between climate science expertise and global warming 
views (Doran and Zimmerman 2009; Anderegg et al. 
2010). This result is contrary to that found by Kahan 
et al. (2012b), in which members of the public with 
greater scientific literacy viewed climate change as 
a slightly less serious risk. The difference between 
the two studies is likely explained by the different 
measures of expertise. As opposed to comprehension 
of rudimentary scientific facts, knowledge acquired 
via graduate-level training and publishing in climate 
science does appear to increase the likelihood of 
viewing global warming as real, human caused, and 
harmful, if other factors are held constant.

While we found that higher expertise was associated 
with a greater likelihood of viewing global warming 
as real and harmful, this relationship was less strong 
than for political ideology and perceived consensus. At 
least for the measure of expertise that we used, climate 
science expertise may be a less important influence on 
global warming views than political ideology or social 
consensus norms. More than any other result of the 
study, this would be strong evidence against the idea 
that expert scientists views on politically controversial 
topics can be completely objective.

Finally, we found that perceiving conflict at AMS 
was associated with lower certainty of global warming 
views, lower likelihood of viewing global warming 
as human caused, and lower ratings of predicted 
harm caused by global warming. This suggests that 
perceiving conflict within the context of their pro-
fessional society may have caused AMS members to 
withdraw from the issue of global warming by mod-
erating their beliefs. In addition to individual-level 
factors such as expertise and ideology affecting views 
on global warming, the polarized discursive environ-
ment in which discussion of the issue takes place may 
be reducing the chances of widespread engagement 
with it (Schweizer et al. 2011).

As our data are cross sectional, we cannot rule 
out an alternative possibility for the causal direction 
of this relationship. Rather than perceived conflict 
influencing views of global warming, people with 
skeptical views on global warming might become 
relatively more likely to perceive conflict at the AMS. 
Nevertheless, the significant relationships obtained in 
this study are enough to warrant further investigation 
of the possibility of increasing engagement through 
resolving conflicts at AMS.

As we mentioned above, asking about a 150-yr time 
frame rather than a 50-yr time frame may also have 

JULY 2014|changed the strength of the relationships between 
global warming views and other variables. For example, 
expertise may have been a stronger predictor of views 
on human causation if we had asked about a shorter 
time frame. Because the evidence for human causation 
is much stronger for the last 50 years (Pachauri and 
Reisinger 2007), we would expect experts, who are pre-
sumably familiar with this evidence, to be substantially 
more likely to view global warming in this period as 
human caused than nonexperts who were not familiar 
with the evidence. Conversely, the evidence is weaker 
for human causation over the past 150 years, and 
experts familiarity with this weak evidence would be 
less likely to lead to viewing climate change as human 
caused. The importance of the other independent 
variablesperceived consensus, political ideology, and 
perceived conflictwe would predict to remain largely 
unchanged. Because these variables are not postulated 
to affect global warming views through direct knowl-
edge of scientific evidence, changing a scientific detail 
(the 150-yr time frame) should not affect the influence 
these variables have on global warming views.

Although we believe our research raises more 
important questions than it answers, we do see some 
important practical implications of our findings. First, 
the strong relationship between perceived scientific 
consensus and other views on climate change sug-
gests that communication centered on the high level 
of scientific consensus may be effective in encouraging 
engagement by scientific professionals. This explora-
tion of views of the consensus could be accomplished 
via town hallstyle events at professional society 
meetings, where participants responses to exploratory 
questions are aggregated and presented back to the 
group for reflection, discussion, and dialogue. It could 
also be accomplished via world cafe-style discussion 
events (Brown and Isaacs 2005), such as that conducted 
recently by the Washington, D.C., chapter of the AMS.
Second, the relationship between political ideology 
and global warming views suggests that those wishing 
to encourage engagement should find a way to 
address the political differences that are likely to exist 
between those with different views on climate change. 
One way to do this could be to recognize and affirm 
the value of all members political views prior to 
discussions of climate science. Discourse that affirms 
the value of diverse worldviews has shown potential to 
promote less polarized discussion of scientific issues 
where ideology has influenced differences of opinion, 
such as climate change (Kahan et al. 2012a).

Third, engagement efforts should include refutation 
of the idea that members who do not share the con-
sensus view in climate science are lacking in expertise. 

A substantial number of expert AMS members22% 
of the most expert group in our sampledo not sub-
scribe to the position that global warming is mostly 
human caused. Climate experts are not completely 
homogenous in their views on global warming, just 
as climate skeptics have been shown to have a variety 
of nuanced opinions (Hobson and Niemeyer 2013). 
Any suggestion that all those with nonmajority views 
simply need to be educated is inaccurate and is 
likely to be insulting to a substantial number of AMS 
members. Discussion based on an understanding that 
views are more nuanced would be more productive.

Fourth, efforts to increase engagement with 
climate change will have minimal effects if they 
focus on increasing climate science knowledge 
alone. Although higher expertise is associated with 
increased tendency to view climate change as real 
and harmful, the increase resulting even from major 
gains insuch as that associated with obtaining a 
doctorateseems to be quite modest. Increases in 
knowledge obtained through short-term campaigns 
are likely to be even smaller. For this reason, engage-
ment campaigns should attempt to deal with other 
important factors such as consensus and political 
ideology as well as purely scientific information.

Finally, AMS and other organizations seeking 
to enhance the climate change readiness of the 
meteorology  community  should  find  ways  to 
acknowledge and deal with the conflict. This may 
improve relations between membersa worthy goal 
in itselfand higher levels of willingness to engage 
with climate change may also result. Recently, the 
AMS CICCC and the other authors of this article 
have been involved in exploratory conflict analysis 
and mediation workshops with AMS members and 
other groups of meteorologists; the results to date 
of those efforts have been promising (Schweizer 
et al. 2011, 2014). Given the importance of the issue, 
continuing these efforts and/or exploring alternative 
conflict analysis resolution methods would appear to 
be a worthy priority.

In conclusion, given the potential for human 
society and the Earths ecosystems to be harmed by 
climate change, it is imperative that members of the 
scientific communityand the professional societies 
that represent themtake all reasonable measures 
to ensure that what is known about the risks, and 
about options for managing those risks, are shared 
with decision makers, who should be considering 
that information. While the difficulties of doing this 
are widely acknowledged (Pidgeon and Fischhoff 
2011), the problem is often attributed to the difficult 
dynamics associated with external communication: 

1037

JULY 2014AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY|that is, sharing complex scientific information with 
the broader community. Our research suggests that 
there are also important dynamics associated with 
internal communication, that is, sharing informa-
tion and coming to consensus within the scientific 
community.

APPENDIX: TEXT OF FOLLOW-UP E-MAIL.
Dear fellow AMS member,

You graciously participated in a survey that I sent you in late December 2011 on behalf of the AMS Committee 
to Improve Climate Change Communication. Thank you.

It has become clear that one question on the survey included an answer option that is difficult to interpret 
without additional information.

That questionand its answer optionswas:

Do you think that the global warming that has occurred over the past 150 years has been caused . . .

a) Mostly by human activity

b) More-or-less equally by human activity and natural events

c) Mostly by natural events

d) I do not believe we (scientists) know enough yet to determine the degree of human or natural causation, 
even in the general terms stated in the categories above

e) I dont know

You answered (d), the response option that we dont know how to interpret. We are hoping to clarify what 
you meant by asking you one additional question.

Do you think human activity has contributed to the global warming that has occurred over the past 150 years?

Yes
No
Dont know

Please reply to this e-mail by typing one of the following: Yes, No, or Dont Know.

If you wish to add an explanation of your answer feel free to do so, but please begin your reply with only 
Yes, No, or Dont Know.

Thank you very much for taking the time to do this.

Taken by Storm, 1938: 
A Social and Meteorological History  
of the Great New England Hurricane  

LourdeS B. AviLeS
When the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 hit the  Northeast 
unannounced, it changed everything from the landscape, to Red 
Cross and Weather Bureau protocols, to the measure of Great 
Depression relief New Englanders would receive, and the resulting 
pace of regional economic recovery. The science behind this storm 
is presented here for the first time, with new data that sheds light  
on the motivations of the Weather Bureau forecasters. This 
compelling history successfully weaves science, historical  
accounts, and social analyses to create a comprehensive  
picture of the most powerful and devastating  
hurricane to hit New England to date.
