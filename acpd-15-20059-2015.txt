Abstract

There is evidence of ice melt, sea level rise to +59 m, and extreme storms in the prior
interglacial period that was less than 1 C warmer than today. Human-made climate
forcing is stronger and more rapid than paleo forcings, but much can be learned by
combining insights from paleoclimate, climate modeling, and on-going observations.
We argue that ice sheets in contact with the ocean are vulnerable to non-linear disin-
tegration in response to ocean warming, and we posit that ice sheet mass loss can be
approximated by a doubling time up to sea level rise of at least several meters. Dou-
bling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield sea level rise of several meters in 50, 100 or
200 years. Paleoclimate data reveal that subsurface ocean warming causes ice shelf
melt and ice sheet discharge. Our climate model exposes amplifying feedbacks in the
Southern Ocean that slow Antarctic bottom water formation and increase ocean tem-
perature near ice shelf grounding lines, while cooling the surface ocean and increasing
sea ice cover and water column stability. Ocean surface cooling, in the North Atlantic
as well as the Southern Ocean, increases tropospheric horizontal temperature gradi-
ents, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, which drive more powerful storms. We focus
attention on the Southern Oceans role in affecting atmospheric CO2 amount, which in
turn is a tight control knob on global climate. The millennial (5002000 year) time scale
of deep ocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO2 change, thus the time
scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet and sea level changes. This millennial carbon
cycle time scale should not be misinterpreted as the ice sheet time scale for response
to a rapid human-made climate forcing. Recent ice sheet melt rates have a doubling
time near the lower end of the 1040 year range. We conclude that 2 C global warming
above the preindustrial level, which would spur more ice shelf melt, is highly danger-
ous. Earths energy imbalance, which must be eliminated to stabilize climate, provides
a crucial metric.

Humanity is rapidly extracting and burning fossil fuels without full understanding of the
consequences. Current assessments place emphasis on practical effects such as in-
creasing extremes of heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall, floods, and encroaching
seas (IPCC, 2014; USNCA, 2014). These assessments and our recent study (Hansen
et al., 2013a) conclude that there is an urgency to slow carbon dioxide (CO2) emis-
sions, because the longevity of the carbon in the climate system (Archer, 2005) and
persistence of the induced warming (Solomon et al., 2010) may lock in unavoidable
highly undesirable consequences.

Despite these warnings, global CO2 emissions continue to increase as fossil fuels
remain the primary energy source. The argument is made that it is economically and
morally responsible to continue fossil fuel use for the sake of raising living standards,
with expectation that humanity can adapt to climate change and find ways to minimize
effects via advanced technologies.

We suggest that this viewpoint fails to appreciate the nature of the threat posed by
ice sheet instability and sea level rise. If the ocean continues to accumulate heat and in-
crease melting of marine-terminating ice shelves of Antarctica and Greenland, a point
will be reached at which it is impossible to avoid large scale ice sheet disintegration
with sea level rise of at least several meters. The economic and social cost of losing
functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable. We suggest that a strate-
gic approach relying on adaptation to such consequences is unacceptable to most of
humanity, so it is important to understand this threat as soon as possible.

We examine events late in the last interglacial period warmer than today, called Ma-
rine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e in studies of ocean sediment cores, Eemian in European
climate studies, and sometimes Sangamonian in American literature (see Sect. 5 for
timescale diagram of Marine Isotope Stages). Accurately known changes of Earths as-
tronomical configuration altered the seasonal and geographical distribution of incoming
radiation during the Eemian. Resulting global warming was due to feedbacks that am-

plified the orbital forcing. While the Eemian is not an analog of future warming, it is
useful for investigating climate feedbacks, the response of polar ice sheets to polar
warming, and the interplay between ocean circulation and ice sheet melt.

Our study relies on a large body of research by the scientific community. After intro-
ducing evidence concerning late Eemian climate change, we analyze relevant climate
processes in three stages. First we carry our IPCC-like climate simulations, but with
growing freshwater sources in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Second we
use paleoclimate data to extract information on key processes identified by the mod-
eling. Third we use modern data to show that these processes are already spurring
climate change today.

2 Evidence concerning Eemian climate

We first discuss geologic evidence of late-Eemian sea level rise and storms. We then
discuss ocean core data that help define a rapid cooling event in the North Atlantic that
marks the initial descent from interglacial conditions toward global ice age conditions.
This rapid end-Eemian cooling occurs at  118 ky b2k in ocean cores with uncertainty

15  2 ky, and is identified by Chapman and Shackleton (1999) as cold event C26.

C26 is the cold phase of DansgaardOeschger climate oscillation DO 26 in the
NGRIP (North Greenland Ice Core Project) ice core (NGRIP, 2004). C26 begins with
a sharp cooling at 119.14 ky b2k on the GICC05modelext time scale (Rasmussen et
al., 2014). The GICC05 time scale is based on annual layer counting in Greenland ice
cores for the last 60 ky and on an ice flow-model extension for earlier times. An alter-
native time scale is provided by Antarctic ice core chronology AICC2012 (Bazin et al.,
2013; Veres et al., 2013) on which Greenland ice core records have been synchronized
via global markers such as oscillations of atmospheric CH4 amount. C26 on Greenland
is at 116.72 ky b2k on the AICC2012 time scale. Figure S1 in the Supplement shows
the difference between GICC05 and AICC2012 times scales versus time.

This age uncertainty for C26 is consistent with the ice core 2 error estimate of
3.2 ky at Eemian time (Bazin et al., 2013). Despite this absolute age uncertainty, we
can use Greenland data synchronized to the AICC2012 time scale to determine the
relative timing of Greenland and Antarctic climate changes (Sect. 5) to an accuracy of
a few decades (Bazin et al., 2013).

2.1 Eemian sea level
Eemian sea level is of special interest because Eemian climate was at most  2 C
warmer than pre-industrial climate, thus at most  1 C warmer than today. Indeed,
based on multiple data and model sources Masson-Delmotte et al. (2013) suggest
that peak Eemian temperature was only a few tenths of a degree warmer than to-
day. The Eemian period thus provides an indication of sea level change that can be
expected if global temperature reaches and maintains a level moderately higher than
today. Eemian sea level reached heights several meters above todays level (Chen et
al., 1991; Neumann and Hearty, 1996; Hearty et al., 2007; Kopp et al., 2009; Dutton
and Lambeck, 2012; OLeary et al., 2013). Although climate forcings were weak and
changed slowly during the Eemian, there were probably instances in the Eemian with
sea level change of the order of 1 m century1 (Rohling et al., 2008; W. Thompson et
al., 2011; Blanchon et al., 2009).

Hearty et al. (2007) used shoreline stratigraphy, field information, and geochronolog-
ical data from 15 sites around the world to construct a composite curve of Eemian sea
level change. Their reconstruction has sea level rising in the early Eemian to +23 m
(+ indicates above todays sea level). Mid-Eemian sea level may have fallen a few
meters to a level near todays sea level. Sea level rose rapidly in the late Eemian when
it cut multiple bioerosional notches in older limestone in the Bahamas and elsewhere
at +69 m. These brief upward shifts of sea level were interpreted as evidence of rapid
ice melt events.

This sea level behavior may be surprising at first glance, and it is easy to question
specific details because of the difficulties in sea level reconstructions, including the

effect of regional glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) of Earths crust as ice sheets grow
and decay. Indeed, rapid late-Eemian sea level rise is unexpected, because seasonal
insolation anomalies favored growth of Northern Hemisphere ice at that time. However,
the basic conclusion that arises from global studies is a sea level elevation difference
of 35 m between late and early Eemian. We will show in the remainder of this paper
that there is now substantial supporting evidence for these sea level change features
and a rational interpretation.

Assessed chronology of sea level change depends on ages estimated for fossil
corals. The analytic uncertainty of uranium radioactive decay (U-series) ages is about
1 ky (Edwards et al., 2003; Scholz and Mangini, 2007), but often undetectable dia-
genetic effects can increase the error (Bard et al., 1992; Thompson and Goldstein,
2005). The growth position of corals is a good, though not comprehensive, indicator of
sea level, because sea level had to be higher than the reef at the time of coral growth.
However, some corals grow at a range of depths, which adds uncertainty. Furthermore,
if sea level rises too fast, corals tend to give up or founder, only recording minimum
sea level (Neumann and MacIntyre, 1985), and if sea level falls corals are exposed, die,
and thus stop recording sea level. Mobile carbonate sediments that mantle limestone
platforms such as Bermuda and the Bahamas record rapid sea level change effectively,
because the sediments respond and cement quickly, thus preserving sea level change
evidence.

Hearty and Kindler (1993), White et al. (1998) and Wilson et al. (1998) describe
evidence in fossil Bahamian reefs of a mid-Eemian regressive-transgressive cycle (sea
level fall and rise). They estimated a sea level fall from +4 m to approximately todays
level, and then a rise to at least +6 m. U-series dating defined the period of fall and rise
as a maximum of 1500 years covering  125 to 124 ky b2k, and the high stand lasting
until  119 ky b2k. Such rapid sea level change requires ice sheet growth and melt,
regional lithospheric adjustment, or both.

Blanchon et al. (2009) used a sequence of coral reef crests from northeast Yucatan
peninsula, Mexico, to investigate sea level change with a higher temporal precision

than possible with U-series dating alone. They used coral reef back-stepping, i.e., the
fact that the location of coral reef building moves shoreward as sea level rises, to infer
sea level change. They found that in the latter half of the Eemian there was a point
at which sea level jumped by 23 m within an ecological period, i.e., within several
decades. From U-series dating they estimated that this period of rapid sea level rise
occurred at about 121 ky b2k. W. Thompson et al. (2011) reexamined Eemian coral
reef data from the Bahamas with a method that corrected uranium-thorium ages for
diagenic disturbances. They confirmed a mid-Eemian sea level minimum, putting sea
level at +4 m at 123 ky b2k, at +6 m at 119 ky b2k, and at 0 m at some time in between,
again noting that coral reefs only record minimum sea level.

Despite general consistency among these studies, considerable uncertainty re-
mains about details of Eemian sea level change. Sources of uncertainty include post-
depositional effects of GIA and local tectonics. Global models of GIA of Earths crust
to loading and unloading of ice sheets are used increasingly to improve assessments
of past sea level change. Although GIA models contain uncertain parameters, they
provide a useful indication of possible displacement of geological sea level indicators.
OLeary et al. (2013) provide a new perspective on Eemian sea level change using
over 100 well-dated U-series coral reefs at 28 sites along the 1400 km west coast of
Australia and incorporating GIA corrections on regional sea level. In agreement with
Hearty et al. (2007), their analyses suggest that sea level was relatively stable at 3
4 m in most of the Eemian, followed by a rapid (< 1000 yr) late-Eemian sea level rise to
about +9 m. U-series dating of the corals has the sea level rise begin at 119 ky b2k and
peak sea level at 118.11.4 ky b2k. This dating of peak sea level is consistent with the
estimate of Hearty and Neumann (2001) of  118 ky b2k as the time of rapid climate
changes and extreme storminess.

End-Eemian sea level rise would seem to be a paradox, because orbital forcing then
favored growth of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. We will find evidence, however, that
the sea level rise and increased storminess are consistent, and likely related to events
in the Southern Ocean.

2.2 Evidence of end-Eemian storms in Bahamas and Bermuda

Late-Eemian sea level rise was followed by rapid sea level fall at the end of MIS 5e
(Neumann and Hearty, 1996; Stirling et al., 1998; McCulloch and Esat, 2000; Lambeck
and Chappell, 2001; Lea et al., 2002). Geologic data suggest that this sea level os-
cillation was accompanied by increased temperature gradients and storminess in the
North Atlantic region. Here we summarize evidence for end-Eemian storminess, based
mainly on geological studies of Neumann and Hearty (1996), Hearty (1997), Hearty et
al. (1998), Hearty and Neumann (2001) and Hearty et al. (2007) in Bermuda and the
Bahamas. In following sections we examine data from ocean sediment cores relevant
to climate events in this period and then make global climate simulations, which help
us suggest causal connections among end-Eemian events.

The Bahama Banks are low-lying carbonate platforms that are exposed during
glacials and largely flooded during interglacial high stands. From a tectonic perspec-
tive, the platforms are relatively stable, but may have experienced minor GIA effects.
When flooded during MIS 5e sea level rise, enormous volumes of aragonitic oolitic
grains were generated across the shallow high energy banks, shoals, ridges, and
dunes, where storm deposits indurated rapidly upon subaerial exposure, preserving
rock evidence of brief, high-energy events. The preserved stratigraphic, sedimentary
and geomorphic features attest to the energy of the late-Eemian Atlantic Ocean and
point to a turbulent end-Eemian transition.

In the Bahama Islands, extensive oolitic sand ridges with a distinctive landward-
pointing V-shape are common, each standing in relief across several kilometers of low
area (Hearty et al., 1998). Termed chevron ridges from their characteristic V-shape,
these beach ridges are found on broad, low lying platforms or ramps throughout the
Atlantic-facing, deep-water margins of the Bahamas. Hearty et al. (1998) examined 35
areas with chevron ridges across the Bahamas, which all point in a southwest direction
(S65 W) with no apparent relation to the variable configuration of the coastline.

The lightly indurated ooid sand ridges are several kilometers long and appear to have
originated from the action of long-period waves from a northeasterly Atlantic source.
The chevron ridges contain bands of beach fenestrae, formed by air bubbles trapped
in fine ooid sand inundated by water and quickly indurated. The internal sedimentary
structures including the beach fenestrae and scour structures (Tormey, 2015) show that
the chevrons were rapidly emplaced by water rather than wind (Hearty et al., 1998).
These landforms were deposited near the end of a sea level high stand, when sea
level was just beginning to fall, otherwise they would have been reworked subsequently
by stable or rising seas. Some chevrons contain multiple smaller ridges nested in a
seaward direction (Hearty et al., 1998), providing further evidence that sea level was
falling fast enough to strand and preserve older chevrons as distinct landforms.

Fine-grained carbonate ooids cement rapidly, sometimes within decades to a cen-
tury, if left immobile (Taft et al., 1968; Curran et al., 2008). Additional evidence of the
rapid emplacement of the sand ridges is inferred from burial of large trees and fronds
in living positions (Neumann and Hearty, 1996; Hearty and Olson, 2011). Fenestrae
are abundant primarily in the youngest 5e beds throughout the eastern margin of the
Bahamas.

Older ridges adjacent to the chevron ridges have wave runup deposits that reach
heights nearly 40 m above present sea level, far above the reach of a quiescent 5e sea
surface. Such elevated beach fenestrae are considered to result from runup of very
large waves (Wanless and Dravis, 1989). These stratigraphically youngest deposits on
the shore-parallel ridges are 1-5 m thick fenestrae-filled seaward-sloping tabular beds
of stage 5e age that mantle older MIS 5e dune deposits (Neumann and Moore, 1975;
Chen at al., 1991; Neumann and Hearty, 1996; Tormey, 2015). Runup beds reach more
than a kilometer from the present coast, mantling the eastern flanks of stage 5e ridges
(Hearty et al., 1998). Bain and Kindler (1994) suggested the fenestrae could be rain-
generated, but the fenestrae at high elevations are widespread and exclusive to the late
5e deposits. They are not commonly found in older dune ridges (Hearty et al., 1998).

Enormous boulders tossed onto an older Pleistocene landscape (Hearty, 1997;
Hearty et al., 1998; Hearty and Neumann, 2001) provide a metric of powerful waves
at the end of stage 5e. Giant displaced boulders (Fig. 1) were deposited in north
Eleuthera, Bahamas near chevron ridges and runup deposits (Hearty, 1997). The boul-
ders are composed of recrystallized oolitic-peloidal limestone of MIS 9 or 11 age (300
400 ky; Kindler and Hearty, 1996; Hearty, 1998). The boulders rest on oolitic sediments
and fossils typical of MIS 5e, and thus were deposited after most of the interglacial had
passed. The maximum age of boulder emplacement is  115120 ky based on their
stratigraphy and association with regressive stage 5e marine, eolian and fossil land
snail (Cerion) deposits (Hearty, 1997; Hearty et al., 1998). Hearty (1997) reasoned
that the boulders were emplaced during the latest substage 5e highstand, while sea
level remained high, because even larger waves would have been required at times of
lower sea level during MIS sub-stages 5c and 5a in order to lift the boulders over the
cliffs.

The boulders must have been transported to their present position by waves, as two
of the largest ones (Fig. 1) are located on the crest of the islands ridge, eliminating the
possibility that they were moved downward by gravity (Hearty, 1998) or are the karstic
remnants of some ancient landscape. A tsunami conceivably deposited the boulders,
but the area is not near a tectonic plate boundary. The coincidence of a tsunami at the
end-Eemian moment is improbable given the absence of evidence of tsunamis at other
times in the Bahamas and the lack of evidence of tsunamis on the Atlantic Coastal
Plain of the United States. The proximity of run-up deposits and nested chevron ridges
across a broad front of Bahamian islands is clear evidence of a sustained series of
high-energy wave events.

The remarkable size of the boulders in north Eleuthera becomes more comprehensi-
ble upon realization that numerous boulders larger than 10 m3 have been thrown up on
Eleuthera Island by storms during the Holocene (Hearty, 1997). The mass and volume
of the Holocene boulders (the largest  90 m3, Table 4 of Hearty, 1997) are about 10
smaller than the MIS 5e boulders (Table 2 of Hearty, 1997). Hearty (1998) notes that the

large 5e and Holocene boulders are all located at the apex of a narrowing horseshoe-
shaped submerged embayment (Fig. 2 of Hearty, 1997). Long period ocean waves are
funneled into this embayment, generating huge surge and splash even today as they
impact the cliffs near the Glass Window Bridge.

Movement of these sediments, including chevrons, run-up deposits and boulders,
required a potent sustained energy source. Anticipating our interpretation in terms of
powerful storms driven by an unusually warm tropical ocean and strong zonal tempera-
ture gradients in the North Atlantic, we must ask whether there should not be evidence
of comparable end-Eemian storms in Bermuda. Indeed, there are seaward sloping pla-
nar beds rising to about +20 m along several kilometers of the north coast of Bermuda
(Land et al., 1967; Vacher and Rowe, 1997; Hearty et al., 1998). These beds, from the
latest stage 5e, are filled with beach fenestrae in platy grains and thick air-filled lami-
nations, in marked contrast to older stage 5 sedimentary structures that underlie them
(Hearty et al., 1998). Meter-scale, subtidal cross beds comprise the seaward facies
of the elevated beach beds, reflecting an interval of exceptional wave energy on the
normally tranquil, shallow and broad north shore platform of Bermuda.

Given the geologic evidence of high seas and storminess from Bermuda and the Ba-
hamas, Hearty and Neumann (2001) suggested Steeper pressure, temperature, and
moisture gradients adjacent to warm tropical waters could presumably spawn larger
and more frequent cyclonic storms in the North Atlantic than those seen today. We
now seek further evidence related to the question of whether powerful end-Eemian
storms in the North Atlantic may have dispersed long-period, well-organized waves to
the southwest.

2.3 End-Eemian evidence from North Atlantic sediment cores

Sediment cores from multiple locations provide information not only on ocean temper-
ature and circulation changes (Fig. 2), but also changes on ice sheet destabilization
inferred from ice rafted debris. Comparison of data from different sites is affected by
inaccuracy in absolute dating and use of different age models. Dating of sediments is

usually based on tuning to the time scale of Earth orbital variations (Martinson et al.,
1987) or wiggle-matching to another record (Sirocko et al., 2005), which limits ac-
curacy to several ky. Temporal resolution is limited by bioturbation of sediments; thus
resolution varies with core location and climate (Keigwin and Jones, 1994). For exam-
ple, high deposition rates during ice ages at the Bermuda Rise yield a resolution of
a few decades, but low sedimentation rates during the Eemian yield a resolution of
a few centuries (Lehman et al., 2002). Lateral transport of sedimentary material prior
to deposition complicates data interpretation and can introduce uncertainty, as argued
specifically regarding data from the Bermuda Rise (Ohkouchi et al., 2002; Engelbrecht
and Sachs, 2005).
Adkins et al. (1997) analyzed sediment core (MD95-2036, 34 N, 58 W) from the
Bermuda Rise using an age model based on Martinson et al. (1987) orbital tuning
with the MIS stage 5/6 transition set at 131 ky b2k and the stage 5d/5e transition at
114 ky b2k. They found that oxygen isotope 18O of planktonic (near-surface dwelling)
foraminifera and benthic (deep ocean) foraminifera both attain full interglacial values at
15  128 ky b2k and remain nearly constant for  10 ky (their Fig. 2). Adkins et al. (1997)
infer that: Late within isotope stage 5e ( 118 ky b2k), there is a rapid shift in oceanic
conditions in the western North Atlantic. . .  They find in the sediments at that point
an abrupt increase of clays indicative of enhanced land-based glacier melt and an in-
crease of high nutrient southern source waters. The latter change implies a shutdown
or diminution of NADW formation that allows Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) to push
into the deep North Atlantic Ocean (Duplessy et al., 1988; Govin et al., 2009). Adkins
et al. (1997) continue: The rapid deep and surface hydrographic changes found in this
core mark the end of the peak interglacial and the beginning of climate deterioration
towards the semi-glacial stage 5d. Before and immediately after this event, signaling
the impeding end of stage 5e, deep-water chemistry is similar to modern NADW. This
last sentence refers to a temporary rebound to near interglacial conditions. In Sect. 5
we use accurately synchronized Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, which also reveal

this temporary end-Eemian climate rebound, to interpret the glacial inception and its
relation to ice melt and late-Eemian sea level rise.

Ice rafted debris (IRD) found in ocean cores provides a useful climate diagnostic
tool (Heinrich, 1988; Hemming, 2004). Massive ice rafting (Heinrich) events are of-
ten associated with decreased NADW production and shutdown or slowdown of the
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (Broecker, 2002; Barrieiro et al.,
2008; Srokosz et al., 2012). However, ice rafting occurs on a continuum of scales,
and significant IRD is found in the cold phase of all the 24 DansgaardOeschger (D
O) climate oscillations first identified in Greenland ice cores (Dansgaard et al., 1993).
DO events exhibit rapid warming on Greenland of at least several degrees within a
few decades or less, followed by cooling over a longer period. Chapman and Shackle-
ton (1999) found IRD events in the NEAP18K core for all DO events (C19C24) within
the core interval that they studied, and they also labeled two additional events (C25
and C26). C26 did not produce identifiable IRD at the NEAP18K site, but it was added
to the series because of its strong surface cooling.

Lehman et al. (2002) quantify the C26 cooling event using the same Bermuda Rise
core (MD95-2036) and age model as Adkins et al. (1997). Based on the alkenone
paleo-temperature technique (Sachs and Lehman, 1999), Lehman et al. (2002) find
a sharp sea surface temperature (SST) decrease of  3 C (their Fig. 1) at  118 ky
BP, coinciding with the end-Eemian shoulder of the benthic 18O plateau that defines
stage 5e in the deep ocean. The SST partially recovered after several centuries, but
C26 marked the start of a long slide into the depths of stage 5d cold, as ice sheets
grew and sea level fell  50 m in 10 ky (Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Rohling et al.,
2009). Lehman et al. (2002) wiggle-match the MD95-2036 and NEAP18K cores, find-
ing a simple adjustment to the age model of Chapman and Shackleton (1999) that
maximizes correlation of the benthic 18O records with the Adkins et al. (1997) 18O
record. Specifically, they adjust the NEAP time scale by +4 ky before the MIS 5b 18O
minimum and by +2 ky after it, which places C26 cooling at 118 ky b2k in both records.

They give preference to the Adkins et al. (1997) age scale because it employs a 230Th-
based time scale between 100 and 130 ky b2k.

We do not assert that the end-Eemian C-26 cooling was necessarily at 118 ky b2k,
but we suggest that the strong rapid cooling observed in several sediment cores in this
region of the subtropical and midlatitude North Atlantic Drift at about this time were all
probably the same event. Such a large cooling lasting for centuries would not likely be
confined to a small region. The dating models in several other studies place the date
of the end-Eemian shoulder of the deep ocean 18O and an accompanying surface
cooling event in the range 116118 ky b2k.
Kandiano et al. (2004) and Bauch and Kandiano (2007) analyze core M23414 (53 N,
17 W), west of Ireland, finding a major SST end-Eemian cooling that they identify as
C26 and place at 117 ky b2k. The 1 ky change in the timing of this event compared with
Lehman et al. (2002), is due to a minor change in the age model, specifically, Bauch
and Kandiano say: The original age model of MD95-2036 (Lehman et al., 2002) has
been adjusted to our core M23414 by alignment of the 4 per mil level in the benthic
18O records (at 130 ka in M23414) and the prominent C24 event in both cores. Bauch
and Erlenkeuser (2008) and H. Bauch et al. (2012) examine ocean cores along the
North Atlantic Current including its continuation into the Nordic seas. They find that in
the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Sea, unlike middle latitudes, the Eemian was
warmest near the end of the interglacial period. The age model employed by Bauch and
Erlenkeuser (2008) has the Eemian about 2 ky younger than the Adkins et al. (1997)
age model, Bauch and Erlenkeuser (2008) having the benthic 18O plateau at  116
124 ky BP (their Fig. 6). Rapid cooling they illustrate there at  116.6 ky BP for core
M23071 on the Voring Plateau (67 N, 3 E) likely corresponds to the C26 end-Eemian
cooling event.

Identification of end-Eemian cooling in ocean cores is hampered by the fact that
Eemian North Atlantic climate was more variable than in the Holocene (Fronval and
Jansen, 1996). There were at least three cooling events within the Eemian, each with
minor increases in IRD, which are labeled C27, C27a and C27b by Oppo et al. (2006);

see their Fig. 2 for core site ODP-980 in the eastern North Atlantic (55 N, 15 W) near
Ireland. High (sub-centennial) resolution cores in the Eirik drift region (MD03-2664,
57 N,49 W) near the southern tip of Greenland reveal an event with rapid cooling
accompanied by reduction in NADW production (Irvali et al., 2012; Galaasen et al.,
2014), which they place at  117 ky b2k. However, their age scale has the benthic 18O
shoulder at  115 ky b2k (Fig. S1 in the Supplement, Galaasen et al., 2014), so that
event may have been C27b with C26 being stronger cooling that occurred thereafter.

2.4 Eemian timing consistency with insolation anomalies

Glacial-interglacial climate cycles are affected by insolation change, as shown persua-
sively by Hays et al. (1976) and discussed in Sect. 5.1. Each termination (Broecker,
1984) of glacial conditions in the past several hundred thousand years coincided with
a large positive warm-season insolation anomaly at the latitude of North American and
Eurasian ice sheets (Raymo, 1997; Paillard, 2001). The explanation is that positive
summer insolation anomalies (negative in winter) favor increased summer melting and
reduced winter snowfall, thus shrinking ice sheets.

Termination timing is predicted better by high Northern Hemisphere late spring
(AprilMayJune) insolation than by summer anomalies. For example, Raymo (1997)
places Terminations I and II (preceding the Holocene and Eemian) midpoints at 13.5
and 128131 ky b2k. Late spring insolation maxima are at 13.2 and 129.5 ky b2k
(Fig. 4a). The AICC2012 ice core chronology (Bazin et al., 2013) places Termination
II at 128.5 ky b2k, with 2 uncertainty 3.2 ky. Late spring irradiance maximizes warm-
season ice melt by producing the earliest feasible warm-season ice sheet darkening
via snow melt and snow recrystallization (Hansen et al., 2007b).

Late Eemian sea level rise is seemingly a paradox, because glacial-interglacial sea
level change is mainly a result of the growth and decay of Northern Hemisphere ice
sheets. Northern warm-season insolation anomalies were negative and declining in
the latter part of the Eemian (Fig. 3a), so Northern Hemisphere ice sheets should have
been growing. We suggest that the explanation for a mid-Eemian sea level minimum is

a substantial late-Eemian collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet facilitated by the positive
warm-season insolation anomaly on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean during the late
Eemian (Fig. 3b).

Persuasive presentation of this interpretation requires analysis of relevant climate
mechanisms with a global model as well as a detailed discussion of paleoclimate data.
We will show that these analyses in turn help to explain ongoing climate change today,
with implications for continuing climate change this century.

3 Simulations of 18502300 climate change

We make simulations for 18502300 with radiative forcings that were used for IPCC
(2007, 2013) studies. This allows comparison with simulations made for prior studies.

3.1 Climate model

15

20

Simulations are made with an improved version of a coarse-resolution model that al-
lows long runs at low cost, GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) model E-R.
The atmosphere model is the documented modelE (Schmidt et al., 2006). The ocean
is based on the Russell et al. (1995) model that conserves water and salt mass, has a
free surface with divergent flow, uses a linear upstream scheme for advection, allows
flow through 12 sub-resolution straits, has background diffusivity 0.3 cm2 s1, 4  5
resolution and 13 layers that increase in thickness with depth.

However, the ocean model includes simple but significant changes, compared with
the version documented in simulations by Miller et al. (2014). First, an error in the
calculation of neutral surfaces in the GentMcWilliams (GM, Gent and McWilliams,
1990) mesoscale eddy parameterization was corrected; the resulting increased slope
of neutral surfaces provides proper leverage to the restratification process and correctly
orients eddy stirring along those surfaces.

Second,

the calculation of eddy diffusivity Kmeso for GM following Visbeck et
al. (1997) was simplified to use a length scale independent of the density structure
(J. Marshall, personal communication, 2014):
Kmeso = C/[Teady  f (latitude)]
(1)
where C = (27.9 km)2, Eady growth rate 1/Teady = {|S  N|}, S is the neutral surface
slope, N the BruntVaisala frequency, { } signifies averaging over the upper D meters
of ocean depth, D = min(max(depth, 400 m), 1000 m), and f (latitude) = max(0.1, sin(|
latitude |)) to qualitatively mimic the larger values of the Rossby radius of deformation
at low latitudes. These choices for Kmeso, whose simplicity is congruent with the use of
a depth-independent eddy diffusivity and the use of 1/Teady as a metric of eddy energy,
result in the zonal average diffusivity shown in Fig. 4.

Third, the so-called nonlocal terms in the KPP mixing parameterization (Large et al.,
1994) were activated. All of these modifications tend to increase the ocean stratifica-
tion, and in particular the Southern Ocean state is improved by the GM modifications.
However, as is apparent in Fig. 4, drift in the Southern Ocean state leads to a modest
reduction of the eddy diffusivities over the first 500 years of spin-up. Overall realism of
the ocean circulation is improved, but significant model deficiencies remain, as we will
describe.
The simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has maximum
flux that varies within the range  1418 Sv in the model control run (Figs. 5 and 6).
AMOC strength in recent observations is 17.5 1.6 Sv (Baringer et al., 2013; Srokosz
et al., 2012), based on eight years (20042011) data for an in situ mooring array
(Rayner et al., 2011; Johns et al., 2011).

Ocean model control run initial conditions are climatology for temperature and salinity
(Levitus and Boyer, 1994; Levitus et al., 1994); atmospheric composition is that of 1880
(Hansen et al., 2011). Overall model drift from control run initial conditions is moderate
(see Fig. S2 for planetary energy imbalance and global temperature), but there is drift
in the North Atlantic circulation. The AMOC circulation cell initially is confined to the

upper 3 km at all latitudes (1st century in Figs. 5 and 6), but by the 5th century the cell
reaches deeper at high latitudes.

Atmospheric and surface climate in the present model is similar to the documented
modelE-R, but because of changes to the ocean model we provide several diagnostics
in the Supplement. A notable flaw in the simulated surface climate is the unrealistic
double precipitation maximum in the tropical Pacific (Fig. S3). This double ITCZ (in-
tertropical convergence zone) occurs in many models and is related to the difficulty of
producing realistic stratus clouds in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Another flaw is unre-
alistic hemispheric sea ice, with too much sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere and too
little in the Southern Hemisphere (Figs. S4 and S5). Excessive Northern Hemisphere
sea ice might be caused by deficient poleward heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean
(Fig. S6). However, the AMOC has realistic strength and Atlantic meridional heat trans-
port is only slightly below observations at high latitudes (Fig. S6). Thus we suspect
that the problem may lie in sea ice parameterizations or deficient dynamical transport
of ice out of the Arctic. The deficient Southern Hemisphere sea ice, at least in part,
is likely related to excessive poleward (southward) transport of heat by the simulated
global ocean (Fig. S6), which is related to deficient northward transport of heat in the
modeled Atlantic Ocean (Fig. S6).

A key characteristic of the model and the real world is the response time: how fast
does the surface temperature adjust to a climate forcing, i.e., an imposed perturba-
tion of the planets energy balance? ModelE-R response is about 40 % in five years
(Fig. 7) and 60 % in 100 years, with the remainder requiring many centuries. Hansen
et al. (2011) concluded that most ocean models, including modelE-R, mix a surface
temperature perturbation downward too efficiently and thus have a slower surface re-
sponse than the real world. The basis for this conclusion was empirical analysis using
climate response functions, with 50, 75 and 90 % response at year 100 for climate sim-
ulations (Hansen et al., 2011). Earths measured energy imbalance in recent years and
global temperature change in the past century revealed that the response function with

75 % response in 100 years provided a much better fit with observations than the other
choices.

Durack et al. (2012) compared observations of how rapidly surface salinity changes
are mixed into the deeper ocean with the large number of global models in the CMIP3
(Climate Model Intercomparison Project), reaching a similar conclusion, that the mod-
els mix too rapidly.

Our present ocean model has a faster response on 1075 year time scales than the
old model (Fig. 7), but the change is small. Although the climate response time in our
model is comparable to that in many other ocean models (Hansen et al., 2011), we
believe that it is likely slower than the response in the real world on time scales of a few
decades and longer. A too slow surface response could result from excessive small
scale mixing. We will suggest, after the studies below, that excessive mixing has other
consequences, e.g., causing the effect of freshwater stratification on slowing AABW
formation and growth of Antarctic sea ice cover to occur 12 decades later than in the
real world. Similarly, excessive mixing may make the AMOC in the model less sensitive
to freshwater forcing than the real world AMOC.

3.2 Experiment definition: exponentially increasing fresh water
Freshwater injection is specified as 360 Gt yr1 (1 mm sea level) in 20032015, then
growing with 5, 10 or 20 year doubling time (Fig. 8). Injection ends when input to global
sea level reaches 1 or 5 m. The sharp cut-off aids separation of immediate forcing
effects and feedbacks.

We do not argue for this specific input function, but we suggest that rapid meltwater
increase is likely if GHGs continue to grow rapidly. Greenland and Antarctica have
outlet glaciers occupying canyons with bedrock below sea level well back into the ice
sheet (Fretwell et al., 2013; Morlighem et al., 2014; Pollard et al., 2015). Feedbacks,
including ice sheet darkening due to surface melt (Hansen et al., 2007b; Robinson
et al., 2012; Tedesco et al., 2013; Box et al., 2012) and lowering and thus warming
of the near-coastal ice sheet surface, make increasing ice melt likely. Paleoclimate

data reveal instances of sea level rise of several meters in a century (Fairbanks, 1989;
Deschamps et al., 2012). Those cases involved ice sheets at lower latitudes, but 21st
century climate forcing is larger and increasing much more rapidly.

Radiative forcings are those of Hansen et al. (2007c), based on data through 2003
and IPCC scenario A1B for later GHGs. A1B is an intermediate IPCC scenario over
the century, but on the high side early this century (Fig. 2, Hansen et al., 2007c). We
add freshwater to the North Atlantic (ocean area within 5272 N and 15 E65 N) or
Southern Ocean (ocean south of 60 S), or equally divided between the two oceans.
Ice sheet discharge (icebergs plus meltwater) is mixed as fresh water with mean tem-
perature 15 C into top three ocean layers (Fig. S7).

3.3 Simulated surface temperature and energy balance

We present surface temperature and planetary energy balance first, thus providing a
global overview. Then we examine changes in ocean circulation and compare results
with prior studies.

Temperature change in 2065, 2080 and 2096 for 10 year doubling time (Fig. 9) should
be thought of as results when sea level rise reaches 0.6, 1.7 and 5 m, because the
dates depend on initial freshwater flux. Actual current freshwater flux may be about a
factor of four higher than assumed in these initial runs, as we will discuss, and thus
effects may occur  20 years earlier. A sea level rise of 5 m in a century is about the
most extreme in the paleo record (Fairbanks, 1989; Deschamps et al., 2012), but the
assumed 21st century climate forcing is also more rapidly growing than any known
natural forcing.

Meltwater injected on the North Atlantic has larger initial impact, but Southern Hemi-
sphere ice melt has a greater global effect for larger melt as the effectiveness of more
meltwater in the North Atlantic begins to decline. The global effect is large long before
sea level rise of 5 m is reached. Meltwater reduces global warming about half by the
time sea level rise reaches 1.7 m. Cooling due to ice melt more than eliminates A1B
warming in large areas of the globe.

The large cooling effect of ice melt does not decrease much as the ice melting rate
varies between doubling times of 5, 10 or 20 years (Fig. 10a). In other words, the cu-
mulative ice sheet melt, rather than the rate of ice melt, largely determines the climate
impact for the range of melt rates covered by 5, 10 and 20 year doubling times. Thus if
ice sheet loss occurs even to an extent of 1.7 m sea level rise (Fig. 10b), a large impact
on climate and climate change is predicted.

Greater global cooling occurs for freshwater injected on the Southern Ocean, but the
cooling lasts much longer for North Atlantic injection (Fig. 10a). That persistent cooling,
mainly at Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes (Fig. S8), is a consequence
of the sensitivity, hysteresis effects, and long recovery time of the AMOC (Stocker and
Wright, 1991; Rahmstorf, 1995 and earlier studies referenced therein). AMOC changes
are described below.

When freshwater injection on the Southern Ocean is halted, global temperature
jumps back within two decades to the value it would have had without any freshwa-
ter addition (Fig. 10a). Quick recovery is consistent with the Southern Ocean-centric
picture of the global overturning circulation (Fig. 4, Talley, 2013), as the Southern Merid-
ional Overturning Circulation (SMOC), driven by AABW formation, responds to change
of the vertical stability of the ocean column near Antarctica (see Sect. 4) and the ocean
mixed layer and sea ice have limited thermal inertia.
Global cooling due to ice melt causes a large increase in Earths energy imbalance
(Fig. 10b), adding about +2 W m2, which is larger than the imbalance caused by in-
creasing GHGs. Thus, although the cold fresh water from ice sheet disintegration pro-
vides a negative feedback on regional and global surface temperature, it increases the
planets energy imbalance, thus providing more energy for ice melt (Hansen, 2005).
This added energy is pumped into the ocean.

Increased downward energy flux at the top of the atmosphere is not located in the
regions cooled by ice melt. On the contrary, those regions suffer a large reduction of
net incoming energy (Fig. 11a). The regional energy reduction is a consequence of
increased cloud cover (Fig. 11b) in response to the colder ocean surface. However,

the colder ocean surface reduces upward radiative, sensible and latent heat fluxes,
thus causing a large ( 50 W m2) increase of energy into the North Atlantic and a
substantial but smaller flux into the Southern Ocean (Fig. 11c).

Below we conclude that the principal mechanism by which this ocean heat increases
ice melt is via its effect on ice shelves. Discussion requires examination of how the
freshwater injections alter the ocean circulation and internal ocean temperature.

3.4 Simulated AMOC

|

Broeckers articulation of likely effects of freshwater outbursts in the North Atlantic on
ocean circulation and global climate (Broecker, 1990; Broecker et al., 1990) spurred
quantitative studies with idealized ocean models (Stocker and Wright, 1991) and
global atmosphere-ocean models (Manabe and Stouffer, 1995; Rahmstorf 1995, 1996).
Scores of modeling studies have since been carried out, many reviewed by Barreiro et
al. (2008), and observing systems are being developed to monitor modern changes in
the AMOC (Carton and Hakkinen, 2011).

Our climate simulations in this section are 5 member ensembles of runs initiated at
25 year intervals at years 9011001 of the control run. We chose this part of the control
run because the planet is then in energy balance (Fig. S2), although by that time model
drift had altered the slow deep ocean circulation. Some model drift away from initial
climatological conditions is inevitable, as all models are imperfect, and we carry out the
experiments with cognizance of model limitations. However, there is strong incentive
to seek basic improvements in representation of physical processes to reduce drift in
future versions of the model.

GHGs alone (scenario A1B) slow AMOC by the early 21st century (Fig. 12), but
variability among individual runs (Fig. S9) would make definitive detection difficult at
present. Freshwater injected onto the North Atlantic or in both hemispheres shuts down
the AMOC (Fig. 12, right side). GHG amounts are fixed after 2100 and ice melt is zero,
but after two centuries of stable climate forcing the AMOC has not recovered to its

earlier state. This slow recovery was found in the earliest simulations by Manabe and
Stouffer (1994) and Rahmstorf (1995, 1996).

Freshwater injection already has a large impact when ice melt is a fraction of 1 m
of sea level. By the time sea level rise reaches 59 cm (2065 in the present scenarios),
when fresh water flux is 0.48 Sv, the impact on AMOC is already large, consistent with
the substantial surface cooling in the North Atlantic (Fig. 9).

3.5 Comparison with prior simulations

|

AMOC sensitivity to GHG forcing has been examined extensively based on IPCC stud-
ies. Schmittner et al. (2005) found that AMOC weakened 25 25 % by the end of the
21st century in 28 simulations of 9 different models forced by the A1B emission sce-
nario. Gregory et al. (2005) found 1050 % AMOC weakening in 11 models for CO2
quadrupling (1 % yr1 increase for 140 years), with largest decreases in models with
strong AMOCs. Weaver et al. (2007) found a 1531 % AMOC weakening for CO2 qua-
drupling in a single model for 17 climate states differing in initial GHG amount. AMOC
in our model weakens 30 % between 19902000 and 20902100, the period used by
Schmittner et al. (2005), for A1B forcing (Fig. S9). Thus our model is more sensitive
than the average, but within the range of other models, a conclusion that continues to
be valid in comparison with 10 CMIP5 models (Cheng et al., 2013).

AMOC sensitivity to freshwater forcing has not been compared as systematically
among models. Several studies find little impact of Greenland melt on AMOC (Huy-
brechts et al., 2002; Jungclaus et al., 2006; Vizcaino et al., 2008) while others find
substantial North Atlantic cooling (Fichefet et al., 2003; Swingedouw et al., 2007; Hu
et al., 2009, 2011). Studies with little impact calculated or assumed small ice sheet
melt rates, e.g., Greenland contributed only 4 cm of sea level rise in the 21st century
in the ice sheet model of Huybrechts et al. (2002). Fichefet et al. (2003), using nearly
the same atmosphere-ocean model as Huybrechts et al. (2002) but a more responsive
ice sheet model, found AMOC weakening from 20 to 13 Sv late in the 21st century, but
separate contributions of ice melt and GHGs to AMOC slowdown were not defined.

Hu et al. (2009, 2011) use the A1B scenario and freshwater from Greenland starting
at 1 mm sea level per year increasing 7 % yr1, similar to our 10 year doubling case. Hu
et al. keep the melt rate constant after it reaches 0.3 Sv (in 2050), yielding 1.65 m sea
level rise in 2100 and 4.2 m in 2200. Global warming found by Hu et al. (2009, 2010) for
scenario A1B resembles our result but is 2030 % smaller (compare Fig. 2b of Hu et
al., 2009 to our Fig. 9), and cooling they obtain from the freshwater flux is moderately
less than that in our model. AMOC is slowed about one-third by the latter 21st century
in the Hu et al. (2011) 7 % yr1 experiment, comparable to our result.

General consistency holds for other quantities, such as changes of precipitation.
Our model yields southward shifting of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
and intensification of the subtropical dry region with increasing GHGs (Fig. S10), as
has been reported in modeling studies of Swingedouw et al. (2007, 2009) and others
(IPCC, 2013). These effects are intensified by ice melt and cooling in the North Atlantic
region (Fig. S10).

A recent 5-model study (Swingedouw et al., 2014) finds a small effect on AMOC
for 0.1 Sv Greenland freshwater flux added in 2050 to simulations with a strong GHG
forcing. Our larger response is likely due, at least in part, to our freshwater flux reaching
several tenths of a Sv.

Freshwater sensitivity in our model is similar to an earlier version of the model used
to simulate the 8.2 ky b2k freshwater event associated with demise of the Hudson
Bay ice dome (LeGrande et al., 2006). The  50 % AMOC slowdown in that model,
in response to forcings of 2.55 Sv years indicated by geologic and paleohydraulic
studies (e.g., Clarke et al, 2004), is consistent with indications from isotope-enabled
analyses of the 8.2 ky event (LeGrande and Schmidt, 2008) and sediment records
from the northwest Atlantic (Kleiven et al., 2008). The 12 century AMOC recovery
time in numerical experiments (LeGrande and Schmidt, 2008) seems consistent with
the 160 year duration of the 8.2 ky cooling event (Rasmussen et al., 2013).

3.6 Storm-related model diagnostics

5

Ice melt in the North Atlantic creates a substantial increment toward higher sea level
pressure in the North Atlantic region in all seasons (Fig. 13). In the summer the added
surface pressure strengthens and moves northward the Bermuda high pressure system
(Fig. S3). Circulation around the high pressure creates strong prevailing northeasterly
winds in the North Atlantic at the latitudes of Bermuda and the Bahamas. A1B climate
forcing alone (top row of Fig. S11) has only a small impact on the winds, but cold
meltwater in the North Atlantic causes a strengthening and poleward shift of the high
pressure.
The high pressure in the model is located further east than appropriate for producing
the fastest possible winds at the Bahamas. Our coarse resolution (4  5) model, which
slightly misplaces the pressure maximum for todays climate, may be partly responsible
for the displacement. However, the location of high pressure also depends meltwater
placement, which we spread uniformly over all longitudes in the North Atlantic between
65 W and 15 E and on specific location of ocean currents and surface temperature
during the Eemian.

Our results at least imply that strong cooling in the North Atlantic from AMOC shut-
down does create higher wind speed. It would be useful to carry out more detailed
studies with higher resolution climate models including the most realistic possible dis-
tribution of meltwater.

The increment in seasonal mean wind speed of the northeasterlies relative to prein-
dustrial conditions is as much as 1020 %. Such a percentage increase of wind speed
in a storm translates into an increase of storm power dissipation by a factor  1.42,
because wind power dissipation is proportional to the cube of wind speed (Emanuel,
1987, 2005). However, our simulated changes refer to seasonal mean winds averaged
over large grid-boxes, not individual storms.

A blocking high pressure system in the North Atlantic creating consistent strong
northeasterly flow would provide wave action that may have contributed to the chevron

ridge formation in the Bahamas and Bermuda. This blocking high pressure system
could contribute to powerful storm impacts in another way. In combination with the
warm tropical conditions that existed in the late Eemian (Cortijo et al., 1999), and are
expected in the future if GHGs continue to increase, this blocking high pressure could
create a preferred alley for tropical storm tracks.

We assumed, in discussing the relevance of these experiments to Eemian climate,
that effects of freshwater injection dominate over changing GHG amount, as seems
likely because of the large freshwater effect on SSTs and sea level pressure. However,
Eemian CO2 was actually almost constant at  275 ppm (Luthi et al., 2008). Thus, to
isolate effects better, we now carry out simulations with fixed GHG amount, which helps
clarify important feedback processes.

3.7 Pure freshwater experiments

Our pure freshwater experiments are 5 member ensembles starting at years 1001,
1101, 1201, 1301, and 1401 of the control run. Each experiment ran 300 years. Fresh-
water flux in the initial decade averaged 180 km3 yr1 (0.5 mm sea level) in the hemi-
sphere with ice melt and increased with a 10 year doubling time. Freshwater input is
terminated when it reaches 0.5 m sea level rise per hemisphere for three 5-member en-
sembles: two ensembles with injection in the individual hemispheres and one ensemble
with input in both hemispheres (1 m total sea level rise). Three additional ensembles
were obtained by continuing freshwater injection until hemispheric sea level contribu-
tions reached 2.5 m. Here we provide a few model diagnostics central to discussions
that follow. Additional results are provided in Figs. S12S14.

The AMOC shuts down for Northern Hemisphere freshwater input yielding 2.5 m sea
level rise (Fig. 14). By year 300, more than 200 years after cessation of all freshwater
input, AMOC is still far from full recovery for this large freshwater input. On the other
hand, freshwater input of 0.5 m does not cause full shutdown, and AMOC recovery
occurs in less than a century.

Global temperature change (Fig. 15) reflects the fundamentally different impact of
freshwater forcings of 0.5 and 2.5 m. The response also differs greatly depending on
the hemisphere of the freshwater input. The case with freshwater forcing in both hemi-
spheres is shown only in the Supplement because, to a good approximation, the re-
sponse is simply the sum of the responses to the individual hemispheric forcings (see
Figs. S12S14). The sum of responses to hemispheric forcings moderately exceeds
the response to global forcing.

Global cooling continues for centuries for the case with freshwater forcing sufficient to
shut down the AMOC (Fig. 15). If the forcing is only 0.5 m of sea level, the temperature
recovers in a few decades. However, the freshwater forcing required to reach the tipping
point of AMOC shutdown may be less in the real world than in our model, as discussed
below. Global cooling due to freshwater input on the Southern Ocean recovers in a few
years after freshwater input ceases (Fig. 15), for both the smaller (0.5 m of sea level)
and larger (2.5 m) freshwater forcings.

Injection of a large amount of surface freshwater in either hemisphere has a notable
impact on heat uptake by the ocean and the internal ocean heat distribution (Fig. 16).
Despite continuous injection of a large amount of very cold (15 C) water in these pure
freshwater experiments, substantial portions of the ocean interior become warmer.
Tropical and Southern Hemisphere warming is the well-known effect of reduced heat
transport to northern latitudes in response to the AMOC shutdown (Rahmstorf, 1996;
Barreiro et al., 2008).
However, deep warming in the Southern Ocean may have greater consequences.
Warming is maximum at grounding line depths ( 12 km) of Antarctic ice shelves
(Rignot and Jacobs, 2002). Ice shelves near their grounding lines (Fig. 13 of Jenk-
ins and Doake, 1991) are sensitive to temperature of the proximate ocean, with ice
shelf melting increasing 1 m per year for each 0.1 C temperature increase (Rignot and
Jacobs, 2002). The foot of an ice shelf provides most of the restraining force that ice
shelves exert on landward ice (Fig. 14 of Jenkins and Doake, 1991), making ice near
the grounding line the buttress of the buttress. Pritchard et al. (2012) deduce from

satellite altimetry that ice shelf melt has primary control of Antarctic ice sheet mass
loss.
Thus we examine our simulations in more detail (Fig. 17). The pure freshwater ex-
periments add 5 mm sea level in the first decade (requiring an initial 0.346 mm yr1
for 10 year doubling), 10 mm in the second decade, and so on (Fig. 17a). Cumulative
freshwater injection reaches 0.5 m in year 68 and 2.5 m in year 90.
AABW formation is reduced  20 % by year 68 and  50 % by year 90 (Fig. 17b).
When freshwater injection ceases, AABW formation rapidly regains full strength, in
contrast to the long delay in reestablishing NADW formation after AMOC shutdown.
The response time of the Southern Ocean mixed layer dictates the recovery time for
AABW formation. Thus rapid recovery also applies to ocean temperature at depths of
ice shelf grounding lines (Fig. 17c).

The rapid response of the SMOC (within a decade) to a change of the density of the
Southern Ocean mixed layer implies that the rate of freshwater addition to the mixed
layer is the driving factor. We will argue below that our model, because of excessive
small scale mixing, probably understates the mixed layer and SMOC sensitivities to
freshwater flux change, and in a later section we present evidence that the real world
is responding more quickly than the model.

Sea ice cover, accurately monitored from satellites since the late 1970s, is a key diag-
nostic of the ocean surface layer. Increasing sea ice cover, we show below, is a powerful
feedback that amplifies ice shelf melt. Freshwater flux has little effect on our simulated
Northern Hemisphere sea ice until the 7th decade of freshwater growth (Fig. 17d), but
Southern Hemisphere sea ice is more sensitive, with substantial response in the 5th
decade and large response in the 6th decade.
Is 5th decade freshwater flux (2880 Gt yr1) of relevance to todays world? Yes, we
will conclude, the Southern Ocean is already experiencing at least 5th decade fresh-
water forcing. We explain the basis of that conclusion below, and then make a climate
simulation for the 21st century with more realistic forcings than in our prior simulations.

4 Simulations to 2100 with modified (more realistic) forcings

Recent data imply that current ice melt is larger than assumed in our 18502300 cli-
mate simulations. Thus we make an additional simulation and use the opportunity to
make minor improvements in the radiative forcing.

4.1 Advanced (earlier) freshwater injection

Atmosphere-ocean climate models, including ours, commonly include a fixed freshwa-
ter flux from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to the ocean. This flux is chosen to
balance snow accumulation in the models control run, with the rationale that approxi-
mate balance is expected between net accumulation and mass loss including icebergs
and ice shelf melting. Global warming creates a mass imbalance that we want to inves-
tigate. Ice sheet models can calculate the imbalance, but it is unclear how reliably ice
sheet models simulate ice sheet disintegration. We forgo ice sheet modeling, instead
adding a growing freshwater amount to polar oceans with alternative growth rates and
initial freshwater amount estimated from available data.

Change of freshwater flux on the ocean in a warming world with shrinking ice sheets
consists of two terms, Term 1 being net ice melt and Term 2 being change of P-E
(precipitation minus evaporation) over the relevant ocean. Term 1 includes land based
ice mass loss, which can be detected by satellite gravity measurements, loss of ice
shelves, and net sea ice mass change. Term 2 is calculated in a climate model forced
by changing atmospheric composition, but it is not included in our pure freshwater
experiments that have no global warming.
IPCC (2013, Chapter 4) estimated land ice loss in Antarctica that increased from
30 Gt yr1 in 19922001 to 147 Gt yr1 in 20022011 and in Greenland from 34 to
215 Gt yr1, with uncertainties discussed by IPCC (2013). Gravity satellite data suggest
Greenland ice sheet mass loss  300400 Gt yr1 in the past few years (Barletta et
al., 2013). A newer analysis of gravity data for 20032013 (Velicogna et al., 2014),

discussed in more detail in Sect. 6, finds a Greenland mass loss 280 58 Gt yr1 and
Antarctic mass loss 67 44 Gt yr1.

One estimate of net ice loss from Antarctica, including ice shelves, is obtained by
surveying and adding the mass flux from all ice shelves and comparing this freshwater
mass loss with the freshwater mass gain from the continental surface mass budget.
Rignot et al. (2013) and Depoorter et al. (2013) independently assessed the fresh-
water mass fluxes from Antarctic ice shelves. Their respective estimates for the basal
melt are 1500 237 and 1454 174 Gt yr1. Their respective estimates for calving are
1265 139 and 1321 144 Gt yr1.
This estimated freshwater loss via the ice shelves ( 2800 Gt yr1) is larger than
freshwater gain by the Antarctic surface. Vaughan et al. (1999) estimated the net sur-
face mass balance of the continent as +1811 and +2288 Gt yr1 including precipita-
tion on ice shelves. IPCC (2013) estimates the net Antarctic surface mass balance as
+1983 122 Gt yr1 excluding ice shelves. Thus comparison of continental freshwater
input with ice shelf output suggests a net export of freshwater to the Southern Ocean
of several hundred Gt yr1 in recent years. However, substantial uncertainty exists in
the difference between these two large numbers.

A remarkable independent evaluation has recently been achieved by Rye et
al. (2014) using satellite measured changes of sea level around Antarctica in the period
19922011. Sea level along the Antarctic coast rose 2 mm yr1 faster than the regional
mean sea level rise in the Southern Ocean south of 50 S, an effect that they conclude
is almost entirely a steric adjustment caused by accelerating freshwater discharge from
Antarctica. They conclude that an excess freshwater input of 430 230 Gt yr1, above
the rate needed to maintain a steady ocean salinity, is required. Rye et al. (2014) note
that these values constitute a lower bound for the actual excess discharge above a
steady salinity rate, because numerous in situ data, discussed below, indicate that
freshening began earlier than 1992.

Term 2, change of P-E over the Southern Ocean relative to its pre-industrial amount,
is large in all climate simulations (IPCC, 2013). In our ensemble of runs (using ob-

served GHGs for 18502003 and scenario A1B thereafter) the increase of P-E in the
decade 20112020, relative to the control run, was in the range 3500 to 4000 Gt yr1,
as mean precipitation over the Southern Ocean increased  35 mm yr1 and evapora-
tion decreased  3 mm yr1.

Increasing ice melt and increasing P-E are climate feedbacks, their growth in recent
decades driven by global warming. Our pure freshwater simulations indicate that their
sum, at least 4000 Gt yr1, is sufficient to affect ocean circulation, sea ice cover, and
surface temperature, which can spur other climate feedbacks. We investigate these
feedbacks via climate simulations using improved estimates of freshwater flux from ice
melt. P-E is computed by the model.
We take freshwater injection to be 720 Gt yr1 from Antarctica and 360 Gt yr1 in the
North Atlantic in 2011, with injection rates at earlier and later times defined by assump-
tion of a 10 year doubling time. Resulting mean freshwater injection around Antarctica
in 19922011 is  400 Gt yr1, similar to the estimate of Rye et al. (2014). A recent
estimate of 310 74 km3 volume loss of floating Antarctic ice shelves in 20032012
(Paolo et al., 2015) is not inconsistent, as the radar altimeter data employed for ice
shelves does not include contributions from the ice sheet or fast ice tongues at the
ice shelf grounding line. Greenland ice sheet mass loss provides most of the assumed
360 Gt yr1 freshwater, and this would be supplemented by shrinking ice shelves (Rig-
not and Steffen, 2008) and small ice caps in the North Atlantic and west of Greenland
(Ohmura, 2009) that are losing mass (Abdalati et al., 2004; Bahr et al., 2009).

We add the freshwater around Antarctica at coastal grid boxes (Fig. S15) guided by
the data of Rignot et al. (2013) and Depoorter et al. (2013), the flux in the western
hemisphere from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea being about three times larger than
for the rest of the coastline. Specified freshwater flux around Greenland is similar on
the east and west coasts, and small along the north coast (Fig. S15).

4.2 Modified radiative forcings

Actual GHG forcing has grown slower than scenario A1B, because growth of CH4 and
minor gases declined after IPCC scenarios were defined (Fig. 5, Hansen et al., 2013c,
update at http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/GHGs/). As a simple improvement we de-
creased the A1B CH4 scenario during 20032013 such that subsequent CH4 is re-
duced 100 ppb, thus decreasing the radiative forcing  0.05 W m2.

Stratospheric aerosol forcing to 2014 uses the data set of Sato et al. (1993) as
updated at http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/StratAer/. Future years have constant
aerosol optical depth 0.0052 yielding effective forcing 0.12 W m2, implemented by
using fixed 1997 aerosol data. Tropospheric aerosol growth is assumed to slow
smoothly, leveling out at 2 W m2 in 2100. Future solar forcing is assumed to have
an 11 year cycle with amplitude 0.25 W m2. Net forcing exceeds 5 W m2 by the end
of the 21st century, about three times the current forcing (Fig. 18).

4.3 Climate simulations with modified forcings
Global temperature has a peak at +1.2 C in the 2040s for the modified forcings
(Fig. 19). Ice melt cooling is advanced as global ice melt reaches 1 m of sea level
in 2060, 1/3 from Greenland and 2/3 from Antarctica. Actual sea level rise could be
less than 1 m, depending on the portion of melt from ice shelves (which has little effect
on sea level), but contributions from ocean thermal expansion and mountain glacier
melt would probably make global mean sea level rise at least of the order of 1 m.

Global temperature rise resumes in the 2060s after total cessation of the freshwater
injection. However, termination of freshwater injection is imposed only for the sake of
analyzing climate mechanisms, not with expectation that a sudden halt of ice sheet
disintegration is realistic.

Global temperature becomes an unreliable diagnostic of planetary condition as the
ice melt rate increases. Global energy imbalance (Fig. 19b) is a more meaningful mea-
sure of planetary status as well as an estimate of the climate forcing change required

to stabilize climate. Our calculated present energy imbalance of  0.8 W m2 (Fig. 19b)
is larger than the observed 0.58 0.15 W m2 during 20052010 (Hansen et al., 2011).
The discrepancy is likely accounted for by excessive ocean heat uptake at low latitudes
in our model, a problem related to the models slow surface response time (Fig. 7) that
may be caused by excessive small scale ocean mixing.

Large scale regional cooling occurs in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans by
mid-century (Fig. 20) for 10 year doubling of freshwater injection. A 20 year doubling
places similar cooling near the end of this century, 40 years earlier than in our prior
simulations (Fig. 10), as the factor of four increase of current freshwater from Antarctica
is a 40 year advance.

The critical issue is whether human-spurred ice sheet mass loss can be approxi-
mated as an exponential process during the next few decades. Such nonlinear behav-
ior depends upon amplifying feedbacks, which, indeed, our climate simulations reveal
in the Southern Ocean.

4.4 Southern Ocean feedbacks

Amplifying feedbacks in the Southern Ocean and atmosphere contribute to dramatic
climate change in our simulations (Fig. 20). We first summarize the feedbacks to iden-
tify processes that must be simulated well to draw valid conclusions. While recognizing
the complexity of the global ocean circulation (Lozier, 2012; Lumpkin and Speer, 2007;
Marshall and Speer, 2012; Munk and Wunsch, 1998; Orsi et al., 1999; Sheen et al.,
2014; Talley, 2013; Wunsch and Ferrari, 2004), we use a simple two-dimensional rep-
resentation to discuss the feedbacks.

Climate change includes slowdown of AABW formation, indeed shutdown by midcen-
tury if freshwater injection increases with a doubling time as short as 10 years (Fig. 21).
Implications of AABW shutdown are so great that we must ask whether the mech-
anisms are simulated with sufficient realism in our climate model, which has coarse
resolution and relevant deficiencies that we have noted. After discussing the feedbacks

here, we examine how well the processes are included in our model (Sect. 4.5). Pa-
leoclimate data (Sect. 5) provides much insight about these processes and modern
observations (Sect. 7) show that these feedbacks are already underway.

Large-scale climate processes affecting ice sheets are sketched in Fig. 22. The role
of the ocean circulation in the global energy and carbon cycles is captured to a use-
ful extent by the two-dimensional (zonal mean) overturning circulation featuring deep
water (NADW) and bottom water (AABW) formation in the polar regions. Marshall and
Speer (2012) discuss the circulation based in part on tracer data and analyses by
Lumpkin and Speer (2007). Talley (2013) extends the discussion with diagrams clarify-
ing the role of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Wunsch (2002) emphasizes that the ocean circulation is driven primarily by atmo-
spheric winds and secondarily by tidal stirring. The energy drawing deep water toward
the surface in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 22) is provided by strong circumpolar west-
erly winds. This complex global thermohaline circulation can be altered by natural and
human-made forcings, including freshwater injection from ice sheets, which stimulate
powerful feedback processes.

A key feedback concerns the effect of cold freshwater injection on ocean tempera-
ture at ice shelf grounding lines. In our pure freshwater simulations the freshwater
added to the Southern Ocean acts as a lid that reduces ventilation of ocean heat to the
atmosphere and space. Warming is largest at depths near ice shelf grounding lines,
the portion of the ice shelf that provides most of the restraining force that limits the rate
of ice sheet discharge to the ocean (Fig. 14 of Jenkins and Doake, 1991). Melting at ice
shelf grounding lines in West Antarctica and Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica has po-
tential to result in rapid, nonlinear sea level rise because these basins have retrograde
beds (beds sloping inland), a configuration with potential for unstable grounding line
retreat and substantial ice sheet disintegration (Mercer, 1978), as discussed further
below. Multiple submarine valleys make much of the Greenland ice sheet vulnerable to
thermal forcing by a warming ocean (Morlighem et al., 2014), but with a few exceptions

(Khan et al., 2014) the valleys are prograde and thus rapid nonlinear growth of ice melt
is not likely.

Another feedback occurs via the effect of surface and atmospheric cooling on pre-
cipitation and evaporation over the Southern Ocean. In climate simulations that do not
include increasing freshwater injection in the Southern Ocean (IPCC, 2013), it is found
that snowfall on Antarctica increases substantially in the 21st century, thus providing
a negative term to sea level change. Frieler et al. (2015) assert that 35 global climate
models are consistent in showing that a warming climate will yield increasing Antarc-
tic snow accumulation, but this paleo affirmation refers to slowly changing climate
in quasi-equilibrium with ocean boundary conditions. In our experiments with growing
freshwater injection the increasing sea ice cover and cooling of the Southern Ocean
surface and atmosphere cause the increased precipitation to occur over the Southern
Ocean, rather than over Antarctica. This feedback not only reduces any increase of
snowfall over Antarctica, it also provides a large freshening term to the surface of the
Southern Ocean, thus magnifying the direct freshening effect from increasing ice sheet
melt.

4.5 Models ability to simulate these feedbacks

Realistic representation of these feedbacks places requirements on both the atmo-
sphere and ocean components of our climate model. We discuss first the atmosphere,
then the ocean.

There are two main requirements on the atmospheric model. First, it must simulate
well P-E and changes of P-E, because of its importance for ocean circulation and
the amplifying feedback in the Southern Ocean. Precise verification of P-E is difficult to
attain, but the ultimate model requirement is that it produce realistic sea surface salinity
(SSS) patterns and ongoing changes.

Simulated P-E (Fig. S16b) agrees well with meteorological reanalysis (Fig. 3.4b,
IPCC, 2013). Simulated global sea surface salinity (SSS) patterns (Fig. S16a) agree
well with global ocean surface salinity patterns (Antonov et al., 2010 and Fig. 3.4a,

IPCC, 2013). SSS trends in our simulation (Fig. S16c), with the Pacific on average
becoming fresher while most of the Atlantic and the subtropics in the Southern Hemi-
sphere become saltier, are consistent with observed salinity trends (Durack and Wijf-
fels, 2010). Recent freshening of the Southern Ocean in our simulation is somewhat
less than in observed data (IPCC, Figs. 3.4c and 3.4d), implying that the amplifying
feedback may be underestimated in our simulation. A likely reason for that is discussed
below in conjunction with observed sea ice change.

The second requirement is that the atmospheric model simulate well winds and their
changes, because these drive the ocean. Thus the model must simulate well atmo-
spheric pressure patterns and changes in response to climate forcings. A test is pro-
vided by observed changes of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), with a decrease of
surface pressure near Antarctica and a small increase at mid-latitudes (Marshall, 2003)
that D. Thompson et al. (2011) relate to stratospheric ozone loss and increasing GHGs.
Our climate forcing (Fig. 18) includes ozone change (Fig. 2, Hansen et al., 2007a) with
stratospheric ozone depletion in 19791997 and constant ozone thereafter. Our model
produces a trend toward the high index polarity of SAM (Fig. S17) similar to observa-
tions, although perhaps a slightly smaller change than observed (compare Fig. S17
with Fig. 3 of Marshall, 2003). SAM continues to increase in our model after ozone
stabilizes (Fig. S17), suggesting that GHGs may provide a larger portion of the SAM
response in our model than in the model study of D. Thompson et al. (2011). It would
not be surprising if the stratospheric dynamical response to ozone change were weak
in our model, given the coarse resolution and simplified representation of atmospheric
drag and dynamical effects in the stratosphere (Hansen et al., 2007a), but that is not a
major concern for our present purposes.

The ocean model must be able to simulate realistically the oceans overturning cir-
culation and its response to forcings including freshwater additions. Heuze et al. (2013,
2015) point out that simulated deep convection in the Southern Ocean is unrealistic in
most models, with AABW formation occurring in the open ocean where it rarely occurs
in nature. Our present ocean model contains significant improvements (see Sect. 3.1)

compared to the GISS E2-R model that Heuze et al. include in their comparisons. Thus
we show (Fig. 23) the maximum mixed layer depth in winter (February in the North-
ern Hemisphere and August in the Southern Hemisphere) using the same criterion as
Heuze et al. to define the mixed layer depth, i.e., the layers with a density difference
from the ocean surface layer less than 0.03 kg m3.
Southern Ocean mixing in the model reaches a depth of  500 m in a wide belt near
60 S stretching west from the southern tip of South America, with similar depths south
of Australia. These open ocean mixed layer depths compare favorably with observa-
tions shown in Fig. 2a of Heuze et al. (2015), based on data of de Boyer Montegut et
al. (2004). There is no open ocean deep convection in our model.

Deep convection occurs only along the coast of Antarctica (Fig. 23). Coastal grid
boxes on the continental shelf are a realistic location for AABW formation. Orsi et
al. (1999) suggest that most AABW is formed on shelves around the Weddell-Enderby
Basin (60 %) and shelves of the Adelie-Wilkes Coast and Ross Sea (40 %). Our model
produces mixing down to the shelf in those locations (Fig. 23b), but also on the Amery
Ice Shelf near the location where Ohshima et al. (2013) identified AABW production,
which they term Cape Darnley Bottom Water.
However, with our coarse 4  5 stair step to the ocean bottom the AABW cannot
readily slide down the slope to the ocean floor. As a result, the denser water from the
shelf mixes into the open ocean grid boxes, making our modeled Southern Ocean less
stratified than the real world (cf. temporal drift of Southern Ocean salinity in Fig. S18),
because the denser water must move several degrees of latitude horizontally before it
can move deeper. Nevertheless, our Southern Ocean is sufficiently stratified to avoid
the unrealistic open ocean convection that infects many models (Heuze et al., 2013).

Orsi et al. (1999) estimate the AABW formation rate in several ways, obtaining values
in the range 812 Sv, larger than our modeled 56 Sv (Fig. 21). However, as in most
models (Heuze et al., 2015) our SMOC diagnostic (Fig. 21) is the mean (Eulerian)
circulation, i.e., excluding eddy-induced transport. Rerun of a 20 year segment of our
control run to save eddy-induced changes reveals an increase of SMOC at 72 S by 1

2 Sv, with negligible change at middle and low latitudes, making our simulated transport
close to the range estimated by Orsi et al. (1999).

We conclude that the climate model can potentially simulate Southern Ocean feed-
backs that magnify the effect of freshwater injection onto the Southern Ocean: the P-E
feedback that wrenches global-warming-enhanced water vapor from the air before it
reaches the Antarctic continent and the AABW slowdown that traps deep ocean heat,
leaving that heat at levels where it accelerates ice shelf melting. Indeed, we will argue
that both of these feedbacks are probably underestimated in our current model.

The model seems less capable in Northern Hemisphere polar regions. Deep con-
vection today is believed to occur mainly in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN)
Sea and at the southern end of Baffin Bay (Fig. 2b, Heuze et al., 2015). In our model,
perhaps because of excessive sea ice in those regions, open ocean deep convection
occurs to the southeast of the southern tip of Greenland and at less deep grid boxes
between that location and the United Kingdom (Fig. 23). Mixing reaching the ocean
floor on the Siberian Coast in our model (Fig. 23) may be realistic, as coastal polynya
are observed on the Siberian continental shelf (D. Bauch et al., 2012). However, the
winter mixed layer on the Alaska south coast is unrealistically deep (Fig. 23). These
model limitations must be kept in mind in interpreting simulated Northern Hemisphere
climate change.

5 Implications of paleoclimate data

Paleoclimate data are essential for understanding the major climate feedbacks. Pro-
cesses of special importance are: (1) the role of the Southern Ocean in ventilating the
deep ocean, affecting CO2 control of global temperature, and (2) the role of subsurface
ocean warming in ice shelf melt, affecting ice sheet disintegration and sea level rise.

5.1 Paleoclimate context

Major glacial-interglacial climate oscillations are spurred by periodic variation of sea-
sonal and geographical insolation (Hays et al., 1976). Insolation anomalies are caused
by slow changes of the eccentricity of Earths orbit, tilt of Earths spin axis, and preces-
sion of the equinoxes, thus the day of year at which Earth is closest to the Sun, with
dominant periodicities near 100 000, 40 000 and 20 000 years (Berger, 1978). These
periods emerge in long climate records, yet a large fraction of climate variability at
any site is stochastic (Wunsch, 2004; Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). Such behavior is
expected for a weakly-forced system characterized by amplifying feedbacks, complex
dynamics, and multiple sources of inertia with a range of time scales.

Large glacial-interglacial climate change and stochastic variability are a result of
two strong amplifying feedbacks, surface albedo and atmospheric CO2. Orbit-induced
insolation anomalies, per se, cause a climate forcing, i.e., an Earth energy imbalance,
only of order 0.1 W m2, but the persistent regional insolation anomalies spur changes
of ice sheet size and GHGs. The albedo and GHG changes arise as slow climate
feedbacks, but they are the forcings that maintain a quasi-equilibrium climate state
nearly in global radiative balance. Glacial-interglacial albedo and greenhouse forcings
are each  3 W m2 (Fig. 24e, f)1. These forcings fully account for glacial-interglacial
global temperature change with a climate sensitivity 0.51 C per W m2 (Hansen et al.,
2008; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2010; Palaeosens, 2012).

The insolation anomaly peaking at 129.5 ky b2k (Fig. 24a) succeeded in removing
ice sheets from North America and Eurasia and in driving atmospheric CO2 up to
1Other parts of Fig. 24 are discussed later, but they are most informative if aligned together.
In interpreting Fig. 24, note that long-lived greenhouse gas amounts in ice cores have global
relevance, but ice core temperatures are local to Greenland and Antarctica. Also, because our
analysis does not depend on absolute temperature, we do not need to convert the temperature
proxy, 18O, into an estimated absolute temperature. We include CH4 and N2O in the total GHG
climate forcing, but we do not discuss the reasons for CH4 and N2O variability (see Schilt et al.,
2010), because CO2 provides  80 % of the GHG forcing.

 285 ppm, as discussed below. However, smaller climate oscillations within the last
glacial cycle are also instructive about ice feedbacks. Some of these oscillations are
related to weak insolation anomalies and all are affected by predominately amplifying
climate feedbacks.
Insolation anomalies peaking at 107 and 86 ky b2k (Fig. 24a) led to  40 m sea level
rises at rates exceeding 1 m century1 (Stirling et al., 1998; Cutler et al., 2003) in early
MIS 5c and 5a (Fig. 24f), but CO2 did not rise above 250 ppm and interglacial status
was not achieved. CO2 then continued on a 100 ky decline until  18 ky b2k. Sea level
continued its long decline, in concert with CO2, reaching a minimum at least 120 m
below todays sea level (Peltier and Fairbanks, 2006; Lambeck et al., 2014).

Progress achieved by the paleoclimate and oceanographic research communities
allows interpretation of the role of the Southern Ocean in the tight relationship between
CO2 and temperature, as well as discussion of the role of subsurface ocean warming
in sea level rise. Both topics are needed to interpret end-Eemian climate change and
ongoing climate change.

5.2 Southern Ocean and atmospheric CO2

Reduced atmospheric CO2 in glacial times, at least in substantial part, results from in-
creased stratification of the Southern Ocean that reduces ventilation of the deep ocean
(Toggweiler, 1999; Anderson et al., 2009; Skinner et al., 2010; Tschumi et al., 2011;
Burke and Robinson, 2012; Schmitt et al., 2012; Marcott et al., 2014). Today the aver-
age age of deep water, i.e., the time since it left the ocean surface, is  1000 years
(DeVries and Primeau, 2011), but it was more than twice that old during the last glacial
maximum (Skinner et al., 2010). The Southern Ocean dominates exchange between
the deep ocean and atmosphere because  80 % of deep water resurfaces in the
Southern Ocean (Lumpkin and Speer, 2007), as westerly circumpolar winds and sur-
face flow draw up deep water (Talley, 2013).

Mechanisms causing more rapid deep ocean ventilation during interglacials include
warmer Antarctic climate that increases heat flux into the ocean and buoyancy mixing

that supports upwelling (Watson and Garabato, 2006), poleward shift of the westerlies
(Toggweiler et al., 2006), and reduced sea ice (Keeling and Stephens, 2001). Fischer et
al. (2010) question whether the latitudinal shift of westerlies is an important contributor;
however, the basic point is the empirical fact that a warmer interglacial Southern Ocean
produces faster ventilation of the deep ocean via a combination of mechanisms.

Poor ocean ventilation in glacial periods allows carbon to be sequestered via the
biological pump, the rain of organic matter from the surface ocean that affects burial
of calcium carbonate in sediments (Sigman and Boyle, 2000). Dust-borne iron fertiliza-
tion of the biological pump (Martin and Fitzwater, 1988) contributes to millennial and
full glacial CO2 drawdown (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014). In concert, global cooling
drives the simple solubility pump, as the temperature dependence of CO2 solubil-
ity increases dissolved inorganic carbon (Raven and Falkowski, 1999). The increased
acidity of deep water makes it more corrosive to carbonate sediments, thus increasing
ocean alkalinity and further lowering atmospheric CO2 (Boyle, 1988).

Much remains to be learned about glacial-interglacial carbon cycle mechanisms.
Carbon isotopes indicate that increased deep ocean ventilation during deglaciation
from the last ice age caused a 3035 ppm CO2 increase within 2000 years (Schmitt et
al., 2012; Tschumi et al., 2011). However, AMOC changes are associated with at least
two rapid CO2 increases of about 10 ppm, as revealed by a high resolution West Antarc-
tic ice core (Marcott et al., 2014). Another indication of possible Atlantic involvement
in the carbon cycle is the change of the North Atlantics Western Boundary Undercur-
rent during the transition to full glacial conditions at  70 ky b2k when CO2 dropped
below 200 ppm (Fig. 24); the flow became stronger in the upper 2 km while the deeper
circulation weakened (Thornalley et al., 2013). No doubt the terrestrial biosphere also
contributes to atmospheric CO2 change (Archer et al., 2000; Sigman and Boyle, 2000;
Kohler et al., 2005; Menviel et al., 2012; Fischer et al., 2015). Nevertheless, it is rea-
sonably clear that sequestration of CO2 in the glacial ocean is the largest cause of
glacial-interglacial CO2 change, and ocean ventilation occurs mainly via the Southern
Ocean.

Southern Ocean ventilation, as the dominant cause of atmospheric CO2 change,
helps explain temperature-CO2 leads and lags. Temperature and CO2 rises are almost
congruent at ice age terminations (Masson-Delmotte, 2010; Pedro et al., 2012; Par-
renin et al., 2013). Southern Ocean temperature is expected to lead, spurring deep
ocean ventilation and atmospheric CO2 increase, with global temperature following.
Termination I is dated best and Shakun et al. (2012) have reconstructed global temper-
ature then, finding evidence for this expected order of events.

Correlation of 18O and CO2 over the past 140 ky (Fig. 24c) is 84.4 % with CO2 lag-
ging by 760 years. For the period 10020 ky b2k, which excludes the two terminations,
the correlation is 77.5 % with CO2 lagging by 1040 years. Briefer lag for the longer pe-
riod and longer lag during glacial inception are consistent with the rapid deep ocean
ventilation that occurs at terminations.

5.3 CO2 as climate control knob

CO2 is the principal determinant of Earths climate state, the control knob that sets
global mean temperature (Lacis et al., 2010, 2013). The degree of control is shown
by comparison of CO2 amount with Antarctic temperature for the past 800 000 years
(Fig. 25a). Control should be even tighter for global temperature than for Antarctic
temperature, because of regional anomalies such as Antarctic temperature overshoot
at terminations (Masson-Delmotte, 2006, 2010), but global data are not available.2

2The tight fit of CO2 and Antarctic temperature (Fig. 25a) implies an equilibrium Antarctic
sensitivity 20 C for 2 CO2 (4 W m2) forcing (200  300 ppm forcing is  2.3 W m2, Table 1
of Hansen et al., 2000), thus 10 C global climate sensitivity (Antarctic temperature change is
 twice global change) with CO2 taken as the ultimate control knob, i.e., if snow/ice area and
other GHGs are taken to be slaves to CO2-driven climate change. This implies a conventional
climate sensitivity of 4 C for 2 CO2, as GHG and albedo forcings are similar for glacial-to-
interglacial climate change and non-CO2 GHGs account for  20 % of the GHG forcing. The
inferred sensitivity is reduced to 2.53 C for 2 CO2 if, as some studies suggest, global mean

The CO2 dial must be turned to  260 ppm to achieve a Holocene-level interglacial.
CO2  250 ppm was sufficient for quasi-interglacials in the period 800450 ky b2k, with
sea level 1025 m lower than in the Holocene (Fig. S18 of Hansen et al., 2008). In-
terglacials with CO2  280 ppm, i.e., the Eemian and Holsteinian ( 400 ky b2k), were
warmer than the Holocene and had sea level at least several meters higher than today.
CO2 and albedo change are closely congruent over the last 800 000 years (Fig. S18
of Hansen et al., 2008). GHG and albedo forcings, which are both amplifying feedbacks
that boost each other, are each of amplitude  3 W m2. So why do we say that CO2 is
the control knob?
First, CO2, in addition to being a slow climate feedback, changes independently of
climate. Natural CO2 change includes increase to  1000 ppm about 50 million years
ago (Zachos et al., 2001) as a result of plate tectonics, specifically volcanic emissions
associated with movement of the Indian plate across the Tethys Ocean and collision
with Asia (Kent and Muttoni, 2008). Humankind, mainly by burning fossil fuels, also
moves the CO2 control knob.

Second, CO2 is more recalcitrant than snow and ice, i.e., its response time is longer.
CO2 inserted into the climate system, by humans or plate tectonics, remains in the cli-
mate system of order 100 000 years before full removal by weathering (Archer, 2005).
Even CO2 exchange between the atmosphere (where it affects climate) and ocean has
a lag of the order a millennium (Fig. 24). In contrast, correlations of paleo tempera-
tures and sea level show that lag of sea level change behind temperature is of order a
century, not a millennium (Grant et al., 2012).

We suggest that limitations on the speed of ice volume (thus sea level) changes in
the paleo record are more a consequence of the pace of orbital changes and CO2
changes, as opposed to being a result of lethargic ice physics. Fast changes of CO2
have been identified, e.g., an increase of  10 ppm in about a century at  39.6 ky b2k
(Ahn et al., 2012) and three increases of 1015 ppm each within 12 centuries during

glacial-interglacial temperature change is only about one-third of the Antarctic temperature
change (Palaeosens, 2012; Hansen et al., 2013b).

the deglaciation following the last ice age (Marcott et al., 2014), but the magnitude
of these CO2 increases is not sufficient to provide a good empirical test of ice sheet
sensitivity to the CO2 forcing.

Supremacy of SMOC, the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation, in af-
fecting the CO2 control knob and thus glacial-interglacial change is contrary to the idea
that AMOC is a prime driver that flips global climate between quasi-stable glacial and
interglacial states, yet AMOC retains a significant role. AMOC can affect CO2 via the
volume and residence time of NADW, but its largest effect is probably via its impact
on the Southern Ocean. When AMOC is not shut down it cools the Southern Hemi-
sphere, transferring heat from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere at a rate  1
petawatt, which is  4 W m2 averaged over a hemisphere (Crowley, 1992). However,
the Southern Ocean slowly warms when AMOC shuts (or slows) down; the response
time is of the order of 1000 years because of the Southern Oceans large thermal in-
ertia (Stocker and Johnson, 2003). These mechanisms largely account for the nature
of the bipolar seesaw (Broecker, 1998; Stocker, 1998; Stenni et al., 2011; Landais et
al., 2015), including the lag between AMOC slowdown and Antarctic warming.

5.4 DansgaardOeschger events and subsurface ocean warming

The magnitude and rapidity of Greenland climate change during DansgaardOeschger
events would deter prediction of human-made climate effects, if DO events remained
a mystery. Instead, however, enough is now understood about DO events that they
provide insight related to the vulnerability of ice shelves and ice sheets, including the
role of subsurface ocean warming.

Broecker (2000) inferred from the rapidity of DO warmings that a reduction of sea
ice cover was probably involved. Li et al. (2005, 2010) modeling showed that removal of
Nordic Seas ice cover is needed to yield the magnitude of observed Greenland warm-
ing. The spatial gradient of DO warming, with smaller warming in northwest Green-
land, agrees with that picture (Guillevic et al., 2013; Buizert et al., 2014). Such sea
ice change is consistent with changes in deuterium excess in Greenland ice cores at

DO transitions, which indicate shifts of Greenland moisture source regions (Masson-
Delmotte et al., 2005; Jouzel et al., 2007).

Fluckiger et al. (2006), Alvarez-Solas et al. (2010, 2011, 2013) and Marcott et
al. (2011) noted modern and paleo data that point to ocean-ice shelf interaction as
key to the ice discharge of accompanying Heinrich events, and they used a range of
models to support this interpretation and overturn earlier suggestions of a central role
for ice sheets via binge-purge oscillations (MacAyeal, 1993) or outburst flooding from
subglacial reservoirs (Alley et al., 2006). Shaffer et al. (2004) and Petersen et al. (2013)
conclude that subsurface ocean warming in the North Atlantic takes place during the
stadial (cold) phase of all DO events, and eventually this subsurface warming leads
to ice shelf collapse or retreat, ice rafting, sea level rise, and sea ice changes. Ras-
mussen et al. (2003) examined ocean cores from the southeast Labrador Sea and
found that for all 11 Heinrich events . . . the icy surface water was overlying a relatively
warm, poorly ventilated and nutrient rich intermediate water mass to a water depth of
at least 1251 m. Collapse of a Greenland ice shelf fronting the Jakoshavn ice stream
during the Younger Dryas cold event has been documented (Rinterknecht et al., 2014),
apparently due to subsurface warming beneath the ice shelf leading to rapid discharge
of icebergs.

Some DO details are uncertain, e.g., the relation between changing sea ice cover
and changing location of deep water formation (Rahmstorf, 1994) and whether an ice
shelf between Greenland and Iceland contributed to the sea ice variability (Petersen
et al., 2013). However, ocean-ice interactions emerge as key mechanisms, spurred by
subsurface ocean warming, as ocean stratification slows but does not stop northward
heat transport by AMOC.

We consider a specific DO event for the sake of discussing mechanisms. DO 22
cold phase, labeled C22 in ocean cores and coinciding with Heinrich H8 (Fig. 24),
occurred as Northern Hemisphere insolation was rising (Fig. 24a). The North Atlantic
surface was cooled by rapid ice discharge; sea level rose more than 40 m, a rate ex-
ceeding 1.6 m per century (Cutler et al., 2003). Ice discharge kept the North Atlantic

highly stratified, slowing AMOC. Antarctic warming from a slowed AMOC increases
almost linearly with the length of the DO cold phase (Fig. 3, EPICA Community Mem-
bers, 2006; Fig. 6, Capron et al., 2010) because of the Southern Oceans large heat
capacity (Stocker and Johnson, 2003). Antarctic warming, aided by the 2500 year DO
22 event, spurred SMOC enough to raise atmospheric CO2 40 ppm (Fig. 24c).

As the Antarctic warmed, ocean heat transport to the North Atlantic would have in-
creased, with most heat carried at depths below the surface layer. When the North At-
lantic became warm enough at depth, stratification of cold fresh surface water eventu-
ally could not be maintained. The warming breakthrough may have included change of
NADW formation location (Rahmstorf, 1994) or just large movement of the polar front.
Surface warming east of Greenland removed most sea ice and Greenland warmed
 10 C (Capron et al., 2010). As the warm phase of DO 21 began, AMOC was pump-
ing heat from the Antarctic into the Nordic seas and Earth must have been slightly out
of energy balance, cooling to space, so both Antarctica and Greenland slowly cooled.
Once the North Atlantic had cooled enough, sea formed east of Greenland again, ice
sheets and ice shelves grew, sea level fell, and the polar front moved southward.
Sea level rise associated with DO events covers a wide range. Sea level increases
as large as  40 m were associated with large insolation forcings at 107 and 86 ky
b2k (Fig. 24). However, rapid sea level change occurred even when forcing was weak.
Roche et al. (2004) conclude from analyses of 18O that H4, at a time of little insolation
forcing ( 40 ky b2k, Fig. 24), produced 1.9 1.1 m sea level rise over 250 150 years.
Sea level rise as great as 1015 m occurred in conjunction with some other DO events
during 6530 ky b2k (Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Yokoyama et al., 2001; Chappell,
2002).

Questions about possible DO periodicity and external forcing were raised by a
seeming 1470 year periodicity (Schulz, 2002). However, improved dating indicates that
such periodicity is an artifact of ice core chronologies and not statistically significant
(Ditlevsen et al., 2007) and inspection of Fig. 24b reveals a broad range of time scales.
Instead, the data imply a climate system that responds sensitively to even weak forc-

ings and stochastic variability, both of which can spur amplifying feedbacks with a range
of characteristic response times.

Two conclusions are especially germane. First, subsurface ocean warming is an ef-
fective mechanism for destabilizing ice shelves and thus the ice sheets buttressed by
the ice shelves. Second, large rapid sea level rise can occur as a result of melting ice
shelves.

However, ice shelves probably were more extensive during glacial times. So are
todays ice sheets much more stable? The need to understand ice sheet vulnerability
focuses attention on end-Eemian events, when ice sheets were comparable in size to
todays ice sheets.

5.5 End-Eemian climate and sea level change
Termination II, ushering in the Eemian, was spurred by a late spring 60 N insolation
anomaly peaking at +45 W m2 at 129.5 ky b2k (Fig. 24a), the largest anomaly in at
least the past 425 ky (Fig. 3, Hansen et al., 2007b). CO2 and albedo forcings were
mutually reinforcing. CO2 began to rise before Antarctic 18O, as deglaciation and
warming began in the Northern Hemisphere. Most of the total CO2 rise was presumably
from deep ocean ventilation in the Southern Ocean, aided by meltwater that slowed the
AMOC and thus helped to warm the Southern Ocean.

The northern insolation anomaly fell rapidly, becoming negative at 123.8 ky b2k
(Fig. 24a). Northern Hemisphere ice sheets must have increased intermittently while
Southern Hemisphere ice was still declining, consistent with minor, growing ice rafting
events C27, C27a, C27b and C26 and a sea level minimum during 125121 ky b2k
(Sec 2.1). High Eemian climate variability in the Antarctic (Pol et al., 2014) was likely a
result of the see-saw relation with North Atlantic events.
CO2 (Fig. 24c) remained at  270 ppm for almost 15 ky as the positive insolation
anomaly on the Southern Ocean (Fig. 24a) kept the deep ocean ventilated. Sea level
in the Red Sea analysis (Grant et al., 2012) shown in Fig. 24f seems to be in decline
through the Eemian, but that must be a combination of dating and sea level error, as

numerous sea level analyses cited in Sect. 2.1 and others (e.g., Chen at al., 1991;
Stirling et al., 1998; Cutler et al., 2003), indicate high sea level throughout the Eemian
and allow a possible late-Eemian maximum. Chen et al. (1991), using a U-series dating
with 2 uncertainty 1.5 ky, found that the Eemian sea level high stand began between
132 and 129 ky b2k, lasted for 12 ky, and was followed by rapid sea level fall.

We assume that C26, the sharp cooling at 116.72 ky b2k in the NGRIP ice on the
AICC2012 time scale, marks the end of fully interglacial Eemian conditions, described
as 5e sensu stricto by Bauch and Erlenkeuser (2008). 18O in Antarctica was ap-
proaching a relative minimum (46.7 per mil at EDML, see Fig. S19 for detail) and
CO2 was slowly declining at 263 ppm. In the next 300 years 18O increased to 45.2
and CO2 increased by 13 ppm with lag  1500 years, which we interpret as see-saw
warming of the Southern Ocean in response to the C26-induced AMOC slowdown and
resulting increased SMOC ventilation of CO2.

Freshwater causing the C26 AMOC shutdown could not have been Greenland sur-
face melt. Greenland was already 2000 years into a long cooling trend and the northern
insolation anomaly was in the deepest minimum of the last 150 ky (Fig. 24a). Instead
C26 was one event in a series, preceded by C27b and followed by C25, each a re-
sult of subsurface North Atlantic warming that melted ice shelves, causing ice sheets
to discharge ice. Chapman and Shackleton (1999) did not find IRD from C26 in the
mid-Atlantic, but Carlson et al. (2008) found a sharp increase in sediments near the
southern tip of Greenland that they identified with C26.

We suggest that the Southern Hemisphere was the source for brief late-Eemian
sea level rise. The positive warm-season insolation anomaly on the Southern Ocean
and AMOC slowdown due to C26 added to Southern Ocean heat, causing ice shelf
melt, ice sheet discharge, and sea level rise. Rapid Antarctica ice loss would cool the
Southern Ocean and increase sea ice cover, which may have left telltale evidence in
ice cores. Indeed, Masson-Delmotte et al. (2011) suggest that abrupt changes of 18O
in the EDML and TALDICE ice cores (those most proximal to the coast) indicate a
change in moisture origin, likely due to increased sea ice. Further analysis of Antarctic

data for the late Eemian might help pinpoint the melting and help assess vulnerability
of Antarctic ice sheets to ocean warming, but this likely will require higher resolution
models with more realistic sea ice distribution and seasonal change than our present
model produces.
Terrestrial records in Northern Europe reveal rapid end-Eemian cooling. Sirocko et
al. (2005) find cooling of 3 C in summer and 510 C in winter in southern Germany,
annual layering in a dry Eifel maar lake revealing a 468 year period of aridity, dust
storms, bushfires, and a decline of thermophilous trees. Similar cooling is found at
other German sites and La Grande Pile in France (Kuhl and Litt, 2003). Authors in
both cases interpret the changes as due to a southward shift of the polar front in the
North Atlantic corresponding to C26. Cooling of this magnitude in northern Europe
and increased aridity are found by Brayshaw et al. (2009) and Jackson et al. (2015) in
simulations with high resolution climate models forced by AMOC shutdown.

While reiterating dating uncertainties, we note that the cool period with reduced
NADW formation identified in recent high resolution ocean core studies for Eirik Drift
site MD03-2664 (Fig. 3) near Greenland (Irvali et al., 2012; Galaasen et al., 2014) at
 117 ky b2k has length similar to the 468 year cold stormy period found in a German
lake core (Sirocko et al., 2005). The Eirik core data show a brief return to near-Eemian
conditions and then a slow decline, similar to the oscillation in the NGRIP ice core at
116.72 ky b2k on the AICC2012 time scale.

The principal site of NADW formation may have moved from the GIN Seas to just
south of Greenland at end of the Eemian. Southward shift of NADW formation and the
polar front is consistent with the sudden, large end-Eemian cooling in the North Atlantic
and northern Europe, while cooling in Southern European was delayed by a few mil-
lennia (Brauer et al., 2007). Thus end-Eemian mid-latitude climate was characterized
by an increased zonal temperature gradient, an important ingredient for strengthening
storms.

6 Impact of ice melt on storms

We can draw some conclusions about the effect of ice melt on winds and severe
weather, despite limitations of our current climate model. Principal model limitations
are its coarse resolution and unrealistic location of Northern Hemisphere deep water
formation, this latter problem being likely related to the models excessive Northern
Hemisphere sea ice cover.

Despite these caveats, we have shown that the model realistically simulates zonal
changes of sea level pressure in response to climate forcings. Specifically, the model
yields a realistic trend to the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in
response to decrease of stratospheric ozone and increase of other GHGs (Fig. S17).
The modeled response of atmospheric pressure to the cooling effect of ice melt
is large scale, tending to be of a zonal nature that should be handled by our model
resolution. Freshwater injection onto the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans causes
increase of sea level pressure at middle latitudes and decrease at polar latitudes
(Figs. 13, S11). These pressure changes have implications for the strength of pre-
vailing winds and for severe weather.

The robust increase of high pressure in the North Atlantic strengthens prevailing
northeasterly winds blowing onto the Bahamas (Fig. 13). The Eemian-age chevron
beach structures with consistent southwesterly direction throughout windward shores
in the Bahamas (Sect. 2.2), with wave runup deposits at elevations as much as 20
40 m above todays sea level and reaching as far as a few kilometers inland, must
have been formed by massive storms in the direction of the prevailing winds. Consis-
tent increase of wind speed in the appropriate direction would contribute to creation of
long wavelength, deep ocean waves that can scour the ocean floor as they reach the
shallow near-shore region. The most extreme events probably required the combined
effect of these increased prevailing winds and tropical storms, the latter nurtured by
the unusually warm tropical sea surface temperatures in the late Eemian and guided
by the strong prevailing winds. On theoretical grounds, it is known that the higher low

latitude sea surface temperatures of the late Eemian (Cortijo et al., 1999) would fa-
vor more powerful tropical storms (Emanuel, 1987). The zonal temperature gradient,
warmer tropics and cooler high latitudes, was enhanced by low obliquity of Earths spin
axis in the late Eemian. Empirical evidence for intense Eemian storms includes stand-
ing forests of 810 m trees that were rapidly buried in shelf sand and preserved on
Bermuda at elevations several meters above sea level (Hearty and Olson, 2011), as
well as other evidence discussed in Sect. 2.2. The late Eemian is typically associated
with a massive flux of oolitic shelf sediments mobilized in the offshore shelf environ-
ment and further transported by intense winds into enormous land-based dunes that
dominate a majority of modern landscapes of the Bahamas archipelago (Hearty and
Neumann, 2001).

Shutdown or substantial slowdown of the AMOC, besides possibly contributing to
extreme end-Eemian events, will cause a more general increase of severe weather.
This is shown by the change of zonal mean temperature and eddy kinetic energy in
our simulations with and without ice melt (Fig. 26). Without ice melt, surface warm-
ing is largest in the Arctic (Fig. 26, left), resulting in a decrease of lower tropospheric
eddy energy. However, the surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower
tropospheric temperature gradients, and in stark contrast to the case without ice melt,
there is a large increase of mid-latitude eddy energy throughout the midlatitude tropo-
sphere. The increase of zonal-mean midlatitude baroclinicity that we find (Fig. 26) is
in agreement with the localized, N. Atlantic-centered increases in baroclinicity found in
the higher resolution simulations of Jackson et al. (2015) and Brayshaw et al. (2009).
Increased baroclinicity produced by a stronger temperature gradient provides energy
for more severe weather events. Many of the most memorable and devastating storms
in eastern North America and western Europe, popularly known as superstorms, have
been winter cyclonic storms, though sometimes occurring in late fall or early spring,
that generate near-hurricane force winds and often large amounts of snowfall (Chapter
11, Hansen, 2009). Continued warming of low latitude oceans in coming decades will
provide more water vapor to strengthen such storms. If this tropical warming is com-

bined with a cooler North Atlantic Ocean from AMOC slowdown and an increase in
midlatitude eddy energy (Fig. 26), we can anticipate more severe baroclinic storms.
Increased high pressure due to cooler high latitude ocean (Fig. 13) can make block-
ing situations more extreme, with a steeper pressure gradient between the storms low
pressure center and the blocking high, thus driving stronger North Atlantic storms.

Large freshwater injection on the North Atlantic Ocean has a different impact on
winds than freshwater injection on the Southern Ocean (Fig. 13). In the Southern
Ocean the increased meridional temperature gradient increases the strength of the
westerlies in all seasons at all longitudes. In the North Atlantic Ocean the increase of
sea level pressure in the winter slows the westerlies (Fig. 13). Thus instead of a strong
zonal wind that keeps cold polar air locked in the Arctic, there is a tendency for more
cold air outbreaks to middle latitudes.

7 Modern data

7.1 Southern Ocean

The Southern Ocean, as the gateway to the global deep ocean, has exerted a powerful
control over glacial/interglacial climate. However, the Southern Oceans control over the
Antarctic ice sheet, and thus global sea level, will be of greater concern to humanity.

Our model, due to moderately excessive mixing, may be less sensitive to freshwater
forcing than the real world. Yet the model (Fig. 27a) indicates that a slowing of Antarctic
Bottom Water Formation should already be underway, a conclusion consistent with
transient tracer observations in the Weddell Sea by Huhn et al. (2013), which reveal
a 1521 % reduction in the ventilation of Weddell Sea Bottom Water and Weddell Sea
Deep Water over the period 19842008.

The Southern Ocean has significant control on release of ocean heat to space. In
an extreme case, polynyas form in the dead of Antarctic winter, as upwelling warm
water melts the sea ice and raises the air temperature by tens of degrees, increasing

thermal radiation to space, thus serving as a valve that releases ocean heat. Today,
as surface meltwater stabilizes the vertical water column, that valve is being partially
closed. de Lavergne et al. (2014) relate the absence of large open ocean polynyas in
recent decades to surface freshening.

Release of heat to the atmosphere and space, which occurs without the need for
large open ocean polynyas, is slowed by increasing sea ice cover in response to in-
creasing ice shelf melt (Bintanja et al., 2013). Schmidtko et al. (2014) and Roemmich
et al. (2015) document changes in the Southern Ocean in recent decades, especially
warming of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which they and others (Jacobs et al.,
2011; Rignot et al., 2013) note is the likely cause of increased ice shelf melt. Observa-
tions of ocean surface freshening and freshening of the water column (Rintoul, 2007;
Jacobs and Giulivi, 2010) and deep ocean warming (Johnson et al., 2007; Purkey and
Johnson, 2013) leave little doubt that these processes are occurring.

Loss of ice shelves that buttress the ice sheets potentially can lead to large sea level
rise (Mercer, 1978). The ocean depths with largest warming in response to surface
freshening (Fig. 16) encompass ice shelf grounding lines that exert the strongest re-
straining force (Jenkins and Doake, 1991). The impact of warming CDW varies among
ice shelves because of unique geometries and proximity to the CDW current, but even-
tually a warming ocean will likely affect them all. As ice shelves weaken and ice sheet
discharge increases the process is self-amplifying via the increasing freshwater dis-
charge.

Weber et al. (2014) used ocean cores near Antarctica to study the deglacial evolu-
tion of the Antarctic ice sheet following the last glacial maximum. They identified eight
episodes of large iceberg flux, with the largest flux occurring  14 600 years ago, pro-
viding evidence of an Antarctic contribution to Meltwater Pulse 1A, when sea level rose
an average of 35 m century1 for a few centuries (Fairbanks, 1989). Ice sheets today
may not have as much vulnerable ice as they had during the ice age. On the other
hand, CO2 and the global climate forcing are increasing much more rapidly today, and
heat is being pumped into the ocean at a high rate via the resulting positive (incoming)

Ocean surface cooling near Antarctica is emerging now (Fig. 28) and is large by mid-
century (Fig. 20) in our simulations. The modeled sea ice increase is delayed relative to
observations (Fig. 27b) for reasons noted below. However, freshwater effects already
dominate over direct effects of O3 and other GHGs. D. Thompson et al. (2011) sug-
gested that O3 depletion may account for Antarctic sea ice growth, but Sigmond and
Fyfe (2014) found that all CMIP5 models yield decreasing sea ice in response to ob-
served changes of O3 and other GHGs. Ferreira et al. (2015) show that O3 depletion
yields a short time scale sea ice increase that is soon overtaken by warming and sea
ice decrease with realistic GHG forcing. We conclude that these models are missing
the dominant driver of change on the Southern Ocean: freshwater input.

Delay of our modeled sea ice increase relative to observations is probably related
to difficulty in maintaining vertical stratification (Fig. S18), which in turn is a result of
excess small scale mixing from a large background diapycnal diffusivity (0.3 cm2 s1)
used to damp numerical noise, and the noise itself. Also sea ice increase occurred
earlier in our experiments with freshwater spread over a broad area rather than being
placed only in coastal gridboxes. In the real world half of the freshwater is calving (ice-
bergs) that float some distance before melting, which may increase the effectiveness
of the freshwater flux.

Depoorter et al. (2012) show that the proportion of calving varies strongly with lo-
cation (see their Fig. 1). The Weddell and Ross Sea regions have large freshwater
flux that is mainly icebergs. In contrast, the large Amundsen- Bellingshausen fresh-
water flux is mainly basal melt. This distinctive spatial variation may help account for
observed sea ice increasing in the Weddell and Ross Seas, while decreasing in the
Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. Note also that the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea
sectors are respectively the regions where the EDML and TALDICE Antarctic ice cores

are suggestive of expanding sea ice (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2011) at end-Eemian
time.

Observations and our model concur in showing a global warming hole near the
southern tip of Greenland. Drijfhout et al. (2012) find this feature in most models and
conclude that it is a precursor of a weakening AMOC. Freshwater injection in our
model makes this feature stronger. We note that this feature creates a blocking situa-
tion (Fig. 13) that may have consequences such as directing winter cold air outbreaks
southward in Eastern North America. This and possible influence on weather patterns
in late spring that initiate melt season conditions should be investigated with models
that include the most realistic distribution of Greenland freshwater input (e.g., Fig. 1 of
Velicogna et al., 2014) as well as melt from ice shelves and small ice caps.

7.3 Ice sheet mass loss and sea level rise

The fundamental question we raise is whether ice sheet melt in response to rapid
global warming will be nonlinear and better characterized by a doubling time for its rate
of change or whether more linear processes dominate. Hansen (2005, 2007) argued on
heuristic grounds that ice sheet disintegration is likely to be nonlinear if climate forcings
continue to grow, and that sea level rise of several meters is possible on a time scale
of the order of a century. Given current ice sheet melt rates, a 20 year doubling rate
produces multi-meter sea level rise in a century, while 10 and 40 year doubling times
require 50 and 200 years, respectively.

The IPCC (2013) report increased estimates of sea level rise compared to prior IPCC
reports, but scenarios they discuss are close to linear responses to the assumed rising
climate forcing. The most extreme climate forcing (RCP8.5, 936 ppm CO2 in 2100 and
GHG forcing 8.5 W m2) is estimated to produce 0.74 m sea level rise in 2100 relative to
the 19862005 mean sea level, with the likely range of uncertainty 0.520.98 m. IPCC
(2013) also discusses semi-empirical estimates of sea level rise, which yield  0.7
1.5 m for the RCP8.5 scenario, but preference is given to the model-based estimate of
0.520.98 m.

Empirical analyses are needed if we doubt the realism of ice sheet models, but semi-
empirical analyses lumping multiple processes together may yield a result that is too
linear. Sea level rises as a warming ocean expands, as water storage on continents
changes (e.g., in aquifers and behind dams), and as glaciers, small ice caps, and the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt. We must isolate the ice sheet contribution,
because only the ice sheets threaten multi-meter sea level rise.

Hay et al. (2015) reanalyzed tide-gauge data for 19011990 in a probabilistic frame-
work, including isostatic adjustment at each station, finding global sea level rise
1.2 0.2 mm yr1. Prior tide gauge analyses of 1.61.9 mm yr1 were inconsistent with
estimates for each process, which did not add up to such a large value (IPCC, 2013).
The reduced 20th century sea level rise alters perceptions of near-linear sea level rise
(Fig. 13.3, IPCC, 2013). For example, Fig. 29 compares satellite altimetry data for 1993-
2015 with 20th century sea level change, the latter obtained by multiplying a tide gauge
analysis (Church and White, 2011) by the factor (0.78) required to yield sea level rise
1.2 mm yr1 for 19011990. Different tide gauge analyses could alter the shape of this
curve, but the trend toward earlier times must be toward zero due to near-constancy of
millennial sea level (IPCC, 2013).

Figure 29 reveals an accelerating sea level rise, but it includes the effect of all
processes affecting sea level and thus may understate the growth rate for ice sheet
melt. Recent analysis of satellite gravity measurements (Velicogna et al., 2014) finds
Greenlands mass loss in 20032013 to be 280 58 Gt yr1,3 with mass loss accel-
erating by 25.4 1.2 Gt yr2, and Antarctic mass loss 67 44 Gt yr1 accelerating by
11 4 Gt yr2 (Fig. S20). Their analysis, which is the source of the quantitative mass
3For comparison, our assumed freshwater injection of 360 Gt yr1 in 2011 with 10 year
doubling yields an average mass loss 292 Gt yr1 for 20032013. Further, Velicogna et
al. (2014) find an ice mass loss of 74 7 Gt yr1 from nearby Canadian glaciers and ice
caps with acceleration 10 2 Gt yr2, and there is an unknown freshwater input from melt-
ing ice shelves. Thus our assumed Northern Hemisphere meltwater was conservative.

changes in the remainder of this section, is especially useful because it breaks down
the mass changes on Greenland and Antarctica into several regions.

Reliability of the inferred mass loss in 20032013 is supported by comparison to
surface mass balance studies in regions with little contribution from ice dynamics
(Velicogna et al., 2014). Mass loss accelerations over 19922011 obtained via the
mass budget method (Rignot et al., 2011) for Greenland (21.9 1 Gt yr2) and Antarc-
tica (14.5 2 Gt yr2) are similar to results from gravity analysis for 20032013. A third
approach, based on satellite radar altimetry, is consistent with the other two for mass
loss from Greenland and West Antarctica (Shepherd et al., 2012), including the Amund-
sen Sea sector, which is the dominant contributor to Antarctic ice mass loss (Sutterley
et al., 2014). Differences among techniques exist in East Antarctica, but mass changes
there are small (Shepherd et al., 2012).

Mass loss acceleration for Greenland implies a doubling time of order 10 years, but
this high rate may not continue. Greenland mass loss in 20032013 was affected by a
tendency in 20072012 for summer high pressure over Greenland that contributed to
melt acceleration (Fettweis, 2013; Bellflamme et al., 2015), especially in 2012 (Hanna
et al., 2013). Extreme 2012 melt was associated an atmospheric river of warm moist
air (Neff et al., 2014), a rare meteorological situation not representative of near-term
expectations. Yet extreme events are a combination of slow climate change and in-
frequent weather patterns, and additional and more summer extreme events can be
anticipated if global warming continues (Hansen et al., 2012).

The Antarctic situation, in contrast, is more threatening than suggested by conti-
nental mass loss. Net mass loss combines mass loss via ice streams and regions
of net snow accumulation. Queen Maud Land is gaining 63 6 Gt yr1, accelerating
15 1 Gt yr2, but this mass gain may be temporary. Our simulations with increasing
freshwater input indicate that circum-Antarctic cooling and sea ice increase eventually
will limit precipitation reaching the continent.
Amundsen Sea glaciers are a gateway to West Antarctic ice with potential for several
meters of sea level. Mass loss of the Amundsen Sea sector was 116 6 Gt yr1 in

20032013, growing 13 2 Gt yr2 (Velicogna et al., 2014; Rignot et al., 2014; Sutterley
et al., 2014).
Totten glacier in East Antarctica fronts the Aurora Subglacial Basin, which has the po-
tential for  6.7 m of sea level (Greenbaum et al., 2015). Williams et al. (2011) find that
warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water is penetrating the continental shelf near Totten
beneath colder surface layers. Details of how warmer water reaches the ice shelf are
uncertain (Khazendar et al., 2013), but, as in West Antarctica, the inland sloping trough
connecting the ocean with the main ice shelf cavity (Greenbaum et al., 2015) makes
Totten glacier susceptible to unstable retreat (Goldberg et al., 2009). Cook glacier, fur-
ther east in East Antarctica, also rests on a submarine inland-sloping bed and fronts
ice equivalent to 34 m of sea level. The Velicogna et al. (2014) analysis of gravity data
for 20032013 finds the Totten sector of East Antarctica losing 17 4 Gt yr1, with the
loss accelerating by 4 1 Gt yr2, and the Victoria/Wilkes sector including Cook glacier
losing 16 5 Gt yr1, with a small deceleration (2 1 Gt yr2).

Ice mass losses from Greenland, West Antarctica and Totten/Aurora basin in East
Antarctica are growing nonlinearly with doubling times of order 10 years. Continued
exponential growth at that rate seems unlikely for Greenland, and reduced mass loss
in the past two years (Fig. S20) is consistent with a slower growth of the mass loss
rate for Greenland. However, if GHGs continue to grow, the amplifying feedbacks in the
Southern Ocean, including expanded sea ice and SMOC slowdown likely will continue
to grow and facilitate increasing Antarctic mass loss.

7.4 The Anthropocene

Full Screen / Esc

The Anthropocene (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000), the era in which humans have con-
tributed to global climate change, is usually assumed to have begun in the past few
centuries. Ruddiman (2003) suggested that it began earlier, with deforestation affect-
ing CO2 about 8000 years ago. Southern Ocean feedbacks considered in our present
paper are relevant to that discussion.

Ruddiman (2003) assumed that 40 ppm of human-made CO2 was needed to explain
a 20 ppm CO2 increase in the Holocene (Fig. 24c), because CO2 decreased  20 ppm,
on average, during several prior interglacials. Such a large human source should have
left an imprint on 13CO2 that is not observed in ice core CO2 (Elsig et al., 2009).
Ruddiman (2013) suggests that 13C was taken up in peat formation, but the required
peat formation would be large and no persuasive evidence has been presented to
support such a dominant role for peat in the glacial carbon cycle.

We suggest that Ruddiman overestimated the anthropogenic CO2 needed to prevent
decline of Antarctic temperature. The CO2 decline in interglacial periods is a climate
feedback: declining Southern Ocean temperature slows the ventilation of the deep
ocean, thus sequestering CO2. Avoidance of the cooling and CO2 decline requires
only human-made CO2 forcing large enough to counteract the weak natural forcing
trend, not the larger feedback-driven CO2 changes in prior interglacials, because, if the
natural forcings are counteracted, the feedback does not occur. The required human-
made contribution to atmospheric CO2 would seem to be at most  20 ppm, but less if
human-made CO2 increased deep ocean ventilation. The smaller requirement on the
human source and the low 13C content of deep-ocean CO2 make the Ruddiman hy-
pothesis more plausible, but recent carbon cycle models (Kleinen et al., 2015) have
been able to capture CO2 changes in the Holocene and earlier interglacials without an
anthropogenic source.

Even if the Anthropocene began millennia ago, a fundamentally different phase, a
Hyper-Anthropocene, was initiated by explosive 20th century growth of fossil fuel use.
Human-made climate forcings now overwhelm natural forcings. CO2, at 400 ppm in
2015, is off the scale in Fig. 24c. CO2 climate forcing is a reasonable approximation
of the net human forcing, because forcing by other GHGs tends to offset negative
human forcings, mainly aerosols (IPCC, 2013). Most of the forcing growth occurred in
the past several decades, and two-thirds of the 0.9 C global warming (since 1850) has
occurred since 1975 (update of Hansen et al., 2010, available at http://www.columbia.
edu/~mhs119/Temperature/).

Our analysis paints a different picture than IPCC (2013) for how this Hyper-
Anthropocene phase is likely to proceed if GHG emissions grow at a rate that con-
tinues to pump energy at a high rate into the ocean. We conclude that multi-meter sea
level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic con-
sequences of such large sea level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine
that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the
planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.

This image of our planet with accelerating meltwater includes growing climate chaos
and storminess, as meltwater causes cooling around Antarctica and in the North At-
lantic while the tropics and subtropics continue to warm. Rising seas and more powerful
storms together are especially threatening, providing strong incentive to phase down
CO2 emissions rapidly.

8 Summary implications

Conclusions

Humanity faces near certainty of eventual sea level rise of at least Eemian proportions,
59 m, if fossil fuel emissions continue on a business-as-usual course, e.g., IPCC sce-
nario A1B that has CO2  700 ppm in 2100 (Fig. S21). It is unlikely that coastal cities
or low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, European lowlands, and large portions of the
United States eastern coast and northeast China plains (Fig. S22) could be protected
against such large sea level rise.

Rapid large sea level rise may begin sooner than generally assumed. Amplifying
feedbacks, including slowdown of SMOC and cooling of the near-Antarctic ocean sur-
face with increasing sea ice, may spur nonlinear growth of Antarctic ice sheet mass
loss. Deep submarine valleys in West Antarctica and the Wilkes Basin of East Antarc-
tica, each with access to ice amounting to several meters of sea level, provide gateways
to the ocean. If the Southern Ocean forcing (subsurface warming) of the Antarctic ice
sheets continues to grow, it likely will become impossible to avoid sea level rise of
several meters, with the largest uncertainty being how rapidly it will occur.

The Greenland ice sheet does not have as much ice subject to rapid nonlinear dis-
integration, so the speed at which it adds to 21st century sea level rise may be limited.
However, even a slower Greenland ice sheet response is expected to be faster than
carbon cycle or ocean thermal recovery times. Therefore, if climate forcing continues
to grow rapidly, amplifying feedbacks will assure large eventual mass loss. Also with
present growth of freshwater injection from Greenland, in combination with increas-
ing North Atlantic precipitation, we already may be on the verge of substantial North
Atlantic climate disruption.

Storms conjoin with sea level rise to cause the most devastating coastal damage.
End-Eemian and projected 21st century conditions are similar in having warm tropics
and increased freshwater injection. Our simulations imply increasing storm strengths
for such situations, as a stronger temperature gradient caused by ice melt increases
baroclinicity and provides energy for more severe weather events. A strengthened
Bermuda High in the warm season increases prevailing northeasterlies that can help
account for stronger end-Eemian storms. Weakened cold season sea level pressure
south of Greenland favors occurrence of atmospheric blocking that can increase win-
tertime Arctic cold air intrusions into northern midlatitudes.

Effects of freshwater injection and resulting ocean stratification are occurring sooner
in the real world than in our model. We suggest that this is an effect of excessive small
scale mixing in our model that limits stratification, a problem that may exist in other
models (Hansen et al., 2011). We encourage similar simulations with other models,
with special attention to the models ability to maintain realistic stratification and pertur-
bations. This issue may be addressed in our model with increased vertical resolution,
more accurate finite differencing method in ocean dynamics that reduces noise, and
use of a smaller background diffusivity.

There are many other practical impacts of continued high fossil fuel emissions via cli-
mate change and ocean acidification, including irreplaceable loss of many species, as
reviewed elsewhere (IPCC, 2013, 2014; Hansen et al., 2013a). However, sea level rise
sets the lowest limit on allowable human-made climate forcing and CO2, because of the

extreme sensitivity of sea level to ocean warming and the devastating economic and
humanitarian impacts of a multi-meter sea level rise. Ice sheet response time is shorter
than the time for natural geologic processes to remove CO2 from the climate system,
so there is no morally defensible excuse to delay phase-out of fossil fuel emissions as
rapidly as possible.
We conclude that the 2 C global warming guardrail, affirmed in the Copenhagen
Accord (2009), does not provide safety, as such warming would likely yield sea level
rise of several meters along with numerous other severely disruptive consequences for
human society and ecosystems. The Eemian, less than 2 C warmer than pre-industrial
Earth, itself provides a clear indication of the danger, even though the orbital drive for
Eemian warming differed from todays human-made climate forcing. Ongoing changes
in the Southern Ocean, while global warming is less than 1 C, provide a strong warn-
ing, as observed changes tend to confirm the mechanisms amplifying change. Pre-
dicted effects, such as cooling of the surface ocean around Antarctica, are occurring
even faster than modeled.

Our finding of global cooling from ice melt calls into question whether global tem-
perature is the most fundamental metric for global climate in the 21st century. The first
order requirement to stabilize climate is to remove Earths energy imbalance, which is
now about +0.6 W m2, more energy coming in than going out. If other forcings are
unchanged, removing this imbalance requires reducing atmospheric CO2 from  400
to  350 ppm (Hansen et al., 2008, 2013a).

The message that the climate science delivers to policymakers, instead of defining
a safe guardrail, is that fossil fuel CO2 emissions must be reduced as rapidly as
practical. Hansen et al. (2013a) conclude that this implies a need for a rising carbon
fee or tax, an approach that has the potential to be near-global, as opposed to national
caps or goals for emission reductions. Although a carbon fee is the sine qua non for
phasing out emissions, the urgency of slowing emissions also implies other needs
including widespread technical cooperation in clean energy technologies (Hansen et
al., 2013a).

The task of achieving a reduction of atmospheric CO2 is formidable, but not impos-
sible. Rapid transition to abundant affordable carbon-free electricity is the core require-
ment, as that would also permit production of net-zero-carbon liquid fuels from elec-
tricity. The rate at which CO2 emissions must be reduced is about 6 % yr1 to reach
350 ppm atmospheric CO2 by about 2100, under the assumption that improved agri-
cultural and forestry practices could sequester 100 GtC (Hansen et al., 2013a). The
amount of CO2 fossil fuel emissions taken up by the ocean, soil and biosphere has
continued to increase (Fig. S23), thus providing hope that it may be possible to se-
quester more than 100 GtC. Improved understanding of the carbon cycle and non-CO2
forcings are needed, but it is clear that the essential requirement is to begin to phase
down fossil fuel CO2 emissions rapidly. It is also clear that continued high emissions
are likely to lock-in continued global energy imbalance, ocean warming, ice sheet dis-
integration, and large sea level rise, which young people and future generations would
not be able to avoid. Given the inertia of the climate and energy systems, and the grave
threat posed by continued high emissions, the matter is urgent and calls for emergency
cooperation among nations.

Figure 22. Schematic of stratification and precipitation amplifying feedbacks. Stratification:
increased freshwater/iceberg flux increases ocean vertical stratification, reduces AABW for-
mation, traps NADW heat, thus increasing ice shelf melting. Precipitation: increased freshwa-
ter/iceberg flux cools ocean mixed layer, increases sea ice area, causing increase of precipi-
tation that falls before it reaches Antarctica, adding to ocean surface freshening and reducing
ice sheet growth. A substantial amount of ice in West Antarctica and the Wilkes Basin, East
Antarctica is vulnerable because of the reduced stability of retrograde beds.
