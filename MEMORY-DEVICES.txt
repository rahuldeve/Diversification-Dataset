Categorizing Storage Devices
•

Storage devices hold data, even when the computer
is turned off.

•

The physical material that actually holds data is
called a storage medium. The surface of a floppy
disk is a storage medium.

•

The hardware that writes data to or reads data
from a storage medium is called a storage device. A
floppy disk drive is a storage device.

•

The two primary storage technologies are magnetic
and optical.

The primary types of magnetic storage are:
•

Diskettes (floppy disks)

•

Hard disks

•

High-capacity floppy disks

•

Disk cartridges

•

Magnetic tape

The primary types of optical storage are:
•

Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM)

•

Digital Video Disk Read-Only Memory
(DVD-ROM)

•

CD-Recordable (CD-R)

•

CD-Rewritable (CD-RW)

•

PhotoCD

How Magnetic Storage Works
•

A magnetic disk's medium contains iron particles,
which can be polarized—given a magnetic charge—in
one of two directions.

•

Each particle's direction represents a 1 (on) or 0 (off),
representing each bit of data that the CPU can
recognize.

•

A disk drive uses read/write heads containing
electromagnets to create magnetic charges on the
medium.

As the medium

Formatting
•

Before a magnetic disk can be used, it must be
formatted—a process that maps the disk's surface and
determines how data will be stored.

•

During formatting, the drive creates circular tracks
around the disk's surface, then divides each track into
sectors.

•

The OS organizes sectors into groups, called clusters,
then tracks each file's location according to the clusters
it occupies.

Formatted Disk

Disk Areas
When a disk is formatted, the OS creates four
areas on its surface:
•

Boot sector – stores the master boot record, a small
program that runs when you first start (boot) the
computer

•

File allocation table (FAT) – a log that records each
file's location and each sector's status

•

Root folder – enables the user to store data on the disk
in a logical way

•

Data area – the portion of the disk that actually holds
data

Magnetic Storage Devices ‐ Diskettes
•

Diskette drives, also known as floppy disk drives,
read and write to diskettes (called floppy disks or
floppies).

•

Diskettes are used to transfer files between
computers, as a means for distributing software, and
as a backup medium.

•

Diskettes come in two sizes: 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch.

Hard Disks
•

Hard disks use multiple platters, stacked on a
spindle. Each platter has two read/write heads, one
for each side.

•

Hard disks use higher-quality media and a faster
rotational speed than diskettes.

•

Removable hard disks combine high capacity with
the convenience of diskettes.

Read/write heads

Disk Capacities
•

Diskettes are available in different capacities, but
the most common store 1.44 MB.

•

Hard disks store large amounts of data. New PCs
feature hard disks with capacities of 10 GB and
higher.

Other Magnetic Storage Devices
•

High-capacity floppy disks offer capacities up to 250
MB and the portability of standard floppy disks.

•

Disk cartridges are like small removable hard disks,
and can store up to 2 GB.

•

Magnetic tape systems offer very slow data access,
but provide large capacities and low cost.

Due to long access times, tape
drives are used mainly for backups.

Other Optical Storage Devices

How Optical Storage Works

• An optical disk is a high-capacity storage medium.
An optical drive uses reflected light to read data.
• To store data, the disk's metal surface is covered with
tiny dents (pits) and flat spots (lands), which cause
light to be reflected differently.
• When an optical drive shines light into a pit, the light
cannot be reflected back. This represents a bit value
of 0 (off). A land reflects light back to its source,
representing a bit value of 1 (on).

CD‐ROM

•

In PCs, the most commonly used
optical storage technology is called
Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM).

•

A standard CD-ROM disk can store up to 650
MB of data, or about 70 minutes of audio.

•

Once data is written to a standard CD-ROM
disk, the data cannot be altered or overwritten.

CD‐ROM Speeds and Uses

• Early CD-ROM drives were called single speed, and
read data at a rate of 150 KBps. (Hard disks transfer
data at rates of 5 – 15 MBps).
• CD-ROM drives now can transfer data at speeds of
up to 7800 KBps. Data transfer speeds are getting
faster.
• CD-ROM is typically used to store software
programs. CDs can store audio and video data, as
well as text and program instructions.

DVD‐ROM
• A variation of CD-ROM is called Digital Video Disk
Read-Only Memory (DVD-ROM), and is being used
in place of CD-ROM in many newer PCs.
• Standard DVD disks store up to 9.4 GB of data—
enough to store an entire movie. Dual-layer DVD
disks can store up to 17 GB.
• DVD disks can store so much data because both sides
of the disk are used, along with sophisticated data
compression technologies.

Other Optical Storage Devices

• A CD-Recordable (CD-R) drive lets you record your
own CDs, but data cannot be overwritten once it is
recorded to the disk.
• A CD-Rewritable (CD-RW) drive lets you record a
CD, then write new data over the already recorded
data.
• PhotoCD technology is used to store digital
photographs.
