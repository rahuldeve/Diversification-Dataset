Abstract 

 
While studies in other industries suggest that firm type, firm size, and time are important factors 
that explain the cross-sectional variations in abnormal stock market returns, studies in the area of 
IS security are inconclusive. In this study, we examine whether the characteristics of the incident 
 Attacker type, attackers objective, results of the attack, attack tools and access type - influence 
the abnormal stock market return. Our results indicate that not all attacks have the same effect on 
the market value of companies. The results also help us create taxonomy of attacks and identify 
the  factors  that  the  market  views  as  detrimental  to  the  organization.  We  found  that  certain 
attacker  type,  the  result  of  the  attack  and  objective  of  the  attacker  and  the  tools  used  for  the 
attack  have  significant  impact  on  the  abnormal  stock  market  returns  while  the  type  of  access 
obtained have marginal effect on the market value of the firm.

Introduction 

The  importance  of  Internet  commerce  to  the  success  of  businesses  in  the  modern 
information  age  is  unquestionable.  Research  has  shown  that  information  security  is  one  of  the 
critical issues that cannot be ignored for successful implementation of e-commerce solutions and 
operations (Torkzadeh and Dhillon, 2002; Chang, Torkzadeh, and Dhillon, 2004). Also in a 2000 
Financial  Times  report,  the  director  of  the  National  Consumer  Council  was  quoted  as  saying, 
Unless the total online shopping environment  sites and payment mechanisms  is made more 
secure, some  consumers  will never have  confidence to explore the opportunities (Mackintosh, 
2000,  p2).  Further,  the  2006  CSI/FBI  Survey  on  computer  crime  and  security  reports  that  the 
percent of organizations that reported computer intrusion to law enforcement agents has reversed 
its yearly decline from a 20% the previous year to an all-time high of 25% albeit organizations 
concern  over  the  negative  publicity  for  making  such  reports  (Gordon,  Loeb,  Lucyshyn  and 
Richardson, 2006). The  reports also note economic and security risk management as of critical 
concern to organizations.

              In  this  paper,  we  define  Internet  security  in  terms  of  preserving  data  confidentiality, 
integrity  and  authenticity.  Hence  a  security  breach  occurs  if  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and 
authentication  of  a  firms  network  or  computers  are  compromised.  Internet  security  breaches 
could lead to lower sales revenues, higher expenses, a decrease in future profits and dividends, 
and  a  reduction  in  the  market  values  of  companies  which  are  compromised  (Power,  2002; 
Gordon, Loeb, and Lucyshyn, 2003).  
Measuring  the  economic  impact  on  Internet  security  breaches  will  help  in  risk 
 
management and information security planning. However, making information systems security 
investment  decisions  is  very  complex  and  difficult  (Gordon  and  Loeb,  2002).  Similar  to  the 
productivity  paradox  challenges  identified  in  the  information  systems  literature  (Dewan  and 
Kraemer,  1998),  productivity  paradox  arguments  have  also  been  made  in  the  information 
security  domain.  Dhillon  (2004),  for  example  identifies  this  as  an  information  security 
investment  paradox.  While  there  has  been  an  increased  spending  on  information  security 
measures, there has also been an exponential increase in the losses because of security breaches.  
Although information security researchers and practitioners recognize the seriousness of 
Internet security breaches, the relationship of the security incidents to the economic impact and 
valuation  of  the  firm  is  not  well  understood.    The  market  value  of  a  firm  corresponds  to  the 
confidence that investors have in that firm. Hence measuring the market value of a firm that has 
been  compromised  is  one  way  of  calculating  the  impact  of  Internet  security  breaches  and 
augments other economic studies. 

Prior studies investigated the relationships between an announcement of a security breach 
and market value of a firm (e.g., Cavusoglu, Mishra, and Raghunathan, 2004; Hovav and DArcy 
2003,  Hovav  and  DArcy  2004).  The  results  were  inconclusive.  These  studies  did  not 
differentiate between the type of attackers, the objectives of the attack, the results of the attack, 
tools used to attack, and the access type. The goal of this study is to extend current knowledge by 
investigating  the  relationships  between  the  above  mentioned  dimensions  of  an  attack  and  the 
market  value  of  the  firm.  Recently,  Andoh-Baidoo  and  Osei-Bryson  (2007)  have  considered 
these  variables.  Our  study  differs  from  that  work  in  two  ways:  (1)  we  use  traditional 
confirmatory approach rather than decision tree; and (2) our sample size is larger. The study uses 
an event study methodology. Such a methodology has been widely used to investigate the effect 
of  unexpected  IT  related  events  (e.g.,  Dos  Santos,  Peffers,  and  Mauer  1993,  Im,  Dow,  and 
Grover,  2001;  Oh  and  Kim,  2001;  Chatterjee,  Pacini,  and  Sambamurthy,  2002;  Dehning, 
Richardson, and Zmud, 2002).  

Literature Review  

 
Early studies in the area of IS security risk focused on the evaluation of financial damage 
caused by various types of security breaches. Ettredge et al. (2001) studied the spill-over effect 
of denial-of-service (DOS) attacks that occurred over a very short period - February 2000.  The 
study  found  significant  negative  impact  on  the  stock  value  of  firms  similar  to  the  attacked 
companies.  However,  due  to  clustering  effect,  the  significance  of  the  results  needs  to  be 
interpreted with caution. None of the subsequent studies were able to replicate the significance of 
the effect of the attacks on the market value of the attacked companies and the overall results are 
mixed.  Hovav  and  DArcy  (2003)  studied  the  impact  of  DOS  attacks  on  the  stock  price  of 
attacked companies and found little overall impact. However, the DOS attacks did have a larger

impact  on  Internet-centric  companies  than  on  other  companies.  Hovav  and  DArcy  (2004) 
studied the impact of computer virus announcements on the stock prices of attacked companies 
and found no significant effects. Other studies (Anthony et al., 2006; Cavusoglu et al., 2004) that 
examined  the  impact  of  various  security  breaches  on  the  market  value  of  firms  found  only  a 
minor effect. This effect was mostly limited to e-commerce companies.  

Campbell  et  al.  (2003)  found  that  the  market  differentiates  across  types  of  breaches. 
Specifically,  they  found  a  higher  negative  market  reaction  for  breaches  involving  confidential 
data relative to other types of breaches. Cavusoglu et al. (2004) studied the affect of the firm size 
and firm type on the market reaction to security attacks.  
Although  prior  research  made  some  progress  in  classifying  security  attacks  and  their 
 
varied affect on firms market value, the mixed results of these studies suggest that more work in 
the  area  is  necessary.  We  believe  that  the  characteristics  of  the  attack,  the  objectives  of  the 
attackers  and  the  goal  of  the  attack  will  influence  the  abnormal  (negative)  stock  market  return 
(Andoh-Baidoo  and  Osei-Bryson,  2007).  For  example,  an  attack  that  did  not  cause  major 
financial damage is expected to have lower impact than an attack that reported a major financial 
damage.  To  effectively  examine  the  above  assertion,  we  use  Howards  (1997)  taxonomy  of 
Internet security attacks and Internet security incidents.   

While  Howard  (1997)  developed  the  taxonomy  for  computer  and  network  attacks,  he 
showed  that  it  can  also  be  used  to  classify  Internet  security  incidents.  In  the  current  study,  we 
employ  Howards  taxonomy  to  investigate  the  moderating  effect  of  the  incident  characteristics 
on  the  market  value  of  the  attacked  companies.  Specifically  we  examine  the  impact  of  the 
attacker type, attackers objective, attack results, attack tools, and access type, on the abnormal 
(negative) stock market return. Howards taxonomy appears in Appendix B1. 

Hypothesis Development 

 
Based  on  the  discussion  above,  we  develop  five  hypotheses  related  to  each  of  the  five 
characteristics described in Howard (1997). 
 
Attacker Type 

In this paper we define attacker to mean an individual or group of individuals responsible 
for  the  Internet  security  incident.  Howard  (1997)  identifies  six  categories  of  attackers.  In  our 
sample  only  three  attacker  types  were  identified.  These  are  described  briefly.  In  a  particular 
announcement, the attacker left a note telling the attacked firm about how vulnerable its systems 
were.    Howard  (1997)  refers  to  this  group  of  attackers  as  hackers.  What  motivates  hackers  to 
attack is the desire to show their prowess and to raise their status in the community in which they 
operate. Professional criminals are individuals who operate on their own seeking financial gain 
from their activities. Vandals break into computer systems mainly to cause damage. 

 
 
Other kinds of attackers could use the vulnerabilities resulting from hackers activities to 
launch other attacks with more disastrous outcomes. However, if a firm responds quickly to the 
hackers  activities,  those  vulnerabilities  could  be  eliminated,  preventing  further  attacks.  While 
vandals cause damage, it may not be a financial damage. However, a response to a vandal could 

                                                 
1 Attackers,  Objective,  Results,  Tools,  and  Access  presented  in  Howards  Taxonomy  are  represented  as  Attacker 
type, Attackers objective, Attack results, Attack tools, and Access type respectively in this paper.

Pg 14-4 

 

be too when detected since damage could have been done already. Thus the Attacker type will 
influence  the  abnormal  stock  market  return.  Specifically  we  hypothesis  that  the  negative 
abnormal  returns  from  an  attack  by  a  professional  criminal  will  be  higher  than  the  negative 
returns from the other type of attacks We therefore state the hypothesis that: 

 
H1 There are significant differences between the negative abnormal returns of attacks by 
hackers, vandals and professional criminals.   

 
Attackers Objective 

Howard  (1997)  identified  four  types  of  objectives:  challenge/status,  damage,  financial 
gain, and political gain. None of the announcements in the sample was classified with a political 
gain  objective.    An  announcement  where  there  is  clear  intention  that  the  attacker  intended  to 
inform  the  breached  firm  or  firms  that  provide  computer  systems,  software,  or  network 
vulnerabilities is classified as having challenge/status objective. Here the attacker is challenging 
big  IT  firms  while  demonstrating  their  superior  expertise  to  a  community  of  hackers.  An 
announcement  where  it  is  found  that  the  attacker  threatens  to  publish  information  or  perform 
further damage if not compensated is classified as having financial gain as its objective. Attacks 
that cause damage without any negotiations are classified as damage for the attackers objective 
variable.  

Clearly, an attack geared towards financial gain will have greater financial impact than an 
attack where the  attacker challenges the firms  claim that its system is secured. Such an attack 
will  receive  more  attention  from  investors  and  will  therefore  have  different  impacts  on  stock 
market return. Therefore, we hypothesis that: 

 
H2: There are significant differences between the negative abnormal returns of attacks 
depending on the objectives of the attackers.   
 

Attack Results 

Howard (1997) identifies four different results of attack: corruption of information, denial 
of  service,  theft  of  service,  and  disclosure  of  information.  Prior  studies  found  little  impact  of 
Denial of service attacks on the market value of firms (Hovav and dArcy 2003). Companies can 
also avoid reporting the extent of damage resulting from attacks that corrupt their data. However, 
attacks  that  compromise  or  disclose  private  information  often  affects  a  large  number  of  people 
and  are  likely  to  get  much  attention.  Therefore,  each  of  these  results  could  have  a  different 
impact  on  the  breached  firms,  investors  will  also  react  differently.  Thus  we  develop  the 
following hypothesis: 

 
H3: There are significant differences between the negative abnormal returns of attacks 
depending on the results of the attacks.   
 

 
Attack Tools 

Howard  (1997)  claims  that  the  level  of  sophistication  of  the  tools  used  to  attack, 
continues to increase. The kinds of destruction and the level of access that the attacker can gain 
increase  with  the  increased  sophistication  of  tools  employed.  Two  specific  tools  that  were 
identified  in  our  sample  are:  Scripts/Programs,  and  Autonomous  agents.  Scripts/Programs 

In Proceedings of the 6th Annual Security Conference, April 11-12, 2007, Las Vegas, NV

involve attacks that resulted from defaults in software applications. Autonomous agents include 
viruses and worm attacks. It is likely that since more sophisticated tools can create more damage, 
their  impact  on  investors  reaction  will  be  higher.  Thus,  the  tool  employed  in  the  attack  could 
impact the abnormal stock market return. We develop the hypothesis: 

 
H4: There are significant differences between the negative abnormal returns of attacks 
depending on the tools used for the attack.   

Pg 14-5 

 
 
Access type 

Attacks can be internal or external. Internal attacks include disgruntled employees taking 
advantage  of  privileged  access  to  corporate  networks  to  perform  unauthorized  activities. 
Outsiders  usually  take  advantage  of  vulnerabilities  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  corporate 
networks. There are differing opinions (Howard, 1997) as to which type of access attackers use 
most. In spite of the different views, investors reactions could depend on which access type was 
employed by the attacker. Investors may consider unauthorized use as an error and unauthorized 
access as an organizations failure to prevent intruders from getting access to secured data or 
network  systems  leading  to  increase  negative  market  returns.  Firms  can  control  the  amount  of 
information  published  regarding  internal  attacks.  External  attacks  are  more  likely  to  get  more 
publicity. In an asymmetric information environment, investors will be more concerned with one 
type of access to another. Thus we define our final hypothesis as: 

 
H5:  There  are  significant  differences  between  the  negative  abnormal  returns  of  attacks 
depending on the type of access.   

Methodology 
 

Data Collection 

An event is defined as an announcement in one of the major newspapers about a security 
breach  in  a  firm.  Our  sample  included  announcements  for  the  period  1990  through  2003. 
Keywords  for  searching  events  include:  virus  names  (love  bug,  soBig,  and  blaster  worm); 
attacker  type  (hacker,  vandal);  result  of  attack  (denial  of  service,  theft  of  service),  names  of 
organizations reported in previous studies (Yahoo, eBay), or a term or combination of such terms 
as  (information  security  breach,  computer  system  security,  Internet  security  incident,  and 
breach).  

All  events  involving  governmental,  state,  local  and  non-profit  organizations  were  not 
considered.  Only  events  involving  publicly  traded  firms  were  included  in  this  study.  We 
recorded 310 events. However, we eliminated some events using the following criteria:  (1) some 
of the events were reported more than once in single or different newspapers.  In such cases, we 
kept only the first announcement; (2) only firms that were listed on New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE),  NASDAQ,  or  American  Stock  Exchange  (AMEX)  and  had  return  data  in  the  CRSP2  

                                                 
2 CRSP  is  a  financial  research  center  at  University  of  Chicago.  It  generates  and  maintains  leading  historical  US 
databases for stock (NASDAQ, AMEX, and NYSE), indices, bond, and mutual fund securities used by leaders in the 
academic and corporate communities for financial, economic, and accounting research.

database were included for analysis; (3) for firms in the CRSP database, the returns data had to 
be available for 120 days before the event  for the computation of stock market return;  and (4) 
where  there  were  confounding  effects  such  as  earning  announcements,  dividends  or  any  major 
announcement  during  the  event  window  involving  the  breached  firm,  the  event  was  dropped. 
After eliminating events based on the above criteria, our sample size was 185.   

 

Statistical Analysis and Measures of Variables 

 
A  three-day  event  period  covering  the  day  before  the  event  through  the  day  after  the 
event  was  used  in  this  study.  One  of  the  previous  studies  used  the  same  event  window 
(Cavusoglu  et  al.,  2004).  The  rationale  behind  this  length  of  period  is  that  investors  may  have 
pre-announcement  information  about  the  security  breach  and  may  react  before  the  market 
closes  a  day  before  the  announcement.  Alternatively,  breach  announcement  might  have  been 
made after 4PM on day t, which means that the entire reaction will occur on day t+1. We used 
120 days before the event to estimate the expected stock market return which is consistent with 
prior studies.

In addition to the above analysis we also ran partial ANOVA. These partial runs did not 

change the significance of the results. For additional details see Appendix A. 

 

Analysis 

 

The above results indicate that there is a difference in the market reaction based on the 
characteristics of the attack. The type of tool used by the attacker has a significant impact on the 
market  reaction,  thus  supporting  hypothesis  4.  Specifically,  attacks  using  scripts  resulted  in  a 
negative market reaction while attacks using autonomous agents such as viruses and worms did 
not. These results support the findings in Hovav and dArcy (2004). The type of access used by 
the  attacker  also  has  a  significant  affect  on  the  market  reaction  thus  supporting  hypothesis  5. 
However,  looking  at  the  data,  neither  access  type  resulted  in  a  negative  abnormal  return.  Thus 
our  conclusions  regarding  the  affect  of  the  access  type  on  the  market  reaction  are  limited.  The 
objective  of  the  attacker  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  market  reaction  thus  supporting 
hypothesis 2 ( = 0.038). Specifically, attacks intended for financial gain (type = 3) resulted in 
significantly  larger  negative  market  reaction  than  attacks  aimed  at  challenge  or  non-financial 
damage  (types  1  and  2).  The  type  of  the  attacker  also  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  market 
reaction thus supporting hypothesis 1 ( = 0.015). Specifically, attacks by professional criminals 
(type  =  3)  resulted  in  significantly  higher  negative  market  reaction  than  attacks  by  hackers  or 
vandals  (types  1  and  2).  The  most  significant  characteristic  is  the  end  result  of  the  attack.  The 
results of the attack had a significant impact on the market reaction thus supporting hypothesis 4 
( = 0.003). Specifically, disclosure of private information had a significantly larger impact on 
the market reaction (type = 3) while denial of service attacks and corruption of information had 
less affect on the market reaction.  

From  a  theoretical  perspective,  our  study  advances  our  understanding  of  the  types  of 
attacks,  and  the  type  of  attackers  that  pose  higher  risks  to  firms.  Our  findings  also  have  some 
implications for practitioners. Security managers need to decide where and how to allocate their 
security  budget.  Knowing  that  certain  security  breaches  have  larger  impact  on  the  value  of  a 
company,  managers  can  allocate  larger  portion  of  their  budgets  to  prevent  the  more  damaging 
attacks. 

Conclusion  

 

We have presented our results on an event study that seeks to examine the impact of the 
announcement  of  information  security  breaches  on  breached  firms.  Most  prior  studies  treat  all 
events  equally.  Our  study  attempts  to  identify  attack  and  attacker  characteristics  that  affect 
investor  reactions  and  differentiate  between  the  various  attacks.  Our  results  suggest  that  the 
objective  of  the  attack,  the  type  of  the  attacker  and  the  results  of  the  attack  have  significant 
moderating effect on the market reaction. Specifically, attacks by professional criminals, attacks 
that  aim  to  increase  financial  damage  and  attack  that  result  in  the  disclosure  of  private
