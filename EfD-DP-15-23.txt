The Role of Institutions in Community Wildlife 

Conservation in Zimbabwe 

Herbert Ntuli and Edwin Muchapondwa 

Abstract 

This study used a sample of 336 households and community-level data from 30 communities 

around Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe to analyse the association between institutions and 
cooperation (defined as the ability to self-organise) and the relationship between cooperation and 
success of biodiversity outcomes. Using both ordinary least squares and instrumental variables 
estimation with heteroskedasticity-based instruments, our results confirmed that sound institutions are 
indeed an important ingredient for cooperation in the respective communities and that cooperation 
positively and significantly affects biodiversity outcomes. Community-level trust, the number of 
stakeholders, punishment and group size were found to be important variables explaining cooperation. 
From a policy perspective, our results show that external enforcement of rules and regulations does not 
necessarily translate into sound ecological outcomes; rather, better outcomes are attainable when 
punishment is endogenized by local communities. This seems to suggest that communities should be 
supported in a way that promotes the emergence of robust institutions that are tailor-made to suit their 
local needs; this will, in turn, facilitate good environmental husbandry. Cooperation, training, benefits, 
distance from the nearest urban centre, distance from the fence of protected areas, social capital, average 
age of household head, new electric fencing and information sharing were found to be very important 
variables explaining the success of biodiversity outcomes. Government programmes should target 
capacity building in terms of institutional capacity and skills development in order to have a positive 
impact on biodiversity. Both stakeholders (e.g., non-governmental organisations and government) 
should have a role in capacity building; these roles should complement each other to ensure that the 
necessary resources are mobilized and all communities receive the necessary training.

The Role of Institutions in Community Wildlife 

Conservation in Zimbabwe 

Herbert Ntuli and Edwin Muchapondwa 

1. Introduction 

 

Wildlife conservation has become popular with policymakers and development 

practitioners alike as a vehicle for rural development because of abundant tourism opportunities 

in Southern Africa. A significant proportion of wildlife is managed as a common pool resource 

(CPR) under various forms of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) 
arrangements involving both local communities and private game farms.1 Wildlife shares some 

characteristics with other CPRs, such as water, forests, rangelands and fisheries, thus making its 

management and utilization under joint-use arrangements a daunting task. For instance, 

conservation efforts are affected by global market trends and by past and prevailing governance 

and institutional arrangements (Gibson and Marks 1995). The situation is made even worse by 

the fugitive character of the resource, which makes it difficult to assign property rights to 

wildlife (Muir-Leresche and Nelson 2000). 

The challenges associated with the management and utilization of CPRs in most 

developing countries have resulted in a search for policy options in an effort to make social-
ecological systems (SESs) sustainable2 over time. Following the publication of Hardin (1968), 

both state control and private ownership were embraced by colonial governments in the region as 

panaceas for all environmental problems. While both policy instruments have benefited minority 

groups and persisted even after independence, the colonial legacy created tension between 

wildlife authorities and local communities living adjacent to national parks (Songorwa 1999). At 

the rate at which wildlife is being decimated by local communities, the region could lose some of 

its prime wildlife species sooner than 2050 (Thuiller et al. 2006). This realization has led

1 Private game farms are normally organised into conservancies, which have dissolved their internal boundaries in 
order to manage wildlife as a common pool resource. Private game farms are referred to as landowner communities 
because each one usually comprises multiple private landholdings (Kreuter et al. 2010). 
2 Sustainability is defined as the ability of an ecosystem to provide goods and services today without compromising 
its ability to provide the same goods and services in the future (Brundtland et al. 1987).

policymakers to shift attention to people-oriented approaches rather than the conventional top-

down governance systems.   

This paper argues that the ability of a community to manage resources sustainably 

depends on the capacity of local communities to self-organise and that self-organisation depends 
on the nature of the institutions3 that are in place. Existing institutions have failed to protect 

wildlife and biodiversity, and hence there is a need for more ideas to feed into future policy or 

institutional reforms. The study was conducted in local communities around Gonarezhou 

National Park in Zimbabwe that are participating in community wildlife conservation. The global 

objective of this study is therefore to enhance our understanding of the role of local institutions 

in promoting sustainable management of CPRs, using Zimbabwes CAMPFIRE nature 
conservation programme4 as a case study. Following the discussion above, three important 

questions arise. Are there any practical differences in terms of resource units, resource users, and 

quality of institutions in common pool wildlife systems within and across communities? Under 

what conditions will the users of common pool wildlife self-organise? What attributes of 

resource units, resource users and local institutions are consistent with sound biodiversity 

outcomes? 

This paper contributes to the literature on common pool resources by applying Ostroms 

framework and collecting primary data on a little-studied topic. The framework has been used 

extensively in areas such as forestry, fisheries, rangelands and water resources management, 

while little has been done in the wildlife sector, particularly in Southern Africa. From a policy 

perspective, this paper sheds light on the processes governing human-environment systems and 

provides results comparable to other studies and ongoing projects. Furthermore, our research 

findings allow both policymakers and development practitioners to question their wildlife 

management strategies and policies while at the same time identifying areas that need to be 

improved. 

                                                 
3 North (1991) defined institutions broadly as humanly-devised constraints that structure political, economic and 
social interactions. In this paper, we define institutions as systems of established and prevalent social rules that 
structure social interactions (Hodgson 2006), including community-level organisations.  
4 The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) is a benefit-sharing 
scheme that involves local communities that live in the vicinity of national game parks and suffer wildlife intrusions. 
The programme was instituted by the government of Zimbabwe during the mid-1980s in order to create incentives to 
conserve wildlife by directly transferring benefits from conservation to the local communities.

This paper is organised into five sections. Section 1 presented the background, objective 

of the study and research questions, while Section 2 presents a review of the theory of collective 

action and the conceptual framework. Section 3 gives an outline of the research methods, i.e., the 

analytical framework, empirical model specifications and data issues. We then proceed to present 

and discuss the results in Section 4 and wind up with conclusions and policy implications in 

Section 5. 

2. Review of Theory  

2.1 Conceptual Framework 

This study employs the general framework for analysing complex social-ecological 

systems (SESs), as developed by Ostrom (2007). Figure 1 shows eight core subsystems that have 

been observed to affect both the ability of a community to self-organise and the sustainability of 

a resource system. In empirical work, many variables have been observed to affect the patterns 

of interaction and outcomes. In an earlier study, Agrawal (2001) identified more than 30 

variables that had been posited in major theoretical work to affect incentives, actors, and 

outcomes related to sustainable governance of a resource system. By unpacking the eight core 

subsystems and expanding on Agrawals work, Ostrom et al. (2007) went further to provide an 

even longer list of variables under each subsystem (see Table A.1 in the annexes). This 

framework helped to identify the variables that are relevant in studying community wildlife 

conservation, designing the research instrument and analysing findings about the sustainability of 

a SES.

By applying Ostroms framework, it is possible to analyse different environmental 

problems under different scenarios and predict the associated outcomes. Table 1 below shows 

how we can adapt this framework in the context of the wildlife sector in Southern Africa. For 

example, this study deals with a fugitive and finite renewable resource which is either harvested 

legally through trophy hunting activities by engaging a safari operator (in which case the 

community gets wildlife income, thereby maximizing societal welfare) or illegally by poachers, 

who maximize their individual short-term gains. Local communities are not allowed to hunt 

wildlife for their own purposes either inside or outside the national game park (i.e., in their own 

conservation area). The community does not benefit from tourism, research, wildlife 

photography or filming activities, implying that trophy hunting is their only means of generating 

revenue from conservation.  The community applies for a hunting quota from the Zimbabwe 

National Parks and Wildlife Authority and generates income by selling the quota to safari 

operators, who will in turn obtain clients through organized international events and sell the 

quota at a premium. The client or trophy hunter utilizes the quota. The most important 

institutions involved in community wildlife conservation are the wildlife management 

committee, park authorities, Rural District Councils (RDCs, the main administrative organ and 

entry point into the community) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

The interaction between the community and the resource system produces undesirable 

outcomes. For instance, harvesting levels by poachers exceed the maximum sustainable yield 

because they maximize personal gain. Therefore, if the communities in question are without 

the means of controlling extraction, then the end result is resource overexploitation and 

eventually total collapse of the social-ecological system. The prediction of resource collapse 

usually comes true in a very large and highly valuable resource system under open access 

conditions when users are diverse, do not communicate and have failed to develop 

institutions for managing resources (Berkes et al. 2006). 

2.2 The Collective Action Problem 

The theory of collective action5 has matured tremendously since the publication of 

Olson (1965), entitled The Logic of Collective Action. It relates to the group or individuals 

lack of capacity (except under certain conditions) to solve what is referred to as the 

                                                 
5 Collective action is defined as any action taken together by a group of people whose goal is to enhance or 
achieve a common objective (Olson 1965).

collective action problem. Resource economists and theorists ask questions about the 

conditions under which those who face the tragedy of the commons are able to organise a 

system of rules, monitoring and enforcement by which the tragedy is averted (Wade 1987). 

The analytical framework in contemporary analysis is that of a rational, self-interested 

individual who maximizes short-term gain while the society maximizes community welfare 

(Ostrom 2003). Conflict of interest exists between the communitys objective function and 

that of an individual. Of particular interest to this study is the literature that focuses on 

creating incentives for collective action through designing sound CPR institutions. What 

causes communities to develop institutions is the scarcity of natural resources and the need to 

avoid tragedy in the commons.  

There is a great deal of literature focusing on the role of punishment and social 

sanctioning or ostracism in promoting cooperation among resource users; much of this 

literature comes from the field of experimental economics (Fehr and Gachter 2000; Cardenas 

et al. 2000; Murphy and Cardenas 2004; and Akpalu and Martinsson 2011). Agrawal (2001) 

emphasizes the differences between a self-organised community and externally imposed 

collective action in terms of rule enforcement and sanctioning. Studies reveal that 

communities benefit when institutions are endogenized by the community, compared to the 

case when rules and regulations are externally enforced by the government (Murphy and 

Cardenas 2004; and Akpalu and Martinsson 2011). Community-based wildlife conservation 

in Zimbabwe, for example, relies to a great extent on state authorities to monitor and enforce 

rules and regulations, but the capacity to do so is limited by the budget. The knowledge of 

local collective action and informal institutions in natural resource management provides 

crucial information for designing policy instruments or interventions aimed at simultaneously 

addressing conservation and poverty issues.   

3. Research Methods  

3.1 Analytical Framework 

The paper utilizes both household survey data and key informant interviews. We 

provide a detailed characterization (mapping) of local CPR institutions of 25 CAMPFIRE 

projects and 5 communities from three resettlement schemes6. From a qualitative perspective, 

                                                 
6 Peasant farmers around Gonarezhou National Park are found under two different types of land tenure systems, 
namely, communal areas and resettlement schemes. The resettlement scheme is a product of the government of 
Zimbabwes land reform program created after independence in 1980, when the country embarked on a land 
redistribution exercise in which some of the land that belonged to large-scale commercial farmers was 
transferred to poor households from the overcrowded communal areas (Mushunje et al. 2003).

the analysis will articulate how institutions in different communities differ and why they 

differ given similar ecological conditions. This is followed by empirical model estimations to 

investigate the link between institutions and cooperation and the relationship between 

cooperation and success of biodiversity outcomes.  

3.2 Empirical Methods 

This study makes use of econometric modelling to establish the relationship between 

(a) cooperation and other institutional variables identified by Ostrom (2007) as affecting the 

likelihood of cooperation, and (b) cooperation (as well as other variables identified by 

Ostrom as affecting the sustainability of SESs) and ecological outcomes. 

3.2.1 Model 1: Participation in Community-Based Wildlife Management Programs     

A variable measuring ability to self-organise or a signal of cooperation is used as a 

dependent variable in our first model. This could be participation of individuals in 

community wildlife projects or activities at a community level. Following McCarthy et al. 

(2002) and Pennings and Leuthold (2000), ability to self-organise (cooperation) is assumed to 

be an unobservable latent variable. Factor analysis of variables thought to be associated with 

cooperative capacity is employed in order to recover the latent variable. Indicators of 

cooperation are drawn from two main categories, namely, networks and organisational 

performance variables. Network indicators include the density of organisations and density of 

household participation, while organisational performance indicators include the number of 

rules, regulations, activities and meetings. Mathematically, we write Model 1: 
 

 

To measure the quality of institutions in a community, we made use of the extended 

version of Ostroms (2010) design principles for stable local common pool resource 

institutions (refer to Table 2 below). A complete enumeration of CPR institutions in each 

community provided vital information for calculating an index of the quality of institutions. 

We then used this index plus other explanatory variables to explain cooperation, as described 

in Model 1 above.

3.2.2 Model 2: Success of Biodiversity Outcomes  

To measure the success of biodiversity outcomes across communities, a measure of 

relative abundance or diversity was used. The relative abundance of a species in a community 

is defined as the proportion of individual organisms in the community that belong to that 
species. Let

 be the relative abundance of species and

for

the number of 

species. We can define the Shannon index as:  

 

 

 

The Shannon index (S) provides important information about rarity and commonness 

of species in a community. Mouillot and Lepretre (1999) and Nagendra (2002) suggest that a 

good measure of species diversity should be able to capture two important dimensions of 

biodiversity, namely, species richness and species evenness. Thus, the Shannon index is a 

quantitative measure that reflects how many different groups, types or species there are in a 

data set. The value of S rarely exceeds 4 in most ecological studies and increases when the 

number of types (species richness) and the evenness increase. Although the index does not 

tell us anything about the endangeredness of a species, it is sufficient for the purposes of this 

analysis because it incorporates both components of biodiversity. Moreover, endangered 

species such as rhinos are not found in the communities in question.  

To calculate the Shannon index, we used information about animal counts 

(commercial species only) done by the RDC and the respective communities. Each year, 

communities keep information by type and species about the number of wild animals

traversing their conservation area7. The records are kept at the RDC offices and this 

information is then used by the community as justification when applying for a quota. Wild 

animal counting is done at the community level by a team of people that includes members 

from local communities, the RDC and sometimes park authorities. So, algebraically, we have 

the following equation linking biodiversity and cooperation, Model 2:    
 

 

Table 3 describes the explanatory variables that are used in the two models. The last 

column shows the expected signs of the variables. However, the expected signs of some 

variables could not be determined from the literature review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
7  The  communitys  conservation  area  (CA)  is  an  area  set  aside  by  the  community  for  the  purpose  of 
conservation. This is a requirement by the state for the community to participate in the CAMPFIRE programme. 
In  addition,  local  communities  are  tasked  to  continue  with  conservation  work  in  order  to  keep  their  land 
bordering the national park. Failure to comply with this requirement means that the community could risk losing 
part of its land.

We suspect the problem of endogeneity, particularly in the relationship between 

cooperation and biodiversity. This is because the theory posits that there is reverse causality 

between biodiversity outcomes and cooperation, i.e., less biodiversity (scarcity) translates 

into more cooperation in order to avoid the tragedy of the commons, and vice versa. As a 

result, some scholars argue that the incentive to self-organise does not always hold, especially 

when resources occur in abundance (Ostrom 1990). However, this is not the case in 
Zimbabwe because wildlife resources have declined tremendously since the turn of the 21st 

century. To put this into perspective, the wildlife management policy in the country speaks to 

the scarcity of resources. This is also the reason that the government institutionalized the 

CAMPFIRE programme in order to enhance the stock of wildlife. 

In the absence of institutions (rules, values, norms, etc.), it is difficult to measure 

cooperation because there is no reference point (or standard) against which we can compare 

peoples behaviour. Ostrom et al. (1994) distinguished between triggering institutions, which 

trigger cooperation among community members, and sustaining institutions, which are 

responsible for sustaining cooperation over time, thereby leading to sustainability of a SES. 

The authors suggested that triggering institutions should come first and cooperation later,

because people need to conform to some form of rules, norms or values. Based on this idea, 

the relationship between institutions and cooperation might be unidirectional, particularly for 

communities in which relevant institutions are not yet capable of addressing their current 

needs for resource management. Therefore, the endogeneity problem comes into play when 

we consider the effect of cooperation on institutions in a later phase of development, when 

community members demand better institutions in order to sustain cooperation after realizing 

the benefits accruing to the group as a whole.  

Furthermore, considering the literature on conditional cooperation, it can also be 

argued that the relationship between punishment and cooperation is unidirectional. This 

literature seems to suggest that cooperation by users of a common pool resource is 

conditional on punishment (e.g., Fehr and Gachter 2000; Masclet et al. 2003; Nikiforakis et 

al. 2007; and Herrmann et al. 2008) and on cooperation of others (Rustagi et al. 2011; 

Fischbacher and Gachter 2010; and Fischbacher et al. 2001). Punishment is part of the 

communitys institutions; it is administered to offenders so that people will cooperate with 

the rules, values or norms of the group. In this sense, we can view institutions as treatments 

and cooperation as an outcome.   

Because of the endogeneity issues discussed above, we first estimate the models using 

ordinary least squares (OLS), ignoring any issues of endogeneity. We then employ 

instrumental variables estimation with heteroskedasticity-based instruments, which 

methodologically deal with the problem of endogeneity, and compare the results. Following 

Lewbel (2012), this method estimates an instrumental variables regression model providing 

the option to generate instruments and allows the identification of structural parameters in 

regression models with endogeneity or mismeasured regressors in the absence of traditional 

identification information such as external instruments.  

Identification is achieved in this context by having explanatory variables that are 

uncorrelated with the product of heteroskedastic errors.8 Correlation in the error terms due to 

an unobserved common factor is a key feature in many models (Baum et al. 2013). According 

to Lewbel (2012), instruments may be constructed as simple functions of the models data. 

As a result, the approach may be applied in cases where no external instruments are available 

or used to supplement weak external instruments in order to improve the efficiency of the 

instrumental variables estimator.   

                                                 
8 The greater the degree of scale heteroskedasticity in the error process, the higher will be the correlation of the 
generated  instruments  with  included  endogenous  variables,  which  are  the  regressands  in  the  auxiliary  (first 
stage) regression (Lewbel 2012).

Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) in Zimbabwe that are participating in wildlife 

conservation. GNP is the second-largest game reserve in the country after Hwange National 

Park. It is located in south-eastern Zimbabwe (coordinates 210 40 S 310 40 E) and covers 
about 5 053 km2. It forms part of the Great Limpopo Trans-frontier Park that links 

Gonarezhou with Kruger National Park in South Africa and Limpopo National Park in 

Mozambique. Owing to its vast size, rugged terrain and location away from the main tourist 

routes, large tracks of Gonarezhou still remain pristine wilderness. Figure 2 below shows the 

map of GNP (in dark green) and the communal areas (in grey) bordering the national park.

Through household surveys and key informant interviews, the study collected data 

from a sample of 336 households and 30 key informants. Out of the 30 communities visited, 

25 are CAMPFIRE projects while the remainder, namely, Nyangambe, Chizvirizvi and 

Gonakudzingwa, are resettlement schemes (see Table 4 below). Although Gonakudzingwa 

has the least number of households (about 43), it had about three CPR groups, each with its 

own wildlife management committee, thereby bringing the total number of communities 

under resettlement schemes to five. Resettlement schemes differ from communal areas in that 

the former are located on private land that is subject to the laws governing the private tenure 

system in the country, while the latter have communal tenure.

By design, all CAMPFIRE projects were supposed to operate at ward level. However, 

due to conflict and unequal distribution of resources within communities, they had to split up 

in order to spread the benefits to every community member. About three communities were 

operating at ward level, i.e., Mahenye, Mutandahwe and Nyangambe. The rest of the wards 

are divided into several community groups ranging from two to six different sub-groups in a 

single ward. In the case of communal areas, these different community groups are referred to 
as CAMPFIRE villages.9

The household questionnaire collected information about the households socio-

economic characteristics, such as demographics, agricultural activities, assets, income, 

expenditure and involvement in community wildlife activities, while the key informant 

questionnaire collected information at the community level about the communitys 

involvement in wildlife activities. Secondary data was also collected from the respective 

RDCs to complement the survey data.  

The household survey employed a simple random sampling procedure using the list of 

beneficiaries from each community as the sampling frame. Initially, sampling was done using 

information gathered at district level from the RDC. There was a huge disparity between the 

information supplied at the district level and what was on the ground in terms of the number 

of community groups (projects) and number of households participating in community 

wildlife conservation, as the RDC did not update its records regularly. As a result, 

information gathered from the chairperson of the respective community groups was used to 

update the initial calculation of the sample size. This complicated the exercise because the 

information needed to keep the same sample size among the areas was not readily available. 

Table 5 below shows the number of households interviewed, by ward, against the 

total number of households participating in wildlife conservation in each ward, and ward 

population expressed in terms of households. The sample size was compromised by the fact 

that some enumerators did not meet their targets, particularly in areas that were sparsely 

populated, while some questionnaires were not usable due to non-response or lack of critical

information. Table 5 seems to suggest that Ward 8 and Ward 15 were over-sampled. The 

reason is that these two wards had the highest number of CAMPFIRE villages (groups) than 

any other ward, i.e., six and five groups respectively (refer to Table A.2 in the annexes).

4.1 Characterization of the Community and its Institutions 

The data shows great variability in terms of household, community and institutional 

characteristics. Table 6 shows that the average group size is about 451.6 and ranges from 6 to 

about 2000 households, depending on whether the community is operating at ward level and 
whether we are talking about CAMPFIRE projects or resettlement schemes10. The average

number of ethnic groups for the communities in question is 2.6. The data shows that the 

average age of the head of the household is 48.9 and ranges from about 22 to 89 years. About 

50.0% of the communities have managed to endogenize punishment; they have systems in 

place for monitoring and enforcing rules and regulations, but the degree to which punishment 

is internalised varies as we move from one community to another. Whether monitoring and 

enforcement are externally done by a third party or internalized by local communities has 

implications for cooperation, which in turn affects the success of biodiversity outcomes. 

10 As part of the land reform programme during the 1990s, peasant farmers were allocated plots around 
Gonarezhou National Park that were previously reserved for white commercial farmers.

The benefits from wildlife conservation range from 0 to US$68 880.00 during the 

survey period, with a mean of US$20 047.00, while the average size of the conservation area 

is 14 186 hectares (ha), ranging from about 7 614 ha to 26 000 ha. In some communities, the 

conservation area has been greatly reduced because the fence of the national park has recently 

expanded its boundaries, partly due to pressure from the state to increase land under 

conservation and the availability of donor funding. This affected the benefits flow because 

some communities are no longer entitled to benefits. About 62.5% of the committee members 

in the respective communities have received some form of training, some of which was 

related to wildlife management. A number of stakeholders were involved in administering the 

training, including the RDC, Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority and several 
local NGOs.11 The average number of stakeholders was 4.2 per community, which is quite

substantial given the size of the area under consideration (refer to Table A.3 in the annexes).

Table 7 below shows that the performance of most communities in the study area is 

well below the desirable level in terms of many characteristics that matter for conservation. 

On a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies the complete absence and 100 the complete 

presence of an attribute, all community attributes in Table 7 fall below half (50.0), except for 

11 Training offered by these organisations ranges from basic courses, such as bookkeeping or record keeping, to 
specialised courses, such as constitution development, leadership courses, veldt fire management, training for 
armed game guards (including the use of firearms) and general wildlife management (including animal 
counting, provision of watering points, trophy quality, live animal cropping, etc.).

information sharing, which has a mean of about 60.56. Most communities share vital 

information such as financial matters, past actions and knowledge of the SES, mainly through 

village meetings. The mean level of cooperation is about 39.26, while the mean for the 

overall institutional index is 34.06. Disaggregating the institutional index into four attributes, 

namely, clarity of institutions, fairness, governance (including participation and democracy) 

and monitoring and enforcement (including formal punishment and social sanctioning), we 

observe that the mean of each attribute is still worrisome, especially for the governance, 

participation and democracy index. This seems to suggest that, in most communities, the 

quality of local institutions is very poor. This could have implications for cooperation in a 

community.

* Indices for institutional characteristics ** The Shannon index for biodiversity

In general, qualitative interviews revealed that communities that joined the 

CAMPFIRE programme earlier had better institutions in place compared to communities that 
either joined later or are operating outside the programme, except for Nyangambe.12 The

discrepancies in institutional characteristics across communities can be attributed to the fact 

that communities that started earlier, such as the Mahenye CAMPFIRE project, enjoyed a lot 

of donor funding and privileges from the state, which led to their success. This also meant 

that the relationship between earlier communities and state authorities improved over time 

because of the attention they got from the international community. Furthermore, these 

communities had ample time to learn from their own mistakes, experiences and past 

achievements and hence adapted accordingly. In addition to this, such communities also 

12  Its  success  came  from  the  fact  that  the  community  was  part  of  the  Save  Valley  Conservancy  from  its 
establishment and  was  involved in  wildlife conservation  from 1990 until 2004,  when  Nyangambe temporarily 
pulled out due to political interference in the conservancy.

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

received adequate training to build their own institutional capacity from the CAMPFIRE 

programme itself, state apparatus and various other local and international non-governmental 

organisations that were involved in wildlife conservation at that time. 

Table A.4 in the annexes shows that community involvement in wildlife conservation 

in the study area varied significantly across communities. Most respondents (96.7%) 

indicated that the community uses awareness campaigns as a vehicle to fight illegal 

harvesting of wildlife, to educate the community and to foster cooperation, while 59.5% 

indicated that they actually carry out anti-poaching activities. About 42.3% indicated that 

they have a veldt fire management committee in place, while 36.3% use whistle-blowers to 

alert the authorities to any illegal activities happening in their community. Fewer respondents 
indicated that the community participates in quota setting (32.4%) or game cropping13

(12.5%).  

About 38.7% of the respondents stated that they enjoyed use rights, while 33.6% 

indicated decision-making rights (refer to Table A.5 in the annexes). When asked about the 

extent to which the communities enjoy both use and decision-making rights on a scale from 0 

to 10, there is great variation in the observations across projects, with means of 1.97 for use 

rights and 1.55 for decision making. About 91.3% of the respondents indicated that the option 

to enter or exit is not available for community members, while 66.4% indicated that the 

community is not able to exclude external or untitled parties. Many respondents (about 

86.0%) were aware of the existence of a constitution for the community, while fewer 

respondents (25.6%) were aware of the existence of a wildlife management plan. It is 

essential at this stage to highlight that wildlife management committees exist for all 

communities (100.0%) since this is a requirement for local communities to be recognised by 

the state as a conservation group and for them to benefit from wildlife conservation. 

Table A.6 in the annexes shows the number of rules, meetings and activities, and the 

participation rates for each. On average, using a scale from 0  10, the extent to which 

community rules are recognized by community members and higher level authorities is 3.51 

and 6.10, respectively. This indicates that a number of communities still have problems in 

terms of rule compliance. This is also supported by the high number of poaching incidents 

(about 7.9 per year) in the study area. 

13  Eltringam  (1994)  defines  game  cropping  as  the  taking  of  a  sustainable  yield  from  a  completely  wild 
population. This definition implies regular harvest from a wild population. Cropping would have the objective 
of either wild animal population control or harvesting to provide bushmeat and other wild animal products for 
local consumption and/or for income generation.

4.2 Results of the Regression Models 

This paper argues that institutions directly affect cooperation (defined as the ability to 

self-organise) and indirectly influence the success of biodiversity outcomes through 

cooperation. Using regression analysis techniques, we analyse the association between 

institutions and cooperation and the relationship between cooperation and success of 

biodiversity outcomes. As stated earlier, we are aware of the endogeneity problem; although 

we did not expect our data to suffer from it, it has to be corrected. First, we ignore any 

endogeneity issues and use ordinary least squares regression analysis, and then we use 

instrumental variables estimation with heteroskedasticity-based instruments to 

methodologically deal with the problem.  

The Durbin-Wu-Hausman tests for endogeneity (refer to Table A.7 in the annexes) 

seem to suggest that OLS yields better results in the first model (relationship between 

cooperation and institutions) while the instrumental variables estimation with 

heteroskedasticity-based instruments yields superior results in the second model (relationship 

between biodiversity and cooperation). The VIF tests show that multicollinearity is not a 

severe problem for either model (please refer to Table A.8 in the annexes). The rule of thumb 

suggests that the VIF should be less than 10; otherwise, we have multicollinearity issues 

(Menard 1995; Neter et al. 1989; and OBrien 2007). Furthermore, the correlation results in 

Table A.16 and Table A.17 in the annexes also support the results of the VIF test above. 

Table A.9, Table A.10 and Table A.11 in the annexes show the results of the under-

identification, weak identification, over-identification and heteroskedasticity tests obtained 

from the instrumental variables estimation models. Under the null hypothesis that the 

equation is under-identified, the Kleibergen-Paap test shows that it is safe to proceed with the 

instrumental variables estimation with heteroskedasticity-based instruments in both models. 

Usually, the p-value should be very small in order to reject the null hypothesis in favour of 

the alternative hypothesis that the equation is not under-identified. The rule of thumb for the 

weak identification test using the Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic suggests that we reject the 

null hypothesis of weak identification if the F-statistic is large. Weak identification arises 

when the excluded instruments are weakly correlated with the endogenous regressors. 

Estimators can perform poorly when instruments are weak.  

The Hansen J statistic for testing over-identification of all instruments also reveals 

that it is safe to use instrumental variables estimation with heteroskedasticity-based 

instruments in both models under the joint null hypothesis that the instruments are valid 

instruments, i.e., uncorrelated with the error term, and that the excluded instruments are 

correctly excluded from the estimated equation. A rejection casts doubt on the validity of the 

18 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

instruments. Therefore, the p-value must be very large in order not to reject our null 

hypothesis.  

Because we are considering about 30 observations (30 communities), there is a worry 

that we might be dealing with too few observations. One way to deal with that is 

bootstrapping. We applied the bootstrapping procedure to check for robustness of the 

standard errors and found that the results are consistent with each other. Tables A.13 through 

A.15 in the annexes show that our results do not vary significantly from the original results. 

We take this to be a validation of our results and, henceforth, we will interpret them. In the 

section below, we present both OLS and instrumental variables estimation results for both 

models. 

4.2.1 Regression Model 1: Relationship between Cooperation and Institutions 

The results in Table 8 show that both the OLS regression model and the instrumental 

variables estimation are highly significant and explain over 80.0% of the variation in the 

dependent variable. We consider two models, a model with the overall institutional index and 
another with disaggregated institutional indices.14 Replacing the overall institutional index

with disaggregated institutional indices does not affect the signs of the explanatory variables 

in the model and so the interpretation remains the same. Comparing OLS and the IV results, 

we observe that most variables are highly significant, except for group size, ethnicity, 

resource size and wealth. The variable ethnicity measures heterogeneity in a community or 

group, but the variable is insignificant in both models, suggesting that ethnicity is not an 

important variable explaining cooperation in the area. However, with disaggregated 

institutional indices, group size, resource size and wealth become significant under both OLS 

and IV estimation, implying that cooperation is explained better with the latter model than 

with the former.  

14  As  highlighted  earlier,  the  overall  institutional  index  can  be  disaggregated  into  four  institutional 
characteristics:  clarity  of  institutions,  fairness,  governance  and  monitoring,  and  enforcement.  The  objective  of 
disaggregating  the  overall  institutional  index  into  these  four  attributes  is  to  establish  those  characteristics  of 
institutions that matter most for cooperation.

The results above show that the institutional variable is positive and significant at the 

1% level of significance. This seems to suggest that an improvement in the quality of 

institutions increases cooperation in the respective communities. This result is consistent with 

20 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

theory and confirms our hypothesis that institutions matter for self-organisation, i.e., good 

institutions translate into higher levels of cooperation and vice versa. It is important to note at 

this point that all communities in the study area have managed to develop some form of 

institutions, although these institutions differ in terms of their characteristics as we move 

from one community to another. Hence, we can rule out the possibility of an open access 

regime where members of the community can access resources at any time without restraint, 

i.e., a system where there are no rules governing access to and utilization of resources.

When we consider the model with the disaggregated institutional index, we observe 

that both the governance index and the monitoring and enforcement index are highly 

significant and positive, suggesting that an improvement in these variables might increase 

cooperation. Our results suggest that governance and monitoring and enforcement are more 

important for cooperation than are fairness and clarity of institutions. The results underscore 

the need for institutional arrangements that allow local communities to fully participate in 

wildlife conservation, govern their resources in a democratic way, monitor each other, and 

enforce rules and regulations internally; these measures are more likely to encourage higher 

levels of cooperation, with possible implications for biodiversity outcomes.  

However, to our surprise, the fairness index is highly significant and carries a 

negative sign. This is a little problematic. Because we collected qualitative data, a possible 

explanation for this anomaly could be that beneficiaries closer to the park fence frequently 

suffer from wildlife intrusion and hence they feel that they should be treated differently from 

those farther away from the fence. This also explains why group size is very unstable at the 

ward level and why communities frequently divide into smaller groups in order to ensure that 

communities that suffer more from wildlife intrusion benefit more than those farther away. 

Community-level trust, year of establishment, punishment and number of 

stakeholders have positive and significant impacts on cooperation. This seems to suggest that 

cooperation is better in communities where members trust each other than in communities 

where trust is lacking. As suggested in the previous section, cooperation is higher in 

communities that joined wildlife conservation earlier than in communities that joined later. 

This makes sense because the longer a community is involved in wildlife conservation, the 

more likely it is for that community to develop robust institutions that are adapted to local 

conditions. Cooperation is also higher in communities that have endogenized punishment as 

opposed to communities that still rely on external force in order to enforce adherence to rules 

and regulations. 

Policymakers and development practitioners should seriously consider institutional 

reforms that convey greater control of natural resources through devolution and 

decentralization of managerial functions, decision making and authority into the hands of 

21 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

local communities, while the state maintains regulatory functions. Ostrom et al. (2007) argue 

that it is cheaper for local communities to engage in monitoring and enforcement activities 

than it is for the state apparatus to do so, due to budgetary and information constraints. Our 

results also reveal that cooperation increases with an increase in the number of stakeholders. 

This is true in the study area because there are a number of NGOs working with local 

communities in wildlife conservation, particularly in providing training or capacity building.  

The tenure variable is negative and highly significant (at 1%) under both models, 

implying a negative relationship between tenure and cooperation. This suggests that 

cooperation declines as we move from communal areas into the resettlement schemes. This is 

true for two main reasons. Firstly, the resettlement schemes are comprised of private land 

holders operating on individual plots, who are thus maximizing individual objectives at the 

farm level but not as a community. Given the nature of resettlement schemes, it is difficult for 

park authorities to monitor and enforce rules on private property unless farm owners come 

together and act as a community in order to achieve a common objective of conservation. 

Secondly, unlike in communal areas where institutions bring people together, in resettlement 

schemes such institutions do not exist; farmers act individually and no one knows what the 

other farmer is doing on his farm. 

Furthermore, with the introduction of disaggregated institutional indices, group size, 

the size of the resource system and wealth become significant under both models, although 

the interpretation is a little bit problematic. Our results show that there is a significant and 

positive relationship between group size and cooperation. In general, theory posits that the 

effect of group size on self-organisation tends to be negative, given the higher transaction 

costs associated with getting people together and agreeing on important issues (Ostrom 2009; 

Wade 1994). However, if the tasks of managing a resource system are very costly (e.g., 

monitoring an extensive resource system), larger groups are in a better position to mobilize 

the necessary resources required for such undertakings. Hence, the size of the group is always 

relevant, but its influence on the ability of a community to self-organise is contingent on 

other variables of the SES and the type of management activities in question (Ostrom 2009). 

The results also show that the level of cooperation in a community declines as the size 

of a resource system increases. Chhatre and Agrawal (2008) argue that self-organisation is 

more unlikely in very large and very small resource systems. The reason could be that very 

large resource systems are associated with high costs of defining boundaries, monitoring and 

enforcement, and gaining ecological knowledge, while very small resource systems do not 

generate substantial flows of valuable products. Hence, a moderate-sized resource system is 

most conducive to self-organisation. We therefore argue that, for most communities 

considered in the study area, the resource system is big enough to generate tangible benefits, 

22 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

and communities with a smaller conservation area and larger group size are better off in 

terms of fostering cooperation than communities with a larger conservation area and smaller 

group size. 

Surprisingly, the wealth index becomes significant and still carries a positive sign 

under both models when the disaggregated institutional attributes are introduced, suggesting 

more cooperation in wealthier communities than in poor communities. The conventional 

wisdom from field experiments suggests that, at the group level, both average group wealth 

and variance in the distribution of wealth decrease the level of cooperation or social 

efficiency achieved by the group (Ostrom et al. 1994; Cardenas 2003). This could be a result 

of measurement error.   

4.2.2 Regression Model 2: Relationship between Biodiversity and Cooperation 

Both OLS and IV estimation models are significant at the 1% level and explain over 

72.2% of the variation in our dependent variable (please refer to Table 9 below). Although 

the Durbin-Wu-Hausman tests suggest that IV estimation with heteroskedasticity-based 

instruments is superior to its OLS counterpart, all variables in both models are significant and 

do not vary much in terms of their coefficients, standard errors and the level of significance 

for the two models.  

The results in Table 9 show that cooperation is positive and highly significant. This 

implies that cooperation is an important variable explaining biodiversity outcomes, as 

suggested in the CPR literature. Hence, we expect to find more sound ecological outcomes in 

those communities with high levels of cooperation and strong institutions than in 

communities with less cooperation and weak institutions. We maintain that institutions affect 

biodiversity outcomes indirectly, through ability to self-organise, or cooperation. 

Alternatively, we might think of cooperation as refraining from illegal harvesting of wildlife 

resources, so that, in areas where the level of cooperation is very low and poaching activities 

are rife, wildlife is either quickly decimated due to overharvesting or may respond to higher 

levels of poaching by retreating back into the park, thereby leaving few wild animals in the 

communitys conservation area. As a result, a community that is less poached has more 

animals in its vicinity than does a community that is heavily poached.

As expected, training is positive and highly significant, implying that this variable is an 

important factor explaining the success of biodiversity outcomes. This implies that communities 

that received training are better off in terms of managing and conserving wildlife than are 

communities where training has not been administered. However, not all communities have 

received training relevant to wildlife management. The number of households and communities 

24 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

involved in wildlife conservation is growing, signalling the need for more training in the study 

area. Qualitative interviews also revealed that committee membership changes quite frequently 

and, at times, there is a total overhaul of the entire management committee, which may severely 

affect operations. There is therefore a need for continuous training so that the institutional 

memory and entrepreneurial and leadership skills acquired through training are not lost when 

such a dramatic change occurs. Therefore, government programmes should target capacity 

building in terms of institutional capacity and skills development in order to have a positive and 

significant impact on biodiversity. 

As expected, the benefits from wildlife conservation significantly and positively affect 

biodiversity outcomes in a community. If the resource system is very important in the eyes of the 

users and generates a substantial flow of benefits, then users attach high value to sustainability of 

the resource (Berkes and Folke 1998; and Chhatre and Agrawal 2008); otherwise, the cost of 

organising and maintaining a self-organised system may not be worth the effort (National 

Research Council 2002). Communities from the study area have come to realize that using the 

proceeds from wildlife conservation to invest in public goods such as schools, clinics, water, 

grinding mills, and electricity is much more beneficial than getting dividends at the household 

level. Viewed from this angle, the benefits from wildlife conservation are tangible in the eyes of 

the community and therefore community wildlife conservation is very successful. This line of 

reasoning differs from previous studies which considered benefits in terms of income flowing 

directly into the household. 

Market integration and global market trends are viewed worldwide as potential threats to 

wildlife conservation in developing countries. In this paper, we used distance to the nearest urban 

centre as a proxy for market integration. The variable distance to the nearest urban centre is 

positive and highly significant, suggesting that biodiversity outcomes improve as the distance to 

the market increases. We argue that the incentives for poaching are much higher for those 

communities that are located closer to urban centres or main routes linking rural communities to 

urban areas because animals and game fetch higher prices in wider markets. Qualitative 

interviews with key informants revealed substantial evidence of game meat being sold on the 

black market in almost all the communities visited during the survey period and, under certain 

circumstances, poachers transporting game meat to distant markets such as growth points and 

urban centres.  

On the other hand, communities that are located closer to the fences are less likely to 

conserve biodiversity because they suffer more from wildlife intrusion, interact with wildlife 

quite frequently and hence have greater access to wildlife than those communities located further 

25 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

away. This is confirmed by our results: the variable measuring distance to the fence is positive 

and highly significant. In other words, as the distance to the fence increases, biodiversity 

outcomes improve significantly. Our results seem to suggest that biodiversity outcomes are more 

successful for those communities that are located far away from urban centres or routes 

connecting rural communities to urban centres but are not very close to the boundary of the game 

park.  

Social capital is also an important variable explaining the success of biodiversity 

outcomes. The variable is positive and significant. Social capital may either help to conserve or 

destroy biodiversity depending on the nature of the relationship. If social capital is high in a 

community, such that households have links both inside and outside the community, then these 

households are more likely to get assistance in times of need and hence less likely to depend on 

illegal harvesting of wildlife resources. This is true for some communities in the study area 

because they have more children or relatives working in urban areas or abroad in South Africa. If 

households are connected at the community level (through common understanding, common 

interests, respect for each other and the need to maintain a long-term relationship that is 

beneficial to everyone), they are more likely to make decisions as a community. This minimizes 

the possibility of social deviance while at the same time enhancing societys welfare. 

The average age of the household head is significant and negatively related to the success 

of biodiversity outcomes. This implies that, as the age of the household head increases, 

biodiversity outcomes worsen. Godoy et al. (1997) reported that the age of household head may 

be positively related to resource-based income until a point where resource use declines with 

age, coupled with children moving away to seek new opportunities and start their own 

households elsewhere. Including a quadratic term for the average age of the household head does 

not affect our results much. Table A.12 demonstrates that, as the age of the household head 

increases, biodiversity outcomes deteriorate up to a certain age (51.4 years), when poaching 

ceases to be an important livelihood activity for the household head due to old age. This suggests 

a positive relationship between the age of the household head and income based on resource use. 

Surprisingly, number of years in school and number of years living in the area for the 

household head are both significant and negatively related to biodiversity outcomes. 

Expectations were that, as the number of years in school and the number of years living in the 

area increases, biodiversity outcomes would improve. This result could be due to the alternative 

sources of income brought about by an additional year in school, which might make it less 

financially important to participate in wildlife conservation, and the knowledge about animal 

movements acquired by the household head over a number of years. If the benefits from wildlife 

26 

Environment for Development 

Ntuli and Muchapondwa 

conservation are negligible relative to other sources of income, the incentives to conserve 

wildlife are eroded and the household finds it rational to poach, as the benefits accruing to the 

household are much greater.     

An interesting development in the study area is the idea of putting an electric fence 

around Gonarezhou National Park in order to conserve wildlife and reduce human-wildlife 

conflict. The project has already started with support from donor funding and its completion 

depends heavily on the availability of these funds. Most communities have lost part of their 

conservation area to the national park and the number is growing with an increase in the area of 

the park covered by the electric fence. Beneficiaries of conservation payments view this 

development as a potential threat to the CAMPFIRE project. Our results show that the fence 

reduces biodiversity in the communitys conservation area. This is true for two main reasons. 

Firstly, the fence greatly reduces the number of wild animals moving into the communitys 

conservation area from the park. Secondly, the electric fence greatly reduces the benefits from 

wildlife conservation, thereby eroding the communitys incentives to conserve wildlife 

resources. As a result, the local community might fight back by increasing its poaching effort, 

leading to resource overexploitation and finally exhaustion of all resident species and those that 
can make it across the fence.15

According to Ostrom (2007), information sharing is one of the most important variables 

that can affect ecological outcomes. During meetings, communities share vital information about 

past actions, progress updates, general finance matters, fire outbreaks, watering points, poaching 

and knowledge of the SES, in addition to their usual community agendas. Our results show that 

biodiversity improves when the community is able to share information. Sharing information 

entails both responsibility and accountability of community leadership, which will in turn 

facilitate the development of a relationship based on trust and honesty. In addition, when users 

share common knowledge of relevant SES attributes, rules and regulations, and how their actions 

affect each other, they will perceive lower costs of organising (Ostrom 2009; and Berkes and 

Folke 1998). 

15 Predators and small plains game that can sneak under the fence in rugged terrain are still able to move inside and 
outside the park and interact with human beings. Furthermore, elephants can still damage the electric fence if they 
have mastered the technique of doing so.

5. Conclusions and Policy Recommendations

This study used a sample of 336 households and community-level data from 30 

communities to analyse (i) the relationship between ability to self-organise and institutions, 

among other variables identified as affecting collective action; and (ii) the relationship between 

success of biodiversity outcomes and cooperation among variables, identified as enhancing the 

sustainability of a resource system. To achieve this, the study relied heavily on Ostroms general 

framework for analysing complex social-ecological systems. We used ordinary least squares 

regression analysis and instrumental variables estimation with heteroskedasticity-based 

instruments. This approach methodologically deals with the endogeneity problem associated 

with the relationships above.  

Our results confirmed that sound institutions are indeed an important ingredient for 

cooperation. Improvements in institutional attributes such as governance (participation and 

democracy) and monitoring and enforcement might lead to increased cooperation, while fairness 

and clarity of institutions were found to be less important. Community-level trust, punishment, 

number of stakeholders and tenure were also found to be important variables explaining 

cooperation. With the introduction of disaggregated institutional indices, group size, the size of 

the resource system and wealth become significant, although the interpretation was problematic.  

Furthermore, cooperation had a positive and significant impact on biodiversity outcomes, 

suggesting that higher levels of cooperation might translate into a healthy wildlife population. 

We therefore argue that institutions directly affect cooperation, and indirectly influence 

biodiversity outcomes through cooperation. Cooperation, training, benefits, distance from the 

nearest urban centre, distance from the park fence, social capital, and information sharing were 

found to have a positive and significant impact on biodiversity outcomes. The average age of the 

household head, number of years in school, number of years living in the area and proximity to 

the park fence had a negative and significant impact on biodiversity. 

From a policy perspective, our results show that external enforcement of rules and 

regulations does not necessarily translate into sound ecological outcomes; rather, better outcomes 

are attainable when punishment is endogenized by local communities. This seems to suggest that 

communities should be supported in a way that promotes the emergence of robust institutions 

that are tailor-made to suit local needs; this will, in turn, facilitate good environmental 

husbandry. Future policy reforms should also consider the possibility of giving full autonomy to 

local communities so that they can monitor each other and internalize enforcement of rules and 

regulations.  

28

State authorities should reconsider the way in which they engage with farmers under 

resettlement schemes, because biodiversity suffers more under this type of arrangement than in 

communal areas. There is a need for appropriate institutional reforms that allow park authorities 

to work closely with resettlement schemes, while at the same time giving incentives for plot 

holders to work together for the improvement of the common pool resource. For example, 

farmers in resettlement schemes could set aside land for conservation by pooling resources 

instead of operating at plot level, which works against conservation efforts. 

Training, benefits and fencing could have important implications for policy formulation 

and design. For instance, government programmes can target capacity building in terms of 

institutional capacity and skills development in order to have a positive impact on biodiversity. 

Therefore, the capacity building efforts of government agencies, NGOs and other stakeholders 

should complement each other to ensure that the necessary resources are mobilized and all 

communities receive the necessary training and resources. Both the extent to which communities 

benefit from wildlife conservation and the extent to which they are allowed to make important 

decisions about how benefits are distributed and used by the community affect incentives to 

conserve wildlife. Fencing the national park has a detrimental effect on the CAMPFIRE project 

and the lives of people whose livelihoods depend on wildlife conservation.
