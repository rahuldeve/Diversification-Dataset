Biosynthetically directed fractional 13C labeling of the proteino-
genic amino acids is achieved by feeding a mixture of uniformly
13C-labeled and unlabeled carbon source compounds into a bioreac-
tion network. Analysis of the resulting labeling pattern enables both
a comprehensive characterization of the network topology and the
determination of metabolic flux ratios. Attractive features with
regard to routine applications are (i) an inherently small demand
for 13C-labeled source compounds and (ii) the high sensitivity of
two-dimensional [ 13C, 1H]-correlation nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy for analysis of 13C-labeling patterns. A user-friendly
program, FCAL, is available to allow rapid data analysis. This novel
approach, which recently also has been employed in conjunction with
metabolic flux balancing to obtain reliable estimates of in vivo
fluxes, enables efficient support of metabolic engineering and
biotechnology process design. (cid:23) 1999 Academic Press

optimizing bioprocess parameters and(cid:18)or genetic mani-
pulations (Bailey, 1991). The operation of bioreaction
networks represents highly nonlinear processes of holistic
nature, so that the success of reductionistic approaches to
rationalize and predict metabolism have often been limited.
Although recent theoretical advances, e.g., in the frame-
work of cybernetic modeling (Varner and Ramkrishna,
1999), have significantly extended predictive capabilities,
we are far from understanding all principles governing
metabolic regulation. The development of methods for
experimental assessment of a bioreaction networks
response to changes in growth conditions or genetic
manipulations thus plays a pivotal role for bioprocess
optimization. Methods for unravelling the network topol-
ogy and the in vivo flux distribution are of primary interest:
The topology defines the limits of the production capacity
of a given network, and the fluxes represent a final balanced
manifestation of all cellular components connected to
metabolic regulation.

This article outlines a novel approach that allows both a
comprehensive characterization of a network topology and
the monitoring of metabolic flux distributions. It is based on
biosynthetically directed fractional (BDF) 13C labeling of
the proteinogenic amino acids, which is achieved by feeding
a mixture of uniformly 13C-labeled ([U-13C]-labeled) and
unlabeled carbon source molecules into a bioreaction
network (Senn et al., 1989; Neri et al., 1989; Wu(cid:24) thrich et al.,
1992; Szyperski et al., 1992). When employed in conjunction
with 2D [ 13C, 1H]-correlation NMR spectroscopy for

with 250 [U-13C]-labeled glucose and 75 0 glucose containing 13C at natural abundance as the sole carbon source (A). 13C and 12C nuclei are repre-
sented by red and green dots, respectively. In (B) and (C), carbon(cid:21)carbon connectivities that were not cleaved due the action of metabolism are indicated
by the same bold lines as the bonds of glucose in (A), while covalent bonds formed during amino acid biosynthesis are depicted with thin lines. Asp has
been chosen as an example. Intact connectivities detectable by NMR (see text) are labeled with an asterisk. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms of glucose and
aspartate are depicted as grey dots in (A) and (C), respectively. Since Asp is derived from oxaloacetate, such analysis allows one to quantitate the supply
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Szyperski, 1995).

amino acids, BDF 13C labeling yields a detailed picture of
the breakdown of precursor molecules in the bioreaction
network under consideration (Szyperski, 1995). This
enables the identification of active biochemical pathways
(Szyperski, 1995; Sauer et al., 1997; Hochuli et al., 1999),
the determination of flux ratios, and the semi-quantitative
assessment of exchange fluxes (Szyperski, 1995; Szyperski et
al., 1996; Sauer et al., 1997; Szyperski, 1998; Fiaux et al.,
1999; Sauer et al., 1999). Clearly, limitations of this approach
occur in case two alternative pathways operate according
to the same carbon(cid:21)carbon bond rearrangements. For
example,
and Entner(cid:21)Doudoroff pathway
generate equally 13C-labeled C3 units when feeding glucose
as the sole carbon source, and may thus not be dis-
tinguished (Szyperski, 1995).

METHODS

Biosynthetically Directed Fractional (BDF) 13C Labeling:

The Basic Principle
To gain insight into the action of metabolism, [U-13C]
molecules and(cid:18)or fragments thereof must be diluted
with either nonenriched endogeneous pools, i.e., intracel-
lular metabolites, or nonenriched exogeneous pools, i.e.,
carbon source molecules provided in the growth medium
(Szyperski, 1998). This allows one to trace conserved
13C(cid:21)13C connectivities in the metabolic network. In par-
ticular, BDF 13C labeling employed with a minimal medium
containing a mixture of [U-13C] and unlabeled carbon
source molecules ensures that the metabolic dilution of
[U-13C] fragments is entirely determined by the composi-

tion of the minimal medium (Fig. 1; see also Szyperski,
1998). This yields a uniform 13C enrichment for all carbon
positions. Hence, when 13C NMR spectroscopy is used to
analyze the labeling pattern, the 13C(cid:21)13C spin(cid:21)spin scalar
coupling fine structure becomes the key observable that
provides the relative abundance of 13C-isotope isomers
(isotopomers). These are directly linked to the extent to
which a certain carbon atom is attached to carbons
stemming from the same source molecule.

Efficient Analysis of 13C(cid:21)13C Scalar Coupling Fine Structures:

2D [ 13C, 1H] -Correlation NMR Spectroscopy

2D heteronuclear single-quantum coherence [ 13C, 1H]-
correlation NMR spectroscopy (2D [ 13C,1H]-COSY;
Bodenhausen and Ruben, 1980) offers the most sensitive
approach to assess the 13C(cid:21)13C spin(cid:21)spin scalar coupling
fine structures: it is about five times more sensitive than
standard 1D 13C NMR spectroscopy performed with insen-
sitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer (INEPT)
(Ernst et al., 1987; for a recent review see Szyperski, 1998).
Moreover, the two-dimensional dispersion of 13C resonan-
ces enables one to analyze mixtures of metabolites without
prior separation of the components: the 13C resonances of
the amino acid mixture would overlap in 1D 13C NMR
spectra (Fig. 2).

Beyond 13C Isotopomer Analysis: Tracing Carbon(cid:21)Carbon

Connectivities in a Bioreaction Network

To elucidate the interconversion of source molecules that
are fed into the bioreaction network into the metabolic
precursors, the quantitative analysis of the 13C fine struc-
tures must eventually unravel to which extent a certain
carbon atom has neighboring carbons that originate from
the same source molecule of glucose. This can be accom-
plished using a system of probabilistic equations (Szyperski,
1995) that allows calculation of the expected 13C scalar
coupling fine structure for a given intact fragment (being
defined as a contiguous carbon fragment originating from a
single source molecule). The calculated multiplet patterns
take into account the background from the natural 13C
isotope abundance in the nonenriched source molecules, as
well as the statistical recombination of [U-13C] fragments
due to finite dilution. Subsequently, the observed 13C scalar
coupling fine structure is decomposed according to the fine
structures calculated for all possibly occurring intact
fragments, thus yielding their relative abundance. Even-
tually, sums of such abundances represent the fraction of a
given carbon(cid:21)carbon connectivity that was cleaved due to
the action of metabolism. This allows one to selectively
trace such connectivities in the bioreaction network (Fig. 3).

Cellular Biomass: A Readily Accessible Storage Device for

13C-Labeled Metabolites

An indirect approach to unravelling the labeling pattern
of
intermediary metabolites exploits the fact that their
isotopomeric composition determines the labeling of the
anabolic products generated by primary metabolism, i.e.,
amino acids, nucleosides, or secondary metabolites [for
recent reviews see Szyperski (1998) and references therein].
Analysis of these products, in conjunction with the mapping
of their carbon skeletons to those of the intermediates (see
Fig. 6 in Szyperski, 1998), thus enables the determination of
13C-labeling patterns of the intermediates. The richest
source of information is the proteinogenic amino acids,
which are linked to eight intermediates favorably spread
over the network of central carbon metabolism (Stryer,
1995; Szyperski, 1995). Consequently, several major biosyn-
thetic pathways can be analyzed in a single experiment. A
major advantage of this indirect, biomass-oriented approach
emerges when amino acids are derived from cellular protein,
which represents about 550 of the biomass of an average
Escherichia coli cell (Neidhardt et al., 1996) The protein
essentially acts as a large storage device in which the label-
ing patterns of the intermediates accumulate during cellular
growth, and direct acid hydrolysis of the biomass allows one
to readily extract the labeling information. This indirect
avenue
investigation of glycolysis, pyruvate
metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pentose
phosphate pathway, which is complemented by the analysis
of C1 metabolism via serine and glycine (Szyperski, 1995),
results in a sensitivity enhancement, i.e., higher yields of
molecules carrying the informative 13C-labeling patterns, by
three orders of magnitude or more (Szyperski, 1998).
Finally, it is also of outstanding practical importance for
NMR spectroscopic analyses that the proteinogenic amino
shift dispersion
acids exhibit
(Wu(cid:24) thrich, 1976). This ensures that strong 13C(cid:21)13C scalar
coupling effects do not have to be considered for data inter-
pretation when using a modern high-field NMR spec-
trometer (Szyperski, 1995).

Two Targets of a Single Experiment: Network Topology and

Once the observed fine structures have been translated
into fragment abundances (Fig. 3), the breakdown of the
carbon skeleton of the source molecule can be interpreted.
This allows the identification of the metabolic pathways
that are activated under the physiological conditions of the
experiment (see Selected Applications), as well as the
derivation of ratios of metabolic fluxes (Fig. 4). The data
also allow the identification of irreversible reaction steps in
the bioreaction network and semi-quantitative assessment

FIG. 3. Determination of relative abundances of carbon(cid:21)carbon connectivities from the 13C(cid:21)13C scalar coupling fine structure. (A) Integration of
the fine structure yields the relative intensities of the multiplet components, and thus the relative abundance of the corresponding isotopomers (shown
on right). Is, Id, Id* , and Idd indicate the relative intensities of the singlet, a doublet split by a small one-bond scalar coupling, a doublet* split by a large
one-bond scalar coupling, and a corresponding doublet of doublets. As an example, the fine structure detected for the :-carbon of Asp is shown (see also
Fig. 2). (B) The relative abundances of intact carbon fragments arising from a single source molecule of glucose are calculated using a system of
probabilistic equations (Szyperski, 1995). Connectivities arising from a single source molecule are depicted in bold. In analogy to the notation for the
multiplets, the values f (1), f (2), f (2*), and f (3) denote the fraction of Asp molecules that contain, respectively, an :-carbon without neighbor from the same

(C) When focusing on a certain carbon(cid:21)carbon connectivity, e.g., the C:(cid:21)C; connectivity in Asp, sums of relative abundances are calculated to obtain
the corresponding abundance f (C:(cid:21)C;)[Asp]. Since the same value must be obtained when the ;-carbon is analyzed (see text), we obtain that

of exchange reactions (Szyperski, 1995; Szyperski et al.,
1996; Sauer et al., 1997; Szyperski, 1998). Since the resulting
flux ratios provide detailed insights into the in vivo flux dis-
tribution, we have proposed the term metabolic flux ratio
(METAFoR) analysis (Sauer et al., 1999).

Computer-Aided Data Analysis: The Program FCAL

Since 45 13C(cid:21)13C scalar coupling fine structures extracted
from 2D [ 13C, 1H]-COSY have to be evaluated for each
BDF 13C-labeled sample (for a visual
impression, see

The NMR data provide the fractions of the total pool of molecules of

b. Provided that these fluxes, as well as the efflux &a+&b , are irreversible,
the flux ratios are identical to the ratios of the corresponding fractions.

for

puter support for the data analysis. To meet this objective,
we have implemented the new program FCAL (flux-ratios
from correlated amino acid 13C-labelling patterns). First,
FCAL (Fig. 5) performs a nonlinear least-squares fit of the
parameters describing a cross peak in 2D [ 13C, 1H]-COSY
(i.e., 13C and 1H chemical shifts, 13C(cid:21)13C scalar couplings,
volumes and linewidths of the multiplet components, and
13C isotope effects on the 13C chemical shifts) to the
experimental data. Suitable starting values
these
parameters are retrieved from a library that has been
generated from 2D [ 13C, 1H]-COSY spectra recorded with
a very high signal-to-noise ratio at the standardized NMR
measurement conditions employed for routine analyses.
Subsequently, the peak volumes are translated into relative
abundances of intact fragments (Szyperski, 1998), which are
checked for self-consistency. For example,
the relative
abundance of C:(cid:21)C; connectivities must be equal when
extracted from either the C: or the C; signal (Fig. 3).
Moreover, the abundances must agree with the assumed
bioreaction network. Finally, FCAL calculates metabolic
flux ratios (Szyperski, 1995; Szyperski et al., 1996; Sauer et
al., 1997; Szyperski, 1998; Sauer et al., 1999), and the
Gaussian law of error propagation is employed to estimate
the experimental uncertainties.

SELECTED APPLICATIONS

Assessing the Bioreaction Network Topology: A Split Pathway

for Amino Acid Biosynthesis in a Halophilic Archaeon

As indicated above, knowledge of the network of active
biochemical pathways is a prerequisite to monitor in vivo
fluxes. We identified the reactions catalyzed by the malic
enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in Bacillus
subtilis, which were previously considered to be inactive
under the growth conditions chosen for the particular
experiment (Sauer et al., 1997). These findings pointed out
that despite the large body of data available for model
microbes such as E. coli (Neidhardt et al., 1996) or B. sub-
tilis (Sonenshein et al., 1993), a direct experimental assess-
ment of the network topology is often required to derive an
appropriate metabolic model. This point has to be stressed
further when approaching much less well-characterized
organisms, e.g., thermophilic or halophilic archaea living
under extreme environmental conditions. Due to their
unique metabolism (Davis, 1998), these species are of high
potential interest for applications in biotechnology.

As an illustration, we sketch here selected results
obtained when studying the amino acid biosynthesis in the
halophilic archaeon Haloarcula hispanica (Hochuli et al.,
1999; Fig. 6. BDF 13C labeling was achieved by growing the
cells in a minimal medium containing a mixture of 900

Szyperski et al.

unlabeled and 100 [U(cid:21)13C]-labeled glycerol as the sole
carbon source in a batch culture, and the biomass was har-
vested at the end of the exponential growth phase. The
experimental data revealed that most amino acids were syn-
thesized according to pathways commonly found in eucarya
and bacteria. In contrast, analysis of the 13C(cid:21)13C scalar
coupling fine structure detected for the :-carbon of Ile
strongly suggested that
the so-called threonine and
pyruvate pathways for isoleucine biosynthesis operate in
a split fashion (Fig. 6). This hypothesis has subsequently
been confirmed by a 13C-labeling experiment using uniformly
13C-labeled threonine (Hochuli et al., 1999). Intriguingly,
neither the threonine pathway nor a split pathway for
amino acid biosynthesis in general have previously been
described for archaea. Moreover, the quantitative analysis
also provides the flux ratio through the threonine and
pyruvate pathways;
isoleucine was
synthesized via the threonine and pyruvate pathways,
respectively.

conditions

We applied METAFoR analysis

to several, partly
metabolically engineered E. coli strains under various
(Sauer et al., 1999). This
environmental
endeavor required the analysis of a large number of BDF
13C-labeled samples. Figure 7 shows results obtained for
wild-type E. coli cells grown either under carbon or nitrogen
limitation (Fig. 7), which represent two largely different
bioenergetic regimes. Most strikingly, METAFoR analysis
revealed that an almost twofold-higher fraction of oxaloace-
tate molecules were derived from phosphoenolpyruvate in
the nitrogen-limited case. Hence,
the anaplerotic car-
boxylase reaction (Stryer, 1995) appears to become the
dominant pathway for oxaloacetate generation in E. coli
cells under nitrogen deprivation. Since the flux ratios, or
bounds thereof, that were derived for the pentose phosphate
pathway are rather similar in the two regimes, the data
suggest that the cells respond primarily by adapting the
regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
