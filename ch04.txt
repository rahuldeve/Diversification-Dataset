CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

KEY POINTS
• The transmission media that are used to convey information can be classified as guided or unguided. Guided media provide a physical path along
which the signals are propagated; these include twisted pair, coaxial cable,
and optical fiber. Unguided media employ an antenna for transmitting
through air, vacuum, or water.
• Traditionally, twisted pair has been the workhorse for communications of
all sorts. Higher data rates over longer distances can be achieved with coaxial cable, and so coaxial cable has often been used for high-speed local area
network and for high-capacity long-distance trunk applications. However,
the tremendous capacity of optical fiber has made that medium more attractive than coaxial cable, and thus optical fiber has taken over much of the
market for high-speed LANs and for long-distance applications.
• Unguided transmission techniques commonly used for information communications include broadcast radio, terrestrial microwave, and satellite.
Infrared transmission is used in some LAN applications.
In a data transmission system, the transmission medium is the physical path between
transmitter and receiver. Recall from Chapter 3 that for guided media, electromagnetic waves are guided along a solid medium, such as copper twisted pair, copper
coaxial cable, and optical fiber. For unguided media, wireless transmission occurs
through the atmosphere, outer space, or water.
The characteristics and quality of a data transmission are determined both by
the characteristics of the medium and the characteristics of the signal. In the case of
guided media, the medium itself is more important in determining the limitations of
transmission.
For unguided media, the bandwidth of the signal produced by the transmitting
antenna is more important than the medium in determining transmission characteristics. One key property of signals transmitted by antenna is directionality. In general, signals at lower frequencies are omnidirectional; that is, the signal propagates in
all directions from the antenna. At higher frequencies, it is possible to focus the signal into a directional beam.
In considering the design of data transmission systems, key concerns are data
rate and distance: the greater the data rate and distance the better. A number of design factors relating to the transmission medium and the signal determine the data
rate and distance:
• Bandwidth: All other factors remaining constant, the greater the bandwidth
of a signal, the higher the data rate that can be achieved.
• Transmission impairments: Impairments, such as attenuation, limit the distance. For guided media, twisted pair generally suffers more impairment than
coaxial cable, which in turn suffers more than optical fiber.
• Interference: Interference from competing signals in overlapping frequency
bands can distort or wipe out a signal. Interference is of particular concern for
unguided media but is also a problem with guided media. For guided media,

Electromagnetic Spectrum for Telecommunications

interference can be caused by emanations from nearby cables. For example,
twisted pairs are often bundled together and conduits often carry multiple
cables. Interference can also be experienced from unguided transmissions.
Proper shielding of a guided medium can minimize this problem.
• Number of receivers: A guided medium can be used to construct a point-topoint link or a shared link with multiple attachments. In the latter case, each
attachment introduces some attenuation and distortion on the line, limiting
distance and/or data rate.
Figure 4.1 depicts the electromagnetic spectrum and indicates the frequencies
at which various guided media and unguided transmission techniques operate. In
this chapter we examine these guided and unguided alternatives. In all cases, we describe the systems physically, briefly discuss applications, and summarize key transmission characteristics.

4.1 GUIDED TRANSMISSION MEDIA
For guided transmission media, the transmission capacity, in terms of either data
rate or bandwidth, depends critically on the distance and on whether the medium is
point-to-point or multipoint. Table 4.1 indicates the characteristics typical for the
common guided media for long-distance point-to-point applications; we defer a discussion of the use of these media for multipoint LANs to Part Four.

The three guided media commonly used for data transmission are twisted pair,
coaxial cable, and optical fiber (Figure 4.2). We examine each of these in turn.

Twisted Pair
The least expensive and most widely used guided transmission medium is twisted pair.
Physical Description
A twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern. A wire pair acts as a single communication link. Typically, a number of
these pairs are bundled together into a cable by wrapping them in a tough protective sheath. Over longer distances, cables may contain hundreds of pairs. The twisting tends to decrease the crosstalk interference between adjacent pairs in a cable.
Neighboring pairs in a bundle typically have somewhat different twist lengths to reduce the crosstalk interference. On long-distance links, the twist length typically
varies from 5 to 15 cm. The wires in a pair have thicknesses of from 0.4 to 0.9 mm.
Applications
By far the most common transmission medium for both analog and digital signals is twisted pair. It is the most commonly used medium in the telephone network
and is the workhorse for communications within buildings.
In the telephone system, individual residential telephone sets are connected to
the local telephone exchange, or “end office,” by twisted-pair wire. These are referred to as subscriber loops. Within an office building, each telephone is also connected to a twisted pair, which goes to the in-house private branch exchange (PBX)
system or to a Centrex facility at the end office. These twisted-pair installations were
designed to support voice traffic using analog signaling. However, by means of a
modem, these facilities can handle digital data traffic at modest data rates.
Twisted pair is also the most common medium used for digital signaling. For
connections to a digital data switch or digital PBX within a building, a data rate of
64 kbps is common. Twisted pair is also commonly used within a building for local
area networks supporting personal computers. Data rates for such products are
typically in the neighborhood of 10 Mbps. However, twisted-pair networks with data
rates of to 1 Gbps have been developed, although these are quite limited in terms of

the number of devices and geographic scope of the network. For long-distance applications, twisted pair can be used at data rates of 4 Mbps or more.
Twisted pair is much less expensive than the other commonly used guided
transmission media (coaxial cable, optical fiber) and is easier to work with.
Transmission Characteristics
Twisted pair may be used to transmit both analog and digital transmission. For
analog signals, amplifiers are required about every 5 to 6 km. For digital transmission (using either analog or digital signals), repeaters are required every 2 or 3 km.
Compared to other commonly used guided transmission media (coaxial cable,
optical fiber), twisted pair is limited in distance, bandwidth, and data rate. As

Attenuation of Typical Guided Media

Figure 4.3a shows, the attenuation for twisted pair is a very strong function of frequency. Other impairments are also severe for twisted pair. The medium is quite susceptible to interference and noise because of its easy coupling with electromagnetic
fields. For example, a wire run parallel to an ac power line will pick up 60-Hz energy.
Impulse noise also easily intrudes into twisted pair. Several measures are taken to
reduce impairments. Shielding the wire with metallic braid or sheathing reduces interference. The twisting of the wire reduces low-frequency interference, and the use
of different twist lengths in adjacent pairs reduces crosstalk.
For point-to-point analog signaling, a bandwidth of up to about 1 MHz is possible. This accommodates a number of voice channels. For long-distance digital
point-to-point signaling, data rates of up to a few Mbps are possible; for very short
distances, data rates of up to 1 Gbps have been achieved in commercially available
products.
Unshielded and Shielded Twisted Pair
Twisted pair comes in two varieties: unshielded and shielded. Unshielded
twisted pair (UTP) is ordinary telephone wire. Office buildings, by universal practice, are prewired with excess unshielded twisted pair, more than is needed for simple telephone support. This is the least expensive of all the transmission media
commonly used for local area networks and is easy to work with and easy to install.
Unshielded twisted pair is subject to external electromagnetic interference, including interference from nearby twisted pair and from noise generated in the

environment. A way to improve the characteristics of this medium is to shield the
twisted pair with a metallic braid or sheathing that reduces interference. This shielded twisted pair (STP) provides better performance at higher data rates. However, it
is more expensive and more difficult to work with than unshielded twisted pair.
Category 3 and Category 5 UTP
Most office buildings are prewired with a type of 100-ohm twisted pair cable
commonly referred to as voice grade. Because voice-grade twisted pair is already installed, it is an attractive alternative for use as a LAN medium. Unfortunately, the
data rates and distances achievable with voice-grade twisted pair are limited.
In 1991, the Electronic Industries Association published standard EIA-568,
Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard, which specifies the use
of voice-grade unshielded twisted pair as well as shielded twisted pair for in-building
data applications. At that time, the specification was felt to be adequate for the range
of frequencies and data rates found in office environments. Up to that time, the principal interest for LAN designs was in the range of data rates from 1 Mbps to 16 Mbps.
Subsequently, as users migrated to higher-performance workstations and applications,
there was increasing interest in providing LANs that could operate up to 100 Mbps
over inexpensive cable. In response to this need, EIA-568-A was issued in 1995. The
new standard reflects advances in cable and connector design and test methods. It covers 150-ohm shielded twisted pair and 100-ohm unshielded twisted pair.
EIA-568-A recognizes three categories of UTP cabling:
• Category 3: UTP cables and associated connecting hardware whose transmission characteristics are specified up to 16 MHz
• Category 4: UTP cables and associated connecting hardware whose transmission characteristics are specified up to 20 MHz
• Category 5: UTP cables and associated connecting hardware whose transmission characteristics are specified up to 100 MHz
Of these, it is Category 3 and Category 5 cable that have received the most attention for LAN applications. Category 3 corresponds to the voice-grade cable found
in abundance in most office buildings. Over limited distances, and with proper design,
data rates of up to 16 Mbps should be achievable with Category 3. Category 5 is a
data-grade cable that is becoming increasingly common for preinstallation in new
office buildings. Over limited distances, and with proper design, data rates of up to
100 Mbps should be achievable with Category 5.
A key difference between Category 3 and Category 5 cable is the number of
twists in the cable per unit distance. Category 5 is much more tightly twisted, with a
typical twist length of 0.6 to 0.85 cm, compared to 7.5 to 10 cm for Category 3. The
tighter twisting of Category 5 is more expensive but provides much better performance than Category 3.
Table 4.2 summarizes the performance of Category 3 and 5 UTP, as well as the
STP specified in EIA-568-A. The first parameter used for comparison, attenuation,
is fairly straightforward. The strength of a signal falls off with distance over any
transmission medium. For guided media attenuation is generally exponential and
therefore is typically expressed as a constant number of decibels per unit distance.

Near-end crosstalk as it applies to twisted pair wiring systems is the coupling
of the signal from one pair of conductors to another pair. These conductors may be
the metal pins in a connector or wire pairs in a cable. The near end refers to coupling
that takes place when the transmit signal entering the link couples back to the
receiving conductor pair at that same end of the link (i.e., the near transmitted signal is picked up by the near receive pair).
Since the publication of EIA-568-A, there has been ongoing work on the development of standards for premises cabling, driven by two issues. First, the Gigabit
Ethernet specification requires the definition of parameters that are not specified
completely in any published cabling standard. Second, there is a desire to specify cabling performance to higher levels, namely Enhanced Category 5 (Cat 5E), Category 6, and Category 7. Tables 4.3 and 4.4 summarize these new cabling schemes and
compare them to the existing standards.

Coaxial Cable
Physical Description
Coaxial cable, like twisted pair, consists of two conductors, but is constructed
differently to permit it to operate over a wider range of frequencies. It consists of a
hollow outer cylindrical conductor that surrounds a single inner wire conductor (Figure 4.2b). The inner conductor is held in place by either regularly spaced insulating

rings or a solid dielectric material. The outer conductor is covered with a jacket or
shield. A single coaxial cable has a diameter of from 1 to 2.5 cm. Coaxial cable can be
used over longer distances and support more stations on a shared line than twisted
pair.
Applications
Coaxial cable is perhaps the most versatile transmission medium and is enjoying widespread use in a wide variety of applications. The most important of these are
•
•
•
•

Television distribution
Long-distance telephone transmission
Short-run computer system links
Local area networks

Coaxial cable is widely used as a means of distributing TV signals to individual
homes—cable TV. From its modest beginnings as Community Antenna Television
(CATV), designed to provide service to remote areas, cable TV reaches almost as
many homes and offices as the telephone. A cable TV system can carry dozens or
even hundreds of TV channels at ranges up to a few tens of kilometers.
Coaxial cable has traditionally been an important part of the long-distance
telephone network. Today, it faces increasing competition from optical fiber, terrestrial microwave, and satellite. Using frequency division multiplexing (FDM, see
Chapter 8), a coaxial cable can carry over 10,000 voice channels simultaneously.
Coaxial cable is also commonly used for short-range connections between devices. Using digital signaling, coaxial cable can be used to provide high-speed I/O
channels on computer systems.
Transmission Characteristics
Coaxial cable is used to transmit both analog and digital signals. As can be seen
from Figure 4.3b, coaxial cable has frequency characteristics that are superior to those
of twisted pair, and can hence be used effectively at higher frequencies and data rates.
Because of its shielded, concentric construction, coaxial cable is much less susceptible
to interference and crosstalk than twisted pair. The principal constraints on performance are attenuation, thermal noise, and intermodulation noise.The latter is present
only when several channels (FDM) or frequency bands are in use on the cable.
For long-distance transmission of analog signals, amplifiers are needed every
few kilometers, with closer spacing required if higher frequencies are used. The usable spectrum for analog signaling extends to about 500 MHz. For digital signaling,
repeaters are needed every kilometer or so, with closer spacing needed for higher
data rates.

Optical Fiber
Physical Description
An optical fiber is a thin (2 to 125 m), flexible medium capable of guiding an
optical ray. Various glasses and plastics can be used to make optical fibers. The lowest losses have been obtained using fibers of ultrapure fused silica. Ultrapure fiber is

STAL-04-093-128.I

Page 103

4.1 / GUIDED TRANSMISSION MEDIA

103

difficult to manufacture; higher-loss multicomponent glass fibers are more economical and still provide good performance. Plastic fiber is even less costly and can be
used for short-haul links, for which moderately high losses are acceptable.
An optical fiber cable has a cylindrical shape and consists of three concentric
sections: the core, the cladding, and the jacket (Figure 4.2c). The core is the innermost section and consists of one or more very thin strands, or fibers, made of glass or
plastic; the core has a diameter in the range of 8 to 100 m. Each fiber is surrounded by its own cladding, a glass or plastic coating that has optical properties different
from those of the core. The interface between the core and cladding acts as a reflector to confine light that would otherwise escape the core. The outermost layer, surrounding one or a bundle of cladded fibers, is the jacket. The jacket is composed of
plastic and other material layered to protect against moisture, abrasion, crushing,
and other environmental dangers.
Applications
One of the most significant technological breakthroughs in data transmission
has been the development of practical fiber optic communications systems. Optical
fiber already enjoys considerable use in long-distance telecommunications, and its
use in military applications is growing. The continuing improvements in performance and decline in prices, together with the inherent advantages of optical fiber,
have made it increasingly attractive for local area networking. The following characteristics distinguish optical fiber from twisted pair or coaxial cable:
• Greater capacity: The potential bandwidth, and hence data rate, of optical
fiber is immense; data rates of hundreds of Gbps over tens of kilometers have
been demonstrated. Compare this to the practical maximum of hundreds of
Mbps over about 1 km for coaxial cable and just a few Mbps over 1 km or up
to 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps over a few tens of meters for twisted pair.
• Smaller size and lighter weight: Optical fibers are considerably thinner than
coaxial cable or bundled twisted-pair cable—at least an order of magnitude
thinner for comparable information transmission capacity. For cramped conduits in buildings and underground along public rights-of-way, the advantage
of small size is considerable. The corresponding reduction in weight reduces
structural support requirements.
• Lower attenuation: Attenuation is significantly lower for optical fiber than for
coaxial cable or twisted pair (Figure 4.3c) and is constant over a wide range.
• Electromagnetic isolation: Optical fiber systems are not affected by external
electromagnetic fields. Thus the system is not vulnerable to interference,
impulse noise, or crosstalk. By the same token, fibers do not radiate energy, so
there is little interference with other equipment and there is a high degree of
security from eavesdropping. In addition, fiber is inherently difficult to tap.
• Greater repeater spacing: Fewer repeaters mean lower cost and fewer sources
of error. The performance of optical fiber systems from this point of view has
been steadily improving. Repeater spacing in the tens of kilometers for optical fiber is common, and repeater spacings of hundreds of kilometers have
been demonstrated. Coaxial and twisted-pair systems generally have repeaters
every few kilometers.

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

Five basic categories of application have become important for optical fiber:
•
•
•
•
•

Long-haul trunks
Metropolitan trunks
Rural exchange trunks
Subscriber loops
Local area networks

Long-haul fiber transmission is becoming increasingly common in the telephone network. Long-haul routes average about 1500 km in length and offer high
capacity (typically 20,000 to 60,000 voice channels). These systems compete economically with microwave and have so underpriced coaxial cable in many developed
countries that coaxial cable is rapidly being phased out of the telephone network in
such countries. Undersea optical fiber cables have also enjoyed increasing use.
Metropolitan trunking circuits have an average length of 12 km and may have
as many as 100,000 voice channels in a trunk group. Most facilities are installed in
underground conduits and are repeaterless, joining telephone exchanges in a metropolitan or city area. Included in this category are routes that link long-haul microwave facilities that terminate at a city perimeter to the main telephone exchange
building downtown.
Rural exchange trunks have circuit lengths ranging from 40 to 160 km and link
towns and villages. In the United States, they often connect the exchanges of different telephone companies. Most of these systems have fewer than 5000 voice channels. The technology used in these applications competes with microwave facilities.
Subscriber loop circuits are fibers that run directly from the central exchange
to a subscriber. These facilities are beginning to displace twisted pair and coaxial
cable links as the telephone networks evolve into full-service networks capable of
handling not only voice and data, but also image and video. The initial penetration
of optical fiber in this application is for the business subscriber, but fiber transmission into the home will soon begin to appear.
A final important application of optical fiber is for local area networks. Standards have been developed and products introduced for optical fiber networks that
have a total capacity of 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps and can support hundreds or even
thousands of stations in a large office building or a complex of buildings.
The advantages of optical fiber over twisted pair and coaxial cable become
more compelling as the demand for all types of information (voice, data, image,
video) increases.
Transmission Characteristics
Optical fiber transmits a signal-encoded beam of light by means of total internal reflection. Total internal reflection can occur in any transparent medium that has
a higher index of refraction than the surrounding medium. In effect, the optical fiber
acts as a waveguide for frequencies in the range of about 1014 to 1015 Hertz; this covers portions of the infrared and visible spectra.
Figure 4.4 shows the principle of optical fiber transmission. Light from a
source enters the cylindrical glass or plastic core. Rays at shallow angles are reflected and propagated along the fiber; other rays are absorbed by the surrounding

material. This form of propagation is called step-index multimode, referring to the
variety of angles that will reflect. With multimode transmission, multiple propagation paths exist, each with a different path length and hence time to traverse the
fiber. This causes signal elements (light pulses) to spread out in time, which limits
the rate at which data can be accurately received. Put another way, the need to leave
spacing between the pulses limits data rate. This type of fiber is best suited for transmission over very short distances. When the fiber core radius is reduced, fewer angles will reflect. By reducing the radius of the core to the order of a wavelength, only
a single angle or mode can pass: the axial ray. This single-mode propagation provides superior performance for the following reason. Because there is a single transmission path with single-mode transmission, the distortion found in multimode
cannot occur. Single-mode is typically used for long-distance applications, including
telephone and cable television. Finally, by varying the index of refraction of the
core, a third type of transmission, known as graded-index multimode, is possible.
This type is intermediate between the other two in characteristics. The higher refractive index (discussed subsequently) at the center makes the light rays moving
down the axis advance more slowly than those near the cladding. Rather than zigzagging off the cladding, light in the core curves helically because of the graded
index, reducing its travel distance. The shortened path and higher speed allows light
at the periphery to arrive at a receiver at about the same time as the straight rays in
the core axis. Graded-index fibers are often used in local area networks.
Two different types of light source are used in fiber optic systems: the lightemitting diode (LED) and the injection laser diode (ILD). Both are semiconductor
devices that emit a beam of light when a voltage is applied. The LED is less costly,
operates over a greater temperature range, and has a longer operational life. The
ILD, which operates on the laser principle, is more efficient and can sustain greater
data rates.

There is a relationship among the wavelength employed, the type of transmission, and the achievable data rate. Both single mode and multimode can support
several different wavelengths of light and can employ laser or LED light sources. In
optical fiber, based on the attenuation characteristics of the medium and on properties of light sources and receivers, four transmission windows are appropriate,
shown in Table 4.5.
Note the tremendous bandwidths available. For the four windows, the respective bandwidths are 33 THz, 12 THz, 4 THz, and 7 THz. This is several orders of magnitude greater than the bandwidth available in the radio-frequency spectrum.
One confusing aspect of reported attenuation figures for fiber optic transmission is that, invariably, fiber optic performance is specified in terms of wavelength rather than frequency. The wavelengths that appear in graphs and tables
are the wavelengths corresponding to transmission in a vacuum. However, on the
fiber, the velocity of propagation is less than the speed of light in a vacuum (c); the
result is that although the frequency of the signal is unchanged, the wavelength is
changed.
Example 4.1 For a wavelength in vacuum of 1550 nm, the corresponding frequency is f = c>l = 13 * 1082>11550 * 10-92 = 193.4 * 1012 = 193.4 THz.
For a typical single mode fiber, the velocity of propagation is approximately
v = 2.04 * 108. In this case, a frequency of 193.4 THz corresponds to a wavelength of l = v>f = 12.04 * 1082>1193.4 * 10122 = 1055 nm. Therefore, on
this fiber, when a wavelength of 1550 nm is cited, the actual wavelength on the
fiber is 1055 nm.
The four transmission windows are in the infrared portion of the frequency
spectrum, below the visible-light portion, which is 400 to 700 nm. The loss is lower
at higher wavelengths, allowing greater data rates over longer distances. Many local
applications today use 850-nm LED light sources. Although this combination is relatively inexpensive, it is generally limited to data rates under 100 Mbps and distances
of a few kilometers. To achieve higher data rates and longer distances, a 1300-nm
LED or laser source is needed. The highest data rates and longest distances require
1500-nm laser sources.

Figure 4.3c shows attenuation versus wavelength for a typical optical fiber. The
unusual shape of the curve is due to the combination of a variety of factors that contribute to attenuation. The two most important of these are absorption and scattering. In this context, the term scattering refers to the change in direction of light rays
after they strike small particles or impurities in the medium.

4.2 WIRELESS TRANSMISSION
Three general ranges of frequencies are of interest in our discussion of wireless
transmission. Frequencies in the range of about 1 GHz (gigahertz = 109 Hertz) to
40 GHz are referred to as microwave frequencies. At these frequencies, highly directional beams are possible, and microwave is quite suitable for point-to-point
transmission. Microwave is also used for satellite communications. Frequencies in
the range of 30 MHz to 1 GHz are suitable for omnidirectional applications. We
refer to this range as the radio range.
Another important frequency range, for local applications, is the infrared portion of the spectrum. This covers, roughly, from 3 * 1011 to 2 * 1014 Hz. Infrared is
useful to local point-to-point and multipoint applications within confined areas,
such as a single room.
For unguided media, transmission and reception are achieved by means of an
antenna. Before looking at specific categories of wireless transmission, we provide a
brief introduction to antennas.

Antennas
An antenna can be defined as an electrical conductor or system of conductors used
either for radiating electromagnetic energy or for collecting electromagnetic energy. For transmission of a signal, electrical energy from the transmitter is converted
into electromagnetic energy by the antenna and radiated into the surrounding environment (atmosphere, space, water). For reception of a signal, electromagnetic
energy impinging on the antenna is converted into electrical energy and fed into
the receiver.
In two-way communication, the same antenna can be and often is used for
both transmission and reception. This is possible because any antenna transfers energy from the surrounding environment to its input receiver terminals with the same
efficiency that it transfers energy from the output transmitter terminals into the surrounding environment, assuming that the same frequency is used in both directions.
Put another way, antenna characteristics are essentially the same whether an antenna is sending or receiving electromagnetic energy.
An antenna will radiate power in all directions but, typically, does not perform equally well in all directions. A common way to characterize the performance
of an antenna is the radiation pattern, which is a graphical representation of the radiation properties of an antenna as a function of space coordinates. The simplest
pattern is produced by an idealized antenna known as the isotropic antenna. An

STAL-04-093-128.I

10:54 AM

Page 108

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

isotropic antenna is a point in space that radiates power in all directions equally.
The actual radiation pattern for the isotropic antenna is a sphere with the antenna
at the center.
Parabolic Reflective Antenna
An important type of antenna is the parabolic reflective antenna, which is
used in terrestrial microwave and satellite applications. You may recall from your
precollege geometry studies that a parabola is the locus of all points equidistant
from a fixed line and a fixed point not on the line. The fixed point is called the focus
and the fixed line is called the directrix (Figure 4.5a). If a parabola is revolved about
its axis, the surface generated is called a paraboloid. A cross section through the paraboloid parallel to its axis forms a parabola and a cross section perpendicular to the
axis forms a circle. Such surfaces are used in headlights, optical and radio telescopes,
and microwave antennas because of the following property: If a source of electromagnetic energy (or sound) is placed at the focus of the paraboloid, and if the paraboloid is a reflecting surface, then the wave will bounce back in lines parallel to
the axis of the paraboloid; Figure 4.5b shows this effect in cross section. In theory,
this effect creates a parallel beam without dispersion. In practice, there will be some
dispersion, because the source of energy must occupy more than one point. The
larger the diameter of the antenna, the more tightly directional is the beam. On reception, if incoming waves are parallel to the axis of the reflecting paraboloid, the
resulting signal will be concentrated at the focus.

Antenna Gain
Antenna gain is a measure of the directionality of an antenna. Antenna gain is
defined as the power output, in a particular direction, compared to that produced in
any direction by a perfect omnidirectional antenna (isotropic antenna). For example, if an antenna has a gain of 3 dB, that antenna improves upon the isotropic antenna in that direction by 3 dB, or a factor of 2. The increased power radiated in a
given direction is at the expense of other directions. In effect, increased power is radiated in one direction by reducing the power radiated in other directions. It is important to note that antenna gain does not refer to obtaining more output power
than input power but rather to directionality.
A concept related to that of antenna gain is the effective area of an antenna.
The effective area of an antenna is related to the physical size of the antenna and to
its shape. The relationship between antenna gain and effective area is

For example, the effective area of an ideal isotropic antenna is l2>4p, with a
power gain of 1; the effective area of a parabolic antenna with a face area of A is
0.56A, with a power gain of 7A>l2.
Example 4.2 For a parabolic reflective antenna with a diameter of 2 m,
operating at 12 GHz, what is the effective area and the antenna gain? We
have an area of A = pr2 = p and an effective area of A e = 0.56p. The wavelength is l = c>f = 13 * 1082>112 * 1092 = 0.025 m. Then
G = 17A2>l2 = 17 * p2>10.02522 = 35,186
GdB = 45.46 dB

Terrestrial Microwave
Physical Description
The most common type of microwave antenna is the parabolic “dish.” A typical size is about 3 m in diameter. The antenna is fixed rigidly and focuses a narrow
beam to achieve line-of-sight transmission to the receiving antenna. Microwave antennas are usually located at substantial heights above ground level to extend the
range between antennas and to be able to transmit over intervening obstacles. To
achieve long-distance transmission, a series of microwave relay towers is used, and
point-to-point microwave links are strung together over the desired distance.

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

Applications
The primary use for terrestrial microwave systems is in long haul telecommunications service, as an alternative to coaxial cable or optical fiber. The microwave
facility requires far fewer amplifiers or repeaters than coaxial cable over the same
distance but requires line-of-sight transmission. Microwave is commonly used for
both voice and television transmission.
Another increasingly common use of microwave is for short point-to-point
links between buildings. This can be used for closed-circuit TV or as a data link between local area networks. Short-haul microwave can also be used for the so-called
bypass application. A business can establish a microwave link to a long-distance
telecommunications facility in the same city, bypassing the local telephone company.
Another important use of microwave is in cellular systems, examined in
Chapter 14.
Transmission Characteristics
Microwave transmission covers a substantial portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Common frequencies used for transmission are in the range 1 to 40 GHz.
The higher the frequency used, the higher the potential bandwidth and therefore
the higher the potential data rate. Table 4.6 indicates bandwidth and data rate for
some typical systems.
As with any transmission system, a main source of loss is attenuation. For microwave (and radio frequencies), the loss can be expressed as
L = 10 log a

4pd 2
b dB
l

(4.2)

where d is the distance and l is the wavelength, in the same units. Thus, loss varies as
the square of the distance. In contrast, for twisted-pair and coaxial cable, loss varies
exponentially with distance (linear in decibels). Thus repeaters or amplifiers may be
placed farther apart for microwave systems—10 to 100 km is typical. Attenuation is
increased with rainfall. The effects of rainfall become especially noticeable above
10 GHz. Another source of impairment is interference. With the growing popularity
of microwave, transmission areas overlap and interference is always a danger. Thus
the assignment of frequency bands is strictly regulated.
The most common bands for long-haul telecommunications are the 4-GHz to
6-GHz bands. With increasing congestion at these frequencies, the 11-GHz band is

now coming into use. The 12-GHz band is used as a component of cable TV systems.
Microwave links are used to provide TV signals to local CATV installations; the signals are then distributed to individual subscribers via coaxial cable. Higher-frequency
microwave is being used for short point-to-point links between buildings; typically, the
22-GHz band is used. The higher microwave frequencies are less useful for longer distances because of increased attenuation but are quite adequate for shorter distances.
In addition, at the higher frequencies, the antennas are smaller and cheaper.

Satellite Microwave
Physical Description
A communication satellite is, in effect, a microwave relay station. It is used to
link two or more ground-based microwave transmitter/receivers, known as earth
stations, or ground stations. The satellite receives transmissions on one frequency
band (uplink), amplifies or repeats the signal, and transmits it on another frequency
(downlink). A single orbiting satellite will operate on a number of frequency bands,
called transponder channels, or simply transponders.
Figure 4.6 depicts in a general way two common configurations for satellite
communication. In the first, the satellite is being used to provide a point-to-point
link between two distant ground-based antennas. In the second, the satellite provides communications between one ground-based transmitter and a number of
ground-based receivers.
For a communication satellite to function effectively, it is generally required
that it remain stationary with respect to its position over the earth. Otherwise, it
would not be within the line of sight of its earth stations at all times. To remain stationary, the satellite must have a period of rotation equal to the earth’s period of rotation. This match occurs at a height of 35,863 km at the equator.
Two satellites using the same frequency band, if close enough together, will interfere with each other. To avoid this, current standards require a 4° spacing (angular displacement as measured from the earth) in the 4/6-GHz band and a 3° spacing
at 12/14 GHz. Thus the number of possible satellites is quite limited.
Applications
The communication satellite is a technological revolution as important as fiber
optics. Among the most important applications for satellites are the following:
• Television distribution
• Long-distance telephone transmission
• Private business networks
Because of their broadcast nature, satellites are well suited to television distribution and are being used extensively in the United States and throughout the
world for this purpose. In its traditional use, a network provides programming from
a central location. Programs are transmitted to the satellite and then broadcast
down to a number of stations, which then distribute the programs to individual

viewers. One network, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), distributes its television programming almost exclusively by the use of satellite channels. Other commercial networks also make substantial use of satellite, and cable television systems
are receiving an ever-increasing proportion of their programming from satellites.
The most recent application of satellite technology to television distribution is
direct broadcast satellite (DBS), in which satellite video signals are transmitted directly to the home user. The decreasing cost and size of receiving antennas have
made DBS economically feasible, and a number of channels are either already in
service or in the planning stage.
Satellite transmission is also used for point-to-point trunks between telephone
exchange offices in public telephone networks. It is the optimum medium for high-

usage international trunks and is competitive with terrestrial systems for many longdistance intranational links.
Finally, there are a number of business data applications for satellite. The satellite provider can divide the total capacity into a number of channels and lease these
channels to individual business users. A user equipped with the antennas at a number of sites can use a satellite channel for a private network. Traditionally, such applications have been quite expensive and limited to larger organizations with
high-volume requirements. A recent development is the very small aperture terminal (VSAT) system, which provides a low-cost alternative. Figure 4.7 depicts a typical VSAT configuration. A number of subscriber stations are equipped with low-cost
VSAT antennas. Using some discipline, these stations share a satellite transmission
capacity for transmission to a hub station. The hub station can exchange messages
with each of the subscribers and can relay messages between subscribers.
Transmission Characteristics
The optimum frequency range for satellite transmission is in the range 1 to
10 GHz. Below 1 GHz, there is significant noise from natural sources, including
galactic, solar, and atmospheric noise, and human-made interference from various
electronic devices. Above 10 GHz, the signal is severely attenuated by atmospheric
absorption and precipitation.
Most satellites providing point-to-point service today use a frequency bandwidth in the range 5.925 to 6.425 GHz for transmission from earth to satellite (uplink) and a bandwidth in the range 3.7 to 4.2 GHz for transmission from satellite to
earth (downlink). This combination is referred to as the 4/6-GHz band. Note that the
uplink and downlink frequencies differ. For continuous operation without interference, a satellite cannot transmit and receive on the same frequency. Thus signals received from a ground station on one frequency must be transmitted back on another.

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

The 4/6-GHz band is within the optimum zone of 1 to 10 GHz but has become
saturated. Other frequencies in that range are unavailable because of sources of interference operating at those frequencies, usually terrestrial microwave. Therefore,
the 12/14-GHz band has been developed (uplink: 14 to 14.5 GHz; downlink: 11.7 to
12.2 GHz). At this frequency band, attenuation problems must be overcome. However, smaller and cheaper earth-station receivers can be used. It is anticipated that
this band will also saturate, and use is projected for the 20/30-GHz band (uplink:
27.5 to 30.0 GHz; downlink: 17.7 to 20.2 GHz). This band experiences even greater
attenuation problems but will allow greater bandwidth (2500 MHz versus 500 MHz)
and even smaller and cheaper receivers.
Several properties of satellite communication should be noted. First, because
of the long distances involved, there is a propagation delay of about a quarter second from transmission from one earth station to reception by another earth station.
This delay is noticeable in ordinary telephone conversations. It also introduces
problems in the areas of error control and flow control, which we discuss in later
chapters. Second, satellite microwave is inherently a broadcast facility. Many stations can transmit to the satellite, and a transmission from a satellite can be received
by many stations.

Broadcast Radio
Physical Description
The principal difference between broadcast radio and microwave is that the
former is omnidirectional and the latter is directional. Thus broadcast radio does not
require dish-shaped antennas, and the antennas need not be rigidly mounted to a
precise alignment.
Applications
Radio is a general term used to encompass frequencies in the range of 3 kHz to
300 GHz. We are using the informal term broadcast radio to cover the VHF and part
of the UHF band: 30 MHz to 1 GHz. This range covers FM radio and UHF and VHF
television. This range is also used for a number of data networking applications.
Transmission Characteristics
The range 30 MHz to 1 GHz is an effective one for broadcast communications.
Unlike the case for lower-frequency electromagnetic waves, the ionosphere is transparent to radio waves above 30 MHz. Thus transmission is limited to the line of
sight, and distant transmitters will not interfere with each other due to reflection
from the atmosphere. Unlike the higher frequencies of the microwave region,
broadcast radio waves are less sensitive to attenuation from rainfall.
As with microwave, the amount of attenuation due to distance obeys Equa4pd 2
b dB. Because of the longer wavelength, radio waves
tion (4.2), namely 10 log a
l
suffer relatively less attenuation.
A prime source of impairment for broadcast radio waves is multipath interference. Reflection from land, water, and natural or human-made objects can create

STAL-04-093-128.I

115

multiple paths between antennas. This effect is frequently evident when TV reception displays multiple images as an airplane passes by.

Infrared
Infrared communications is achieved using transmitters/receivers (transceivers)
that modulate noncoherent infrared light. Transceivers must be within the line of
sight of each other either directly or via reflection from a light-colored surface such
as the ceiling of a room.
One important difference between infrared and microwave transmission is
that the former does not penetrate walls. Thus the security and interference problems encountered in microwave systems are not present. Furthermore, there is no
frequency allocation issue with infrared, because no licensing is required.

4.3 WIRELESS PROPAGATION
A signal radiated from an antenna travels along one of three routes: ground wave,
sky wave, or line of sight (LOS). Table 4.7 shows in which frequency range each predominates. In this book, we are almost exclusively concerned with LOS communication, but a short overview of each mode is given in this section.

Ground Wave Propagation
Ground wave propagation (Figure 4.8a) more or less follows the contour of the
earth and can propagate considerable distances, well over the visual horizon. This
effect is found in frequencies up to about 2 MHz. Several factors account for the
tendency of electromagnetic wave in this frequency band to follow the earth’s curvature. One factor is that the electromagnetic wave induces a current in the earth’s
surface, the result of which is to slow the wavefront near the earth, causing the wavefront to tilt downward and hence follow the earth’s curvature. Another factor is diffraction, which is a phenomenon having to do with the behavior of electromagnetic
waves in the presence of obstacles.
Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range are scattered by the atmosphere in such a way that they do not penetrate the upper atmosphere.
The best-known example of ground wave communication is AM radio.

Sky Wave Propagation
Sky wave propagation is used for amateur radio, CB radio, and international broadcasts such as BBC and Voice of America. With sky wave propagation, a signal from
an earth-based antenna is reflected from the ionized layer of the upper atmosphere
(ionosphere) back down to earth. Although it appears the wave is reflected from the
ionosphere as if the ionosphere were a hard reflecting surface, the effect is in fact
caused by refraction. Refraction is described subsequently.
A sky wave signal can travel through a number of hops, bouncing back and
forth between the ionosphere and the earth’s surface (Figure 4.8b). With this propagation mode, a signal can be picked up thousands of kilometers from the transmitter.

Wireless Propagation Modes

Line-of-Sight Propagation
Above 30 MHz, neither ground wave nor sky wave propagation modes operate, and
communication must be by line of sight (Figure 4.8c). For satellite communication, a
signal above 30 MHz is not reflected by the ionosphere and therefore a signal can be
transmitted between an earth station and a satellite overhead that is not beyond the

horizon. For ground-based communication, the transmitting and receiving antennas
must be within an effective line of sight of each other. The term effective is used because microwaves are bent or refracted by the atmosphere. The amount and even
the direction of the bend depends on conditions, but generally microwaves are bent
with the curvature of the earth and will therefore propagate farther than the optical
line of sight.
Refraction
Before proceeding, a brief discussion of refraction is warranted. Refraction occurs
because the velocity of an electromagnetic wave is a function of the density of the medium through which it travels. In a vacuum, an electromagnetic wave (such as light or a
radio wave) travels at approximately 3 * 108 m>s. This is the constant, c, commonly referred to as the speed of light, but actually referring to the speed of light in a vacuum.1 In
air, water, glass, and other transparent or partially transparent media, electromagnetic
waves travel at speeds less than c.
When an electromagnetic wave moves from a medium of one density to a medium of another density, its speed changes. The effect is to cause a one-time bending of
the direction of the wave at the boundary between the two media. Moving from a less
dense to a more dense medium, the wave will bend toward the more dense medium.
This phenomenon is easily observed by partially immersing a stick in water.
The index of refraction, or refractive index, of one medium relative to another
is the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction. The
index of refraction is also equal to the ratio of the respective velocities in the two
media. The absolute index of refraction of a medium is calculated in comparison
with that of a vacuum. Refractive index varies with wavelength, so that refractive effects differ for signals with different wavelengths.
Although an abrupt, one-time change in direction occurs as a signal moves
from one medium to another, a continuous, gradual bending of a signal will occur if
it is moving through a medium in which the index of refraction gradually changes.
Under normal propagation conditions, the refractive index of the atmosphere decreases with height so that radio waves travel more slowly near the ground than at
higher altitudes. The result is a slight bending of the radio waves toward the earth.
Optical and Radio Line of Sight
With no intervening obstacles, the optical line of sight can be expressed as:
d = 3.572h
where d is the distance between an antenna and the horizon in kilometers and h is
the antenna height in meters. The effective, or radio, line of sight to the horizon is expressed as (Figure 4.9)
d = 3.572Kh

The exact value is 299,792,458 m/s.

where K is an adjustment factor to account for the refraction. A good rule of thumb
is K = 4>3. Thus, the maximum distance between two antennas for LOS propagation is 3.57 A 2Kh1 + 2Kh2 B , where h1 and h2 are the heights of the two antennas.
Example 4.3 The maximum distance between two antennas for LOS transmission if one antenna is 100 m high and the other is at ground level is
d = 3.57 2Kh = 3.572133 = 41 km
Now suppose that the receiving antenna is 10 m high. To achieve the same distance, how high must the transmitting antenna be? The result is
41 = 3.57 A 2Kh1 + 213.3 B
41
2Kh1 =
- 213.3 = 7.84
3.57
h1 = 7.84 2>1.33 = 46.2 m
This is a savings of over 50 m in the height of the transmitting antenna. This example illustrates the benefit of raising receiving antennas above ground level
to reduce the necessary height of the transmitter.

4.4 LINE-OF-SIGHT TRANSMISSION
Section 3.3 discussed various transmission impairments common to both guided and
wireless transmission. In this section, we extend the discussion to examine some impairments specific to wireless line-of-sight transmission.

Free Space Loss
For any type of wireless communication the signal disperses with distance. Therefore, an antenna with a fixed area will receive less signal power the farther it is from
the transmitting antenna. For satellite communication this is the primary mode of

STAL-04-093-128.I

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

signal loss. Even if no other sources of attenuation or impairment are assumed, a
transmitted signal attenuates over distance because the signal is being spread over a
larger and larger area. This form of attenuation is known as free space loss, which
can be express in terms of the ratio of the radiated power Pt to the power Pr received
by the antenna or, in decibels, by taking 10 times the log of that ratio. For the ideal
isotropic antenna, free space loss is

Figure 4.10 illustrates the free space loss equation.2
For other antennas, we must take into account the gain of the antenna, which
yields the following free space loss equation:

As was mentioned in Appendix 3A, there is some inconsistency in the literature over the use of the
terms gain and loss. Equation (4.3) follows the convention of Equation (2.2).

The third fraction is derived from the second fraction using the relationship
between antenna gain and effective area defined in Equation (4.1). We can recast
the loss equation as
LdB = 20 log1l2 + 20 log1d2 - 10 log1A t A r2

= -20 log1f2 + 20 log1d2 - 10 log1A t A r2 + 169.54 dB

(4.4)

Thus, for the same antenna dimensions and separation, the longer the carrier wavelength (lower the carrier frequency f), the higher is the free space path loss. It is interesting to compare Equations (4.3) and (4.4). Equation (4.3) indicates that as the
frequency increases, the free space loss also increases, which would suggest that at
higher frequencies, losses become more burdensome. However, Equation (4.4)
shows that we can easily compensate for this increased loss with antenna gains.

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

In fact, there is a net gain at higher frequencies, other factors remaining constant.
Equation (4.3) shows that at a fixed distance an increase in frequency results in an
increased loss measured by 20log1f2. However, if we take into account antenna
gain, and fix antenna area, then the change in loss is measured by -20log1f2; that is,
there is actually a decrease in loss at higher frequencies.

Example 4.4 Determine the isotropic free space loss at 4 GHz for the shortest path to a synchronous satellite from earth (35,863 km). At 4 GHz, the wavelength is 13 * 1082>14 * 1092 = 0.075 m. Then,
LdB = -20 log10.0752 + 20 log135.853 * 1062 + 21.98 = 195.6 dB
Now consider the antenna gain of both the satellite- and ground-based antennas.
Typical values are 44 dB and 48 dB, respectively. The free space loss is
LdB = 195.6 - 44 - 48 = 103.6 dB
Now assume a transmit power of 250 W at the earth station. What is the power
received at the satellite antenna? A power of 250 W translates into 24 dBW, so
the power at the receiving antenna is 24 - 103.6 = -79.6 dBW.

Atmospheric Absorption
An additional loss between the transmitting and receiving antennas is atmospheric absorption. Water vapor and oxygen contribute most to attenuation. A peak attenuation occurs in the vicinity of 22 GHz due to water vapor. At frequencies
below 15 GHz, the attenuation is less. The presence of oxygen results in an absorption peak in the vicinity of 60 GHz but contributes less at frequencies below
30 GHz. Rain and fog (suspended water droplets) cause scattering of radio waves
that results in attenuation. In this context, the term scattering refers to the production of waves of changed direction or frequency when radio waves encounter matter. This can be a major cause of signal loss. Thus, in areas of significant
precipitation, either path lengths have to be kept short or lower-frequency bands
should be used.

Multipath
For wireless facilities where there is a relatively free choice of where antennas are to
be located, they can be placed so that if there are no nearby interfering obstacles,
there is a direct line-of-sight path from transmitter to receiver. This is generally the
case for many satellite facilities and for point-to-point microwave. In other cases,
such as mobile telephony, there are obstacles in abundance. The signal can be
reflected by such obstacles so that multiple copies of the signal with varying delays

(b) Mobile radio

can be received. In fact, in extreme cases, there may be no direct signal. Depending
on the differences in the path lengths of the direct and reflected waves, the composite signal can be either larger or smaller than the direct signal. Reinforcement and
cancellation of the signal resulting from the signal following multiple paths can be
controlled for communication between fixed, well-sited antennas, and between
satellites and fixed ground stations. One exception is when the path goes across
water, where the wind keeps the reflective surface of the water in motion. For mobile telephony and communication to antennas that are not well sited, multipath
considerations can be paramount.
Figure 4.11 illustrates in general terms the types of multipath interference typical in terrestrial, fixed microwave and in mobile communications. For fixed microwave, in addition to the direct line of sight, the signal may follow a curved path
through the atmosphere due to refraction and the signal may also reflect from the
ground. For mobile communications, structures and topographic features provide
reflection surfaces.

Refraction
Radio waves are refracted (or bent) when they propagate through the atmosphere. The refraction is caused by changes in the speed of the signal with altitude
or by other spatial changes in the atmospheric conditions. Normally, the speed of

STAL-04-093-128.I

10:54 AM

CHAPTER 4 / TRANSMISSION MEDIA

the signal increases with altitude, causing radio waves to bend downward. However, on occasion, weather conditions may lead to variations in speed with height
that differ significantly from the typical variations. This may result in a situation
in which only a fraction or no part of the line-of-sight wave reaches the receiving
antenna.

Show that doubling the transmission frequency or doubling the distance between
transmitting antenna and receiving antenna attenuates the power received by 6 dB.
It turns out that the depth in the ocean to which airborne electromagnetic signals can
be detected grows with the wavelength. Therefore, the military got the idea of using
very long wavelengths corresponding to about 30 Hz to communicate with submarines throughout the world. It is desirable to have an antenna that is about onehalf wavelength long. How long would that be?
The audio power of the human voice is concentrated at about 300 Hz. Antennas of
the appropriate size for this frequency are impracticably large, so that to send voice
by radio the voice signal must be used to modulate a higher (carrier) frequency for
which the natural antenna size is smaller.
a. What is the length of an antenna one-half wavelength long for sending radio at
300 Hz?
b. An alternative is to use a modulation scheme, as described in Chapter 5, for transmitting the voice signal by modulating a carrier frequency, so that the bandwidth
of the signal is a narrow band centered on the carrier frequency. Suppose we
would like a half-wave antenna to have a length of 1 meter. What carrier frequency would we use?
Stories abound of people who receive radio signals in fillings in their teeth. Suppose
you have one filling that is 2.5 mm (0.0025 m) long that acts as a radio antenna. That
is, it is equal in length to one-half the wavelength. What frequency do you receive?
You are communicating between two satellites. The transmission obeys the free space
law. The signal is too weak. Your vendor offers you two options. The vendor can use
a higher frequency that is twice the current frequency or can double the effective area
of both of the antennas. Which will offer you more received power or will both offer
the same improvement, all other factors remaining equal? How much improvement
in the received power do you obtain from the best option?
For radio transmission in free space, signal power is reduced in proportion to the
square of the distance from the source, whereas in wire transmission, the attenuation
is a fixed number of dB per kilometer. The following table is used to show the dB
reduction relative to some reference for free space radio and uniform wire. Fill in the

back in lines parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. To demonstrate this, consider the
parabola y 2 = 2px shown in Figure 4.12. Let P1x1 ,y12 be a point on the parabola, and
PF be the line from P to the focus. Construct the line L through P parallel to the
x-axis and the line M tangent to the parabola at P. The angle between L and M is b,
and the angle between PF and M is a. The angle a is the angle at which a ray from F
strikes the parabola at P. Because the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, the ray reflected from P must be at an angle a to M. Thus, if we can show that
a = b, we have demonstrated that rays reflected from the parabola starting at F will
be parallel to the x-axis.
