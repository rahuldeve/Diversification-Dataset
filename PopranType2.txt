down slope where required.

  Where practicable, clear a 1m radius around dead

  Avoid  ignition  of  backburns  at  bottom  of  slopes

where a long and intense upslope burn is likely.

into  account  for  threatened  species,  fire  regimes

  Minimise burn area where possible.

  The  first  combatant  agency  onsite  may  assume
control  of  the  fire,  but  then  must  ensure  the
relevant  land  management  agency  is  promptly
notified.

  On  the  arrival  of  other  combatant  agencies,  the
initial incident controller will consult with regard to
the  ongoing  command,  control  and 
incident
management  requirements  as  per  the  relevant
BFMC Plan of Operations.

  Wetting  and  foaming  agents  (surfactants)  are

permitted for use in wildfire suppression.

  The use of fire retardant is only permitted with the
prior  consent  of  the  senior  NPWS  Officer,  and
should  be  avoided  when  other 
reasonable
alternatives are available.

  Exclude  the  use  of  surfactants  and  retardants
within 50m of rainforests, watercourses, dams and

in  containment 

  The  potential  impacts  of  smoke  and  possible
mitigation 
tactics  must  be  considered  when
planning  for  wildfire  suppression  and  prescribed
burning operations.

  If  smoke  becomes  a  hazard  on  local  roads  or
highways,  the  police  and  relevant  media  must  be
notified.

  Smoke  management  must  be  in  accordance  with

relevant RTA traffic management guidelines.
  Notify neighbours of potential smoke hazard.
  Popran  National  Park  contains  a  number  of
potential  natural  fire  control  advantages  including
cleared lands, rainforest and waterbodies.

  Experience  has  shown  that  linking  these  natural
fire  control  advantages  with  wet  lines  /  hand  tool
lines etc may effectively contain wildfires.

  Potential natural fire control advantages should be
checked  prior  to  being  relied  upon  to  contain  a
wildfire because their strength  varies according to
prevailing environmental conditions.

  Wherever possible avoid burning rainforest.
  The  use  of  bombing  aircraft 

to  support
containment  operations  is  often  effective  in  this
reserve  due  to  the  steep  terrain  and  proximity  of
water bodies.

  Foam  can  be  used  with  NPWS  Area  Manager

approval to increase the effectiveness of water.

  Avoid  foam  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas  eg

within 20m of creek or wetland.

  Ground  crews  must  be  alerted  to  water  bombing

operations.

  Salt water permitted for water bombing operations

in all areas.

  The  park  may  be  closed  to  the  public  during
periods  of  extreme  fire  danger  or  during  wildfire
suppression operations.

  Where  practicable  containment  lines  should  be
stabilised  and  rehabilitated  as  part  of  the  wildfire
suppression operation.

Earthmoving
Equipment
(NPWS FMM
4.2.20 & 4.3)

 

 

 

 

Earthmoving equipment may only be used  with
the  prior  consent  of  senior  NPWS  Officer,  and
then only if the probability of success is high.
Earthmoving equipment must be always guided
and  supervised  by  an  experienced  officer,  and
accompanied  by  a  support  vehicle.    When
engaged  in  direct  or  parallel  attack this  vehicle
must be a fire fighting vehicle.
Containment  lines  constructed  by  earthmoving
equipment  should  consider  the  protection  of
drainage 
the  Threatened
Species  and  Cultural  Heritage  Management
Operational  Guidelines,  and  be  surveyed,
where  possible  to  identify  unknown  cultural
heritage sites.
Earthmoving  equipment  should  be  washed

NPWS Estate.

features,  observe 

Strategy Information
Fire Season Information

  Most  extreme 

fire  weather  conditions
occur  during  spring  and  early  summer
resulting  from  higher  mean  temperatures,
lower relative humidity and strong winds.

  Winds  from  the  north-southwest  sector
which  are  warmer  and  lower  in  humidity
will  significantly  raise  the  bushfire  danger
rating when higher windspeeds occur and
generally  provide  the  most  difficult  fire
weather conditions.

  General  season  is Autumn  to  late  Winter.
Burning is possible in early Spring but not
desirable  on  a  regular  basis  from  an
ecological point of view.

Subject to crew safety, undertake indirect, parallel or direct attack
along existing control lines.
Aims are to minimise the area burnt, avoid risks to adjoining assets
and avoiding impacts to cultural and biodiversity values.
Strategies should also minimise impacts on transport infrastructure.
Early consideration should be given to visitor safety and reserve
closure, particularly when Fire Danger is Very High or above.
Hand tool lines can be used to minimise burnt area if conditions are
suitable.
Identify and survey alternate backup containment lines.
Subject to crew safety and where possible, implement threatened
species and cultural heritage management guidelines.

  Where practicable, clear a 1m radius around dead
and  fibrous  barked  trees  adjacent  to  containment
lines prior to backburning, or wet down these trees
as part of the backburn ignition.

  Avoid  ignition  of  backburns  at  bottom  of  slopes

where a long and intense upslope burn is likely.

  Liase  with  NPWS  to  ensure  backburning  takes
into  account  for  threatened  species,  fire  regimes
and cultural heritage guidelines.

  Minimise burn area where possible.

  The  first  combatant  agency  onsite  may  assume
control  of  the  fire,  but  then  must  ensure  the
relevant  land  management  agency  is  promptly
notified.

  On  the  arrival  of  other  combatant  agencies,  the
initial incident controller will consult with regard to
the  ongoing  command,  control  and 
incident
management  requirements  as  per  the  relevant
BFMC Plan of Operations.

  Wetting  and  foaming  agents  (surfactants)  are

permitted for use in wildfire suppression.

  The use of fire retardant is only permitted with the
prior  consent  of  the  senior  NPWS  Officer,  and
should  be  avoided  when  other 
reasonable
alternatives are available.

  Exclude  the  use  of  surfactants  and  retardants
within 50m of rainforests, watercourses, dams and
swamps.

  Areas where fire suppression chemicals  are  used
must  be  mapped  and  the  used  product's  name
recorded.

  The  Threatened  Species  Operational  Guidelines

are to be observed.

  Construction  of  new  containment  lines  should  be
avoided, where practicable except where they can
be  constructed  with  minimal  environmental
impact.    New  containment  lines  require  prior
consent from senior NPWS Officer.

  Where  practicable,  containment  lines  should  be
stabilised  and  rehabilitated  as  part  of  the  wildfire
suppression operation.

  All  containment 

for  other
purposes should be closed at the cessation of the

in  containment 

  The  potential  impacts  of  smoke  and  possible
mitigation 
tactics  must  be  considered  when
planning  for  wildfire  suppression  and  prescribed
burning operations.

  If  smoke  becomes  a  hazard  on  local  roads  or
highways,  the  police  and  relevant  media  must  be
notified.

  Smoke  management  must  be  in  accordance  with

relevant RTA traffic management guidelines.
  Notify neighbours of potential smoke hazard.
  Popran  National  Park  contains  a  number  of
potential  natural  fire  control  advantages  including
cleared lands, rainforest and waterbodies.

  Experience  has  shown  that  linking  these  natural
fire  control  advantages  with  wet  lines  /  hand  tool
lines etc may effectively contain wildfires.

  Potential natural fire control advantages should be
checked  prior  to  being  relied  upon  to  contain  a
wildfire because their strength varies according to
prevailing environmental conditions.

  Wherever possible avoid burning rainforest.
  The  use  of  bombing  aircraft 

to  support
containment  operations  is  often  effective  in  this
reserve  due  to  the  steep  terrain  and  proximity  of
water bodies.

  Foam  can  be  used  with  NPWS  Area  Manager

approval to increase the effectiveness of water.

  Avoid  foam  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas  eg

within 20m of creek or wetland.

  Ground  crews  must  be  alerted  to  water  bombing

operations.

  Salt water permitted for water bombing operations

in all areas.

  The  park  may  be  closed  to  the  public  during
periods  of  extreme  fire  danger  or  during  wildfire
suppression operations.

  Where  practicable  containment  lines  should  be
stabilised  and  rehabilitated  as  part  of  the  wildfire
suppression operation.

Strategy Information
Fire Season Information

  Most  extreme 

fire  weather  conditions
occur  during  spring  and  early  summer
resulting  from  higher  mean  temperatures,
lower relative humidity and strong winds.

  Winds  from  the  north-southwest  sector
which  are  warmer  and  lower  in  humidity
will  significantly  raise  the  bushfire  danger
rating when higher windspeeds occur and
generally  provide  the  most  difficult  fire
weather conditions.

  General  season  is Autumn  to  late  Winter.
Burning is possible in early Spring but not
desirable  on  a  regular  basis  from  an
ecological point of view.

- 

- 
- 

Subject to crew safety, undertake indirect, parallel or direct attack
along existing control lines.
Aims are to minimise the area burnt, avoid risks to adjoining assets
and avoiding impacts to cultural and biodiversity values.
Strategies should also minimise impacts on transport infrastructure.
Early consideration should be given to visitor safety and reserve
closure, particularly when Fire Danger is Very High or above.
Hand tool lines can be used to minimise burnt area if conditions are
suitable.
Identify and survey alternate backup containment lines.
Subject to crew safety and where possible, implement threatened
species and cultural heritage management guidelines.

**Crew Safety should always be first priorty**
