16.  Abstract

The purpose of the Revised Catalog of Types of CODES Applications Implemented Using Linked
State Data (CODES) is to inspire the development of new applications for linked data that support
efforts to reduce death, disability, severity, and health care costs related to motor vehicle crashes.  
The document is divided into three sections.  The Introduction describes the purpose of the Catalog,
the evolution and components of CODES, and the CODES states.  The Background section
discusses data resources and case selection, issues related to as reported data and the linkage
process, and the organization of information included in the catalog.  The final section presents
abstracts of the types of state-specific applications developed or in process as of June 2000. 
NHTSA will update the catalog on a periodic basis as the CODES states develop new applications.

1.0  INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose of the Catalog 

The purpose of the Revised Catalog of Types of CODES Applications Implemented Using Linked
State Data (CODES) is to inspire the development of new applications for linked data that support efforts
to reduce death, disability, severity, and health care costs related to motor vehicle crashes.   The document
is divided into three sections.  The Introduction describes the purpose of the Catalog, the evolution and
components of CODES, and the CODES states.  The Background section discusses data resources and
case  selection,  issues  related  to  as  reported  data  and  the  linkage  process,  and  the  organization  of
information included in the catalog.  The final section presents abstracts of some of the types of state-
specific applications developed or in process to date.  NHTSA will update the catalog on a periodic basis
as  the  newly  funded  CODES  states  develop  new  applications.    This  version  of  the  Catalog  includes
applications developed as of June 2000.

1.2 Evolution of CODES

The Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES) project evolved from the Intermodal Surface
Transportation  Efficiency  Act  (ISTEA)  of  1991  which  mandated  that  the  National  Traffic  Safety
Administration (NHTSA) report to Congress about the benefits of safety belts and motorcycle helmets in
motor vehicle crashes.  Benefits were to be measured in terms of reductions in death, disability, and medical
costs.   Since none of the crash and various injury state data files contains sufficient information to identify
the  specific  crash,  vehicle,  and  behavior  characteristics  that  make  a  difference  to  outcome,  NHTSA
determined that only linked statewide data could provide the necessary outcome information for all persons
involved -- those who were injured or who died and those who were not injured.  Using these data,
comparisons between those using and not using safety belts or motorcycle helmets could be made by
identifying and contrasting the characteristics of the injured and uninjured persons within each of the use
groups.  Also by using state data, the linked data could be used to support state specific purposes and
could be disaggregated to support safety efforts at the local and regional levels.
 
1.3 A Description of CODES

CODES consists of linked statewide crash and injury data that match vehicle, crash, and human behavior
characteristics to their specific medical and financial outcomes.  These state data are located in multiple
sources: crash data collected by police at the scene; EMS data collected by EMTs who provide treatment
at the scene and enroute; medical data collected by physicians, nurses and others who provide treatment
at  the  emergency  department,  in  the  hospital,  or  outpatient  setting;  and  third  party  payors  who  pay.
Linkage enables persons involved in the motor vehicle crash to be traced from the scene to their final
medical  and  financial  outcomes.    To  implement  CODES,  states,  as  a  minimum,  need  computerized
statewide crash, hospital, and  EMS or emergency department data that have sufficient information to
discriminate among the crash events and persons involved in each event.  When these data are also linked
to  driver  licensing,  vehicle  registration,  citation/conviction  records,  insurance  claims,  HMO/managed
care/etc. outpatient records, etc., the linked data are more comprehensive and thus even more useful for

state specific purposes.  Although state data are frequently imperfect, linkage is feasible using a probabilistic
linkage technology that identifies valid matches without requiring exact matches among the attribute values.
This technology makes it possible to process a phenomenal amount of data in a short amount of time.
Successful implementation of CODES depends upon a Board of Directors consisting of the data owners
who collaboratively resolve issues related to data access, patient confidentiality, management and release
of the linked data and institutionalization of CODES.   A CODES Advisory Committee consisting of both
the data owners and users develops and monitors applications of the linked data.  An added benefit of data
linkage is that data quality improves when missing and inaccurate data highlighted during the linkage process
are corrected.

NHTSA funded Hawaii, Maine, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wisconsin to implement
Crash Outcome Data Evaluation Systems (CODES) to generate linked state crash and injury data for the
Report to Congress and for state specific purposes.  Statewide police reported crash reports were linked
to emergency medical services, emergency department, hospital discharge, rehabilitation, long term care,
death certificate and/or claims data as shown in Exhibit 1.  Each CODES states linked data base varies
in terms of the data files linked but all of them include at least 12 months of person-specific, population-
based, statewide data that permit tracking of persons involved in motor vehicle crashes from the scene to
final disposition.  Each state controls access to its linked data.  To encourage the development of new
applications  for  linked  data,  NHTSA  funded  three  of  the  CODES  states  (New  York,  Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin) and three other states (Alaska, Connecticut, and New Mexico) to use their existing linked state
data to develop additional state-specific applications.  To encourage the development of data linkage
capabilities in all states nationally, NHTSA funded Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota in 1997;  Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska and South
Carolina in 1998; and Arizona, Delaware, Minnesota and Tennessee in 1999.  Additional states will be
funded in 2000.

2.0 BACKGROUND

2.1.  Data Resources and Case Selection

For computerized data files to be linked, they must exist.  Unfortunately, not all states have crash and injury
data that are statewide and computerized.  Almost all of the states have computerized crash data statewide.
Half of the states have developed state EMS data systems, but less have statewide emergency department
data systems. A majority of the states have computerized state hospital discharge data systems.  All of the
states  have  computerized  Medicaid  and  Medicare  data  systems,  but  few  states  have  statewide
computerized data files for private vehicle or health insurance claims data.  Access to data for the less
seriously injured victims, a group that includes many of the successes for highway safety, is difficult to obtain
because the data may not be computerized.  Or if computerized, they are computerized by provider or by
insurance group and rarely statewide.  Injury data are particularly useful to highway safety because they
document what happens to all victims injured in motor vehicle crashes, regardless of whether the crash itself
meets police reporting thresholds. 

More information about the experience of the seven original CODES states performing the data linkage
may be obtained from the  Technical  Report:  Crash  Outcome  Data  Evaluation  System  Project
published by NHTSA.  Table 1 below presents the study populations that can be generated from the
linkage of different groups of state data files.

2.2 Issues Related to As Reported Data and the Linkage Process 

The usefulness of existing computerized state data collected for other purposes and then linked to fulfill
highway safety data needs depends upon the quality of as reported state data.  The user must understand
what and how the state data are collected since data quality reflects the environment of the crash and the
existence of legislative mandates.  The following issues must be considered when developing applications
for linked crash and injury state data.

Revised Catalog of Types of Applications Implemented Using Linked State Data 

page - 3

2.2.1  Utilization of Safety Measures:  Crash data document the events of a crash including
utilization information to support police enforcement activities related to safety devices.  Over or
under reporting of utilization may be related to the existence and enforcement of laws and insurance
regulations mandating their use, or non-use in the case of alcohol.  For example, when a state
penalizes occupants who fail to buckle up, the unbelted occupant involved in a crash may be
tempted to report belt use, particularly when the crash or injury is minor.  Thus, as reported data
alone may inflate the calculations of effectiveness.  Combining as reported with observed or
linked data is likely to generate more realistic rates.

2.2.2  Defining an Injury:   Injury data include medical information about the occurrence of
injuries and their costs.  Without linkage to the crash data, victims injured in a motor vehicle crash
can be identified in the injury data only when the medical record documents the external cause of
injury (motor vehicle crash, fall, etc.), for example by an E-code.  Use of the E-code is useful to
identify records for injuries caused by a motor vehicle crash that failed to link to a crash report or
were not reportable because the crash occurred on a non-public road.   Thus, use of both crash
and injury data together is more likely to identify more  injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes
than use of the crash or injury data alone.  

2.2.3  Identifying the Type of Injury: Documentation of the type of injury varies in the different
state data files.  Non-medical data sources, such as the crash report, may document the area and
type of injury in general terms such as head, neck, bleeding and broken bone.  Injury severity in
this type of data is documented in functional terms to indicate the need for help from the scene
(killed, incapacitated, non-incapacitated, possible, none).  Medical data sources use more specific
terms.  EMS data indicate specific types and areas of injury augmented by information describing
the treatment provided and record injury severity using the patients vital signs.  Hospital data
document the area and type of injury using medical terms coded according to the International
Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM).  Injury severity is then
defined in anatomical terms based on the ICD-9-CM codes.  Thus, a group of head injured
patients selected from the crash data is likely to include non-head injuries compared to a group of
head injured patients selected from the more precise hospital data.  

2.2.4  Identifying Costs and Charges:   Injury data document the total charges associated with
providing medical care to a specific patient but do not document the actual cost of providing care
or  the  actual  revenue  received  by  the  provider  of  the  care  for  that  specific  patient.  Charge
information  is  recorded  for  patients  discharged  from  an  acute  care  hospital.    Sometimes  this
information is also available from billing records for patients transported by EMS or treated in the
emergency department.  It is important to note that total charges represent the price charged for
treatment.   Charge information documented in EMS, emergency department, and hospital data
systems may not include charges by private physicians who are not on the staff of the facility/agency
where the patient is treated.  Charge information also does not include the indirect costs, such as
loss of productivity or long term care and social support, incurred by those suffering long term
disability.  The bottom line is that total charges are commonly used to report costs of health care.
However, the user must remember that the charge information that is available understates the total

page - 4   Revised Catalog of Types of Applications Implemented Using Linked State Data

expenses incurred as the result of motor vehicle crashes.

2.2.5 The Linkage Process:  Some measures, such as effectiveness rates for countermeasures,
are not affected by the linkage process unless the false negative rate  (records for injured victims
that should have linked but did not) and/or the false positive rate (records for non-injured victims
that linked but should not have) are high enough to cause the injured and uninjured populations to
be misrepresented.  These  rates may cause totals, such as total EMS transports, hospitalizations,
charges, and hospital days, to be incorrect.  In addition, average charges may be understated if
failure to link records contain injured persons with unusually high hospital charges and long lengths
of stay or overstated if a false positive linkage included a hospital record with unusually high
hospital charges and long lengths of stay.   

Records with more discriminating information about the events and persons involved are more
likely to match than records with less information.  For example, date of birth is frequently available
on the crash report only for drivers.  Without the capability to obtain date of birth for non-drivers
through ancillary linkages, injury records for drivers are more likely to link than those for non-
drivers.   The potential for systematic biases to occur can be estimated by reviewing the reporting
thresholds, variations in submission and data quality rates by police agency, provider, or geographic
service area to ensure that specific population groups, types of services, etc. are not under- or
over-reported for either the injured or uninjured. 

 

Thus, before performing any analyses, the accuracy and completeness of the linked data must be
evaluated relative to the type of study population and the outcome measures used for the study.

2.3 Organization of the Catalog

This catalog presents some of the types of state specific applications developed or in process to date by
the CODES states.  The applications published in this version reflect how the linked state data are being
used to support state-specific efforts. The types of applications are listed under one of seven subject areas:
Injury Prevention, Traffic Safety, Highway Safety, EMS, General Applications, Data Quality, and Linkage
Process.  Within each subject area, the applications are categorized by topic area.  Exhibit 2 presents the
topic areas included within each subject area. Within each topic area, the applications are sorted by type
(study,  fact  sheet,  management  report)  and  listed  alphabetically  by  state.    A  study  presents  research
information in a narrative format. A fact sheet presents information using bullet statements, charts and
limited narrative.  A management report presents data in rows and columns.

Data Used

All drivers involved in 1997 crashes in Kentucky
Crash data linked to TBI cases taken from trauma registries, hospital 
discharges, and death certificates.
Study
A total 618 drivers were selected from 1,213 fatal and nonfatal TBI cases that
had been identified using the standard Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) definition. The driver TBI cases were obtained from linked
crash, hospital discharge, death certificate, and trauma registry.  These TBI
drivers are being matched against the 1997 crash file.  From the unlinked
crashes, two controls will be selected at random for each linked TBI driver. 
Logistic regression will be used to determine the predictive value of driver age
and gender, type of crash, type of  roadway on which the crash occurred, type
of vehicle being driven, use of occupant safety equipment by the driver, and
driver use of alcohol or other drugs for TBI as a result of a crash.

The Cost of Motor Vehicle Crash Injuries to the Wisconsin Medicaid Program
Trudy A. Karlson, Martha D. Sumi, Daniel Wickeham, Charles Quade, and Sara Karon

Scope

All persons involved in 1991 motor vehicle crashes statewide in Wisconsin. 

Data Used

Crash linked to Medicaid data

Format

Description

Study

This study describes an algorithm developed to identify the crash-related health
care specifically provided by physician, hospital, long term care, and other
services to Medicaid beneficiaries.   It identifies the cost of this care for
beneficiaries who were occupants, pedestrians, or motorcyclists.  Costs are
identified for (1) individuals who were Medicaid-eligible prior to the crash, and (2)
individuals who became eligible immediately following the crash as a result of
severe injuries requiring expensive care.  Costs for those who became eligible
two or three years after the crash when the payments from their liability
settlements finally ran out are not included. Alcohol and safety belt use are
considered in relation to the costs.

Studies

Scope

All persons involved in motor vehicle crashes occurring between 1986-1996 in
Hawaii.  Crash linked to EMS and claims data for 1990-93 and crash linked to
hospital data for 1993-96 were also used. 

Data Used

Crash data linked to EMS and hospital data.

Format

Description

Study

This study presents crash and injury outcome multipliers to examine the relative
safety of various types of crashes.  Using the crash as the unit of analysis, a
measure is derived for the number of fatalities, incapacitating, non-serious
injuries, EMS transports and hospitalizations that are produced by a particular
crash type.  The measure can be used to compare the seriousness of different
types of crashes and safety concerns.  The technique is illustrated using both
police crash injury data (KABCO) as well as linked CODES data.  Potential
uses for the measure are described.

Study

This study describes the relationship of safety belt use and need for specific
EMS treatments.  Two models of injury severity based upon EMS interventions
are developed to evaluate the effects of seat belt usage on crash related
characteristics which affect injury severity.  Data were analyzed using logistic
regression. Results show that more serious EMS treatments (e.g., bleeding
control, cervical immobilization, intravenous placement, oxygen therapy, spinal
immobilization, and ventilation) are less likely in belted occupants who had an
EMS response.

Shoulder Belts in Motor Vehicle Crashes: A Statewide Analysis of Restraint Efficacy in Utah
Stacey Knight, Lawrence J. Cook, Patricia J. Nechodom, Lenora M. Olson, James C. Reading,
J. Michael Dean

Scope

Front seat occupants over the age of 11 years in passenger cars in Utah
between 1994 and 1996. 

Data Used

Crash linked to inpatient hospital discharge data

Format

Description

Study

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a shoulder belt without a lap belt in
reducing ejection, morbidity and mortality of front seat passengers involved in
motor vehicle crashes in Utah.  The effectiveness of shoulder belt only use in a
motor vehicle crash is examined by analyzing linked police reported crash data
with inpatient hospital discharge data for 1994-1996.  Stochastic simulations
are used to compensate for possible misclassification of seatbelt usage.

Data Used

Crash data and death certificates linked to master driver license file

Format

Description

Study

This study evaluates the crash and citation rates of drivers in the medical
conditions drivers program in Utah, compared with age- and location- matched
controls.  Medical conditions drivers fell into two groups: those who had driver
license restrictions (time of day, roads, or locations) and those who had no
restrictions.  A limitation of the study and the program is that the medical
conditions program is voluntary, relying on drivers to identify themselves as
having medical conditions.

Crash linked to EMS , hospital and medical insurance claims data

Study

This study estimates the extent of police under reporting of collisions in Hawaii. 
Persons involved in police reported crashes ($1000 property damage or injury)
were matched to health records for persons whose cause of injury was flagged
as a motor vehicle crash.  Unreported crashes were defined as those health
records for the motor vehicle crash victims that did not match to a crash record. 
Crash reports are more likely to be missing when the injuries are minor, injury
symptoms do not appear until later, the victim leaves the scene before the police
arrive, the police are never called, the records are lost during processing, or
inaccurate data prevented the records from linking.

for occupant, vehicle and site characteristics are mapped into variables in the
crash data to calculate a probability of belt use for every passenger vehicle
occupant whose crash record contained sufficient vehicle, site and occupant
information.  A new dichotomous variable is created to assign occupants belt
use according to a new algorithm.   Information obtained from a medical record
review is also used to justify the new algorithm.
