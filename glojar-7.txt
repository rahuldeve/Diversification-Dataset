Perhaps you have heard of the greenhouse effect.  In a greenhouse, short-wave radiation from 
sunlight passes freely through the glass and is converted to long-wave radiation inside.  But the 
long-wave radiation cannot pass back out through the glass.  The result is a build-up of heat 
inside the greenhouse from the captured solar energy.  Certain gases in Earths atmosphere  
especially water vapor and carbon dioxide  act in much the same way as the glass in a 
greenhouse.  We call this situation the greenhouse effect, and we call these gases the 
greenhouse gases, because of their ability to trap energy from sunlight.  Most greenhouse gases 
occur naturally, but some are being added to the atmosphere because of human actions. 
 
Global warming refers to the rise in temperatures at Earths surface and lower atmosphere over 
the last century.  Most scientists believe that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are 
contributing to global warming.  The danger in this warming is that it could disrupt Earths climate 
patterns, cause coastal flooding, and force major adjustments in the way people live.  The more 
we are able to learn about the causes and effects of global warming, the better prepared we may 
be to deal with the possible consequences of a changing environment. 
 
In this set of experiments you will use models of Earths atmosphere to see how it is warmed by 
sunlight.  You will also discover how lakes and seas affect this warming by storing and releasing 
energy from the sun. 
 
Materials:  Large pickle jars, smaller jelly jar, laboratory thermometers, white cardboard, sheets of 
812  11 white paper, transparent tape, clear plastic wrap, rubber bands, water, anti-fog 
solution, timer or clock, activity log sheet, graph sheet, question-and-answer sheet. 
 
Preparation:  This activity requires a location where there is direct sunlight for a sustained period 
of time. The experiments use three different models for Earths atmosphere, as shown below.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two different experiments are presented, each experiment using a different pair of models: 
  
Experiment 1:  Models A and B, where A is the control, and the cover (B) is the variable. 
Experiment 2:  Models B and C, where B is the control, and water (C) is the variable.  
 
Your teacher will tell you which experiments to do and which models to use.  Directions for 
building the models are given on the next page.  Note: Prepare each model out of direct sunlight.

Model A:  A laboratory thermometer is placed inside a large pickle jar which is left uncovered.  
Before placing the thermometer, tape it to a strip of cardboard that is a little bit longer and wider 
than the thermometer.  Stand the thermometer on the bottom of the jar and lean it at a slight 
angle against the wall of the jar. 
 
Model B:  Like Model A, except that the jar opening is sealed with clear plastic wrap and a rubber 
band.  Before sealing the jar, spray or wipe a light film of anti-fog solution on the inside of the 
pickle jar.  This coating will make it possible to read the thermometer in the event that water vapor 
condenses on the inside of the jar during the experiment. 
 
Model C:  Like Model B, except that a jelly jar filled with water is added to the setup.  Start by 
spraying or wiping the anti-fog solution onto the inside surface of the pickle jar.  Fill the jelly jar 
almost to the top with water and place it inside the larger jar.  (Important: The water should be 
brought exactly to room temperature before use.)  Add a laboratory thermometer to read air 
temperature inside the pickle jar.  Place a second thermometer inside the water-filled jar.  The 
two thermometers should face the same direction.   
 
Each of the models represents a different set of conditions in Earths atmosphere:   
 
(cid:1)  Model A is the control for Experiment 1.  It represents Earths atmosphere as it would be 

without greenhouse gases to trap energy from the sun. 

 
(cid:1)  Model B has a cover that helps to capture energy from sunlight.  The cover acts like 

greenhouse gases in Earths atmosphere.  What will happen to the air inside this jar?  (When 
performing Experiment 2, this model serves as the control instead of Model A.) 

 
(cid:1)  Model C represents Earths atmosphere next to an ocean or other large body of water.  Will 

the presence of water produce results that are different from what happens in Model B? 

 
Procedure: 
 
1.  Place each model on a sheet of white paper in direct sunlight.  Read and record the temperature 

of each thermometer immediately.  Repeat this measurement every 5 minutes for the first 30 
minutes.  After the first half-hour, readings may be taken and recorded at 15-minute intervals. 

   
2.  At the beginning and throughout the experiment, the large jars should be turned so that direct 
sunlight does not fall on the faces of the air temperature thermometers.  The sunlight should 
fall on the backs of the cardboard strips instead.  In this way, accurate readings of air 
temperature inside the jars will be possible. 

 
3.  After completing each round of temperature measurements, observe the jars to see if there 
are any visible changes taking place inside.  Record any changes you see on the log sheet. 

 
4.  At some point in the experiment your teacher may draw down the window shades, or the 

sunlight may turn to shadow.  If so, make a note in your activity log as to when this lighting 
change occurs.  Then begin again to read and record temperatures every five minutes for the 
next 30 minutes, and every 15 minutes thereafter until the experiment is stopped. 

 
5.  Make a line graph of the temperature data for each experiment.  There will be two or three 

graphed lines on each sheet, depending on the experiment.  Be sure to label each line. 

 
6.  Complete the question-and-answer sheet for your experiment(s).

Key Concepts 
 
The so-called greenhouse gases in our 
atmosphere  especially water vapor (H2O) and 
carbon dioxide (CO2)  have helped to warm 
Earth and make it hospitable to life as we know 
it.  If not for this warming effect, Earth would be 
approximately 33oC (59oF) cooler than it is. 
 
About half the solar energy reaching Earth is 
short-wave radiation, most of which occurs in 
the form of visible light.  Most of the remaining 
solar energy is infrared, a form of long-wave 
radiation.  A high percentage of the short-wave 
radiation is absorbed by Earths surface, where 
it is converted to infrared radiation.  The 
greenhouse gases warm Earths surface and 
lower atmosphere by absorbing and re-emitting 
infrared radiation, as depicted in the simplified 
schematic at right.   
 
While almost all of the greenhouse gases present 
in the atmosphere are the result of natural 
processes, human activity has produced 
incremental changes in both the composition of Earths atmosphere and the 
concentrations of greenhouse gases.   In the last century, the average concentration of 
carbon dioxide has increased about 25 percent, from 280 parts per million (ppm) to 
more than 350 ppm, and is still rising.  This increase has been attributed to such 
practices as large-scale deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels.   
 
The cultural (anthropogenic) enhancement of atmospheric CO2 is suspected as a 
major cause of global warming in the last hundred years.  Average global temperatures 
have risen about 0.6oC (1.0oF), over this timeframe.

Other important greenhouse gases are methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated organic 
compounds including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs).  These compounds, although present in small quantities, are 
up to thousands of times more effective as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. 
 
In the student activity Global Warming in a Jar, the three models of Earths 
atmosphere are highly simplified representations of very complex systems.  They are 
useful for demonstrating a few of the most basic concepts pertaining to climate 
mechanics and global warming.   
 
Younger students will benefit immensely from direct instruction in setting up their 
models, taking measurements, and documenting the results.  Experiment 1 is 
appropriate for the very youngest students.  Experiment 2 could be undertaken by this 
age group with considerable assistance. 
 
Older students should be able to follow the written procedures with limited guidance, 
monitoring, and intervention from the teacher.  It is important that both experiments be 
conducted at the same time, but not necessarily by every student.  Practical limitations 
of space and materials may necessitate dividing up the experiments among small work 
groups and sharing the results upon completion.  The two experiments can be 
performed together using three pickle jars, with Model B serving double duty. 
 
The experiments are designed to be conducted in direct sunlight.  The substitution of 
heat lamps is a possibility, provided that careful attention is given to equalizing the 
radiant energy from the lamps. 
 
The experimental apparatus includes both large (preferably gallon-size or larger) pickle 
jars as well as smaller jelly jars (12- to 16-ounce size works well).  If the larger jars are 
not available, the setup may be modified to use 2-liter soda bottles and 8-ounce jars.  
Remove the labels and bottoms of the soda bottles and cut off their tops before use. 
 
Even the youngest students will be able to understand the concepts of control and 
variable.  The control represents the baseline condition, which is replicated exactly in 
each setup of the experiment.  The experimental variable is the one thing that is 
changed, for the purpose of measuring its effect on the baseline condition.  By limiting 
each experiment to one variable, there is less likelihood of confusing the cause of an 
observed effect.  Thus, Model A is paired with Model B in the first experiment; while 
Model B is paired with Model C in the second experiment.   
 
In Experiment 1, the sealing of the jar is the variable.  The anticipated effect of this 
action is that the air in the jar will be warmed by sunlight, and this thermal energy will 
be contained by the cover.   If the sunlight is suddenly eliminated, the air temperature 
in the sealed jar will gradually return to that of the control. 
 
In Experiment 2, both jars are sealed, and the addition of a water reservoir is the 
variable.  The anticipated effect of this change is that both air and water will heat up.   
However, the water is a heat sink that will moderate the heating of the air.  Heres how:   
Short-wave radiation from the sun passes through the clear air but is absorbed by the 
water, where the energy is converted into long-wave radiation.  The water also absorbs 
long-wave radiation from the heated air if the air is warmer than the water.  When the

sunlight is cut off, the air temperature in the jar slowly falls to below that of the water, 
and the warmer water heats the surrounding air by emitting long-wave radiation.  The 
back-and-forth exchange of energy between air and water moderates air temperatures in 
the pickle jar and continues to do so as long as there is any temperature differential 
between the two media. 
 
Since air has a lower heat capacity (ability to store energy) than water, the air 
temperature responds more quickly to sunlight and rises faster than that of the water.  
Similarly, the air in the jar cools more quickly than the water when the experimental 
model is placed into shadow.  A comparison of the air and water temperature curves 
will show the water temperature lagging the air temperature.  
 
Because the thermal storage capacity of water allows Model C to retain more energy 
over a longer time frame, the pickle jar stays warmer and returns to ambient 
temperature more slowly after the loss of direct sunlight.  A similar phenomenon is 
repeated on a much larger scale on Earth when air masses are warmed or cooled by 
adjacent water bodies.  One prominent result is that seaside locations tend to have 
more temperate climates than inland locations, a fact that students may already be 
familiar with.  This analogy is not exact, since the air in the pickle jar is contained for 
the duration of the experiment whereas air over the ocean is constantly being replaced. 
 
In Model C, the rising temperature will cause some of the water to evaporate.  As the 
experiment progresses, the air within the jar may become saturated with water vapor so 
that condensation begins to appear on the glass.  The condensation forms because the 
wall of the jar is at or below the dew point and slightly below the air temperature inside 
the jar. 
 
Using an anti-fog solution may help to overcome any condensation that would make 
reading the thermometers difficult.  Anti-fog solutions are available commercially or as 
homemade concoctions.  As a preview activity, students might enjoy doing Internet 
research and performing a few simple experiments to find an effective homemade anti-
fog solution.  Possible agents include vinegar, liquid soap, and furniture spray polish. 
 
Experiment 1 is of shorter duration and can be performed in a single class session.  
Experiment 2 requires a longer period to demonstrate fully the influence of the water as 
a heat sink.  For middle school students, it may be possible to schedule the 
experiments across several consecutive class periods with students in each class 
continuing the work of the preceding class.  
 
Extension:  Repeat Experiment 2 using damp, moderately 
compacted potting soil in place of water as the variable.  
The soil simulates a dark landmass in contact with the 
atmosphere.  Compare results with water.
