Summary

Global warming is an important environmental issue which is rapidly becoming a part
of popular culture. This paper provides an account of the science associated with this
important issue. Historical evidence for past climate change is discussed. The difference
between weather and climate is highlighted. The physics of the greenhouse effect and
the concept of greenhouse gases are presented. The concepts of radiative forcing of
climate change and global warming potential as measures of the absolute and relative
strengths of greenhouse gases are discussed. Global warming, the enhancement of the
natural greenhouse effect caused by emissions associated with human activities of
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halogenated
compounds (e.g. CFCs and SF6), is described. Techniques used to model past, current,
and future climate are discussed. The models are based upon fundamental well
established scientific principals and incorporate the current understanding of the
complex feedback and couplings between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.

Weather and climate have a profound impact on living organisms on the planet.
Ecological systems have evolved over geological time scales to suit the prevailing
climate. The past 10 to 20 years have brought disturbing evidence that human activities
may cause significant changes in future global climate. "Global Warming" is now an
issue known to hundreds of millions of people across the world. We provide herein an
overview of the current state of knowledge concerning greenhouse gases and global
warming. For detailed scientific reviews of the subject with numerous references to the
latest technical articles the reader should consult the comprehensive IPCC reports on the
subject listed in the Bibliography. For a thought provoking historical perspective we
recommend the reader consult the articles on the greenhouse effect published by Fourier
in 1827 and Arrhenius in 1896. Our purpose here is to address the following questions:
"Is global climate changing?", "To what degree are human activities responsible for
climate change?", "What is the state of the science?", "What will future global climate
be like?" and "What should we do?".

At this point it is germane to note the difference between weather and climate. Weather
is the state of the atmosphere (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloud cover,
etc.) in a particular location at a particular time; it fluctuates greatly and is notoriously
difficult to predict. Climate is the time-averaged weather in a given geographical region.
Climate is a temporal and spatial average and is consequentially much more predictable
than weather. Thus, the average temperature during a given month in a particular area
(climate) can be predicted with some confidence, however, the temperature at a given
time and location (weather) is much more difficult to predict. Climate varies from
month to month, season to season, and year to year. Statistically significant changes in
climate occurring over a time scale of decades or longer constitute "climate change".
Climate change is not a new phenomenon in the Earth's history. The geological record
shows that when viewed over a time scale of thousands of years the climate is in a state
of more or less continual change with major ice ages occurring approximately every
100 000 years. Regular occurrence of ice ages has an astronomical origin associated
with subtle changes in the separation and relative orientation of the Earth and the Sun.
Three regular variations occur as the Earth orbits around the Sun. First, the Earth's orbit
is slightly elliptical and the eccentricity (degree to which it differs from circular) varies
with a period of approximately 100 000 years. Second, the Earth's rotational axis is
tilted with respect to its orbital axis, the tilt oscillates between 21.6o and 24.5o with a
period of approximately 41 000 years (currently the tilt is 23.5o). Third, the month when
the Earth is at perihelion (closest approach) with respect to the Sun changes with a
period of approximately 23 000 years. The three regular variations give rise to
latitudinal and seasonal variations of solar radiation intensity (up to 10% variation in
polar regions in summer time) which provides an astronomical forcing of climate
leading to ice ages in which the global average temperature is believed to be
approximately 5-10 oC cooler than at present. Currently, we are in a period between two

ice ages, in the absence of other influences we will enter another ice age over a time
scale of thousands of years. The rate of global temperature change associated with
astronomical forcing is believed to be of the order of a few tenths of a degree Celsius
per thousand years.

line in Figure 1 is the instrumental record which stretches back approximately 140
years, the blue line is the "reconstructed" temperature deduced from tree rings, ice
cores, corals, and historical records. The black curve is the 40 year smoothed average.
The temperature record for the Southern Hemisphere is less complete, but is consistent
with, that of the Northern Hemisphere. Several interesting points arise from inspection
of Figure 1. First, the average Northern hemispheric temperature is far from constant
over the past 1000 years. Many fluctuations are observed. Second, there is a small but
discernable general trend of decreasing temperature over the time period 1000–1900
with a magnitude consistent with that expected from astronomical forcing. Third, and
most significant for the present discussion, there is a pronounced and abrupt (in
geological terms) warming over the past century. Figure 2 provides a more detailed
picture over the past 140 years which shows that the warming occurred during two
periods (1910–1940 and 1980–present). The vertical bars in Figures 1 and 2 represent
the difference between the average annual temperature for each year and the average for
1961-1990. 1998 was the warmest year, the 1990s was the warmest decade, and the
1900s was the warmest century in the past millennium. The data in Figures 1 and 2
indicate that global climate is changing.
The temperature record is not the only indication of a changing climate. There are many
other indicators such as the substantial retreat of mountain glaciers in many locations
around the world, decreased snow cover in the Northern hemisphere, decreased tropical
precipitation, increased mid-to-high latitude precipitation, sea level rise, decreased
extent of Arctic ice, and thinning of Arctic ice. The combined data prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that global climate is changing.

U

N

Having concluded that global warming is indeed occurring, the next question is "Should
we be concerned?" The warming observed thus far (0.6 ± 0.2 oC since the late
nineteenth century) is modest and, in itself is unlikely to lead to a substantial global
impact. Concern regarding global warming centers on the future climate. As discussed
in detail below, it seems likely that most of the warming observed to date is associated
with human activities releasing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. In light of the
long atmospheric lifetime of carbon dioxide, substantial increases in its emission during
the past century, and expected increases in future emissions, the atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide in the year 2100 will almost certainly be substantially
greater than that today and the climate will continue to warm. The IPCC has considered
numerous emission scenarios and concluded that global temperature may rise between
1.4 and 5.8 oC by 2100 (depending on emission scenario). It is instructive to consider
Figure 1 and extrapolate a 1.4–5.8 oC increase by 2100, it is clear that when compared
to natural variability over the past 1000 years an additional 1.4–5.8 oC change in the
next 100 years would be very significant.
2. Greenhouse Effect
The history of the scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect can be traced back
to Jean Baptiste-Joseph de Fourier in 1827. Fourier suggested that the atmosphere
allows short wavelength radiation from the Sun to reach and warm the Earth's surface
but blocks emission of longer wavelength radiation which would cool the Earth. Fourier
compared this effect to that of the glass in a greenhouse (hence "greenhouse effect") and

predicted that climate could be influenced by human activities. It is now known that
prevention of the loss of warm air via convection is the main factor by which heat is
retained in a greenhouse. However, for historical reasons, the terms "greenhouse effect"
and "greenhouse gases" are still used when describing radiative trapping of heat in the
atmosphere. In 1859 John Tyndall measured the infra-red (heat) trapping ability of
water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane and suggested that ice ages were caused by
variations of the atmospheric levels of these gases. In 1896 Svante Arrhenius noted the
release of large amounts of carbon dioxide by the burning of fossil fuel and estimated
that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would warm the Earth by 5-6 oC (current
climate models predict a 1.5 – 4.5 oC rise from doubling of carbon dioxide). In 1957
Roger Revelle and Hans Suess pointed out that the build-up of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere constituted a large scale geophysical experiment whose consequences were
unknown. The following year (1958) was designated as the International Geophysical
Year and saw the start of an ongoing program of continuous measurements of
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, by Charles Keeling which
have showed that the levels of carbon dioxide are rising steadily (from 315 ppm in 1958
to 370 ppm in 2001).

U

N

It has been known for over a hundred years that water vapor, carbon dioxide, and
methane naturally present in the atmosphere trap heat in the atmosphere. It is relatively
straightforward to estimate the magnitude of this "natural greenhouse effect". Sunlight
arriving at the top of the atmosphere has a power of 1370 W m-2 (Solar Constant). The
Earth presents a disc of area πr2 (r = radius of Earth) towards the Sun and as the Earth
rotates the sunlight is distributed over a surface area of 4πr2. Hence, the 24 hour average
sunlight at the top of the atmosphere has a power of 1370/4 = 342 W m-2. Scattering by
air molecules and reflection from surfaces (e.g. by clouds and snow) return an average
of 107 W m-2 back to space leaving 235 W m-2 to heat the Earth. The only mechanism
by which the Earth can cool itself is via emission of infrared radiation into space. At
infrared frequencies the Earth behaves like a black body (when seen in IR light even
"white" clouds and snow appear "black"). Emission from a black body is given by σ ×
T4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10-8 J m-2 K-4 s-1) and T is the
temperature of the black body. Hence, at radiative equilibrium we would expect the
average surface temperature to be approximately 254 K (-19 oC). In reality the average
surface temperature of the Earth is 288 K (15 oC); the 34 oC difference is attributable to
trapping of infrared radiation (heat) in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, i.e. the
natural greenhouse effect. Without the natural greenhouse effect the planet would be
permanently frozen and devoid of life. "Global warming" refers to the enhanced
greenhouse effect expected to result from an increase in atmospheric concentration of
greenhouse gases resulting from emissions associated with human activities.

U

N

Absorption of infrared irradiation by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been well
documented by satellite observations. Figure 3 shows the infrared radiation observed by
a satellite looking down on the Sahara Desert. The dotted lines show emission spectra
expected from blackbodies at various temperatures. The atmosphere is transparent at
wavelengths of 10-12 μm (800-1000 cm-1), infrared radiation at this wavelength
reaching the satellite comes directly from the surface of sand grains in the Sahara which
have a temperature of 320 K (47 oC). The 10-12 μm region is known as the atmospheric
window region. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the infrared radiation on either side of
the atmospheric window is characteristic of emission from a blackbody which is
significantly cooler than 320 K. Thus, for example the intensity of radiation at
wavelengths around 15 μm is characteristic of that expected from a blackbody at
approximately 220 K. The apparent discrepancy between the temperature inferred from
the 10-12 μm and 15 μm radiation is explained by the fact that carbon dioxide absorbs
strongly at 15 μm. Hence, at 15 μm the satellite does not observe emission from the
Earth's surface but instead observes emission from high in the atmosphere where the
temperatures are much colder than at the surface and the emission much weaker. Water
vapor, ozone, and methane are also strong absorbers of infrared radiation. As indicated
in Figure 3, the presence of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevents the
direct escape of terrestrial infrared radiation into space. Increases in the atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and
ozone will act to further hinder the escape of terrestrial infrared radiation and hence
warm the Earth's surface. Certain industrial gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and
the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are powerful absorbers in the atmospheric window
region and have a particularly pronounced greenhouse effect (on a mass basis SF6 is
22 200 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide). To understand the

potential for human induced global warming we need to consider the human
contribution to greenhouse gas levels.

The three most powerful long lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon
dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. In this section the sources, sinks, and atmospheric
concentrations of these compounds are considered. In addition we will consider the
class of compounds known as halogenated organic compounds (of which CFCs are a
subset), SF6, and ozone in the lower and upper atmosphere. At this point it is germane to
note that water vapor is the single most powerful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.
Water vapor has approximately twice the effect of the second most powerful greenhouse
gas—carbon dioxide. Human activities do not have any significant direct impact on the
level of water vapor in the atmosphere. However, as a result of global warming it is
likely that human activities will have a significant indirect impact on the level of water
vapor in the atmosphere. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas and the
development of a better understanding of the effect of global warming on atmospheric
water in all its forms (solid, liquid, and gas) is of critical importance.

U

Figure 4 shows the concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the
atmosphere over the past 1000 years as measured in air trapped in bubbles in ice core
samples from sites in Antarctica and Greenland and, for the more recent data, measured
directly in ambient air. The units for carbon dioxide concentration are parts per million
(ppm) while those for methane and nitrous oxide are parts per billion (ppb), 1 ppm =
1000 ppb. The current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is 370 ppm,
meaning that in samples of one million molecules of ambient air we would expect to
find, on average, 370 molecules of carbon dioxide. As seen from Figure 4, the overall
trend of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide concentrations is the same. For the
time period 1000–1800 there is little, or no, discernable change, while over the period
1800–2000 there is a substantial increase in the atmospheric levels of all three gases. It
is well established that the increases in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide,
methane, and nitrous oxide during 1800–2000 reflect the impact of human activities in
general and the industrial revolution in particular.
3.1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

Discussion of the human impact on the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
atmosphere is complicated by two factors. First, emissions of CO2 associated with
human activities, while large on a human scale, are small when compared to natural
fluxes of CO2 associated with photosynthesis, respiration, uptake into ocean water, and
release from ocean water. Second, there are several large reservoirs of CO2 (e.g.
atmosphere, upper ocean, deep ocean, biosphere) which are continually exchanging
CO2. In such a system one needs to be very careful when using the words "source",
"sink", and "lifetime". Instead of "source" and "sink" it is often better to refer to "net
source" and "net sink". Thus, the oceans are both a large (90 GtC yr-1) source and a
large (92 GtC yr-1) sink of atmospheric CO2. Overall the oceans provide a net sink for
CO2 of 2 GtC yr-1. The unit used to measure CO2 flux is GtC which stands for Giga
(109) tonnes of carbon. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44 while the atomic weight of

carbon is 12, hence the mass of CO2 corresponding to 1 GtC is actually (44/12) = 3.7
Gt. With continual exchange between reservoirs it is not possible to specify a single
atmospheric lifetime for CO2. The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is typically quoted as
approximately 100 years. For simplicity the discussion below will not consider the
natural fluxes of carbon between the various reservoirs in the environment; instead it
will focus on the human perturbation to the natural cycle.

Figure 4. Atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
nitrous oxide (N2O) over the past 1000 years. Different symbols are measurements
using ice cores from different sites in Antarctica and Greenland. The straight line in the
CO2 plot are the recent in-situ atmospheric measurements. The curve through the CH4
data is a smoothed fit. (Reproduced with permission from IPCC)

Four approaches have been used to estimate the net CO2 flux between atmosphere,
oceans, and terrestrial biosphere: (i) direct local flux measurements which are
extrapolated globally (ii) indirect assessment using atmospheric models calibrated, or
partially validated, using various tracers (iii) monitoring of tracers coupled to the CO2
cycle such as ratios of molecules containing different carbon isotopes, e.g. 13CO2/12CO2,
14
CO2/12CO2, and (iv) measurements of the change in atmospheric CO2 concentrations
as air passes over a particular region combined with "inverse" modeling to estimate the
fluxes necessary to account for the observed changes. Such techniques have been used
to estimate that the oceans remove 2.0±0.8 GtC yr-1 and re-growth of forests in the
Northern Hemisphere removes 0.5±0.5 GtC yr-1 of CO2 from the atmosphere. Human

activities are believed to lead to emission of 5.5±0.5 GtC yr-1 from fossil fuel
combustion and cement production and emission of 1.6±1.0 GtC yr-1 from changes in
tropical land use (deforestation). The atmospheric burden of CO2 is increasing at a rate
of 3.3±0.2 GtC yr-1. To balance the CO2 budget "unknown terrestrial sinks" have been
invoked and have been inferred to account for 1.3±1.5 GtC yr-1 of CO2. This is often
known as the "missing sink". It should be noted that zero lies within the range 1.3±1.5
and hence there may indeed be no "missing sink" (see Oxides of Carbon).

It should be noted that a highly simplified picture has been presented above. In reality
the carbon cycle is very complex with a number of important feedback loops. One direct
carbon cycle feedback is that certain agricultural and wild plant and tree species have
shown significantly higher growth under higher (typically doubled) carbon dioxide
concentrations. Growth is also strongly influenced by nutrient and water availability as
well as other stress factors (temperature, insect attacks etc.). For terrestrial systems
CO2-climate feedbacks include effects of temperature, precipitation and radiation
changes (changes in cloudiness) on primary production and decomposition. For marine
systems feedback occurs through climatic influences on ocean circulation and
chemistry. Rates of biological activity generally increase with warmer temperatures and
increasing moisture. The feedbacks of changing carbon dioxide and climate on
ecosystems are many and complex and will not be discussed here.
The current (2001) atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is 370 ppm and increasing
at approximately 1.5 ppm per year. As shown in Figure 4 this level is 30% above that
observed in pre-industrial times (280 ppm). The ice core record from Vostok in
Antarctica shows that the current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is
substantially greater than at anytime in at least the past 420 000 years.
3.3. Methane (CH4)

U

N

Methane (CH4) is the most abundant well mixed greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. In
contrast to carbon dioxide, methane is removed from the atmosphere via chemical
reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals. Methane plays an important role in atmospheric
chemistry and it can influence the levels of other important trace species via its reaction
with OH. All other factors being constant, increased atmospheric levels of methane will
result in decreased concentrations of OH and hence a longer lifetime for any gas whose
atmospheric lifetime is influenced by reaction with OH. Also, an increase in methane
will lead to the production of more tropospheric ozone which is an important
greenhouse gas. Methane is involved in complex feedback loops in atmospheric
chemistry (see Hydrocarbons in the Atmosphere and Gas-Phase (Photo-)Chemical
Processes in the Troposphere).

Methane is emitted into the atmosphere by a large number of natural and anthropogenic
sources. Natural sources are believed to contribute approximately 30% of the methane
flux while anthropogenic sources account for the remaining 70%. Natural sources are
estimated to contribute a total of approximately 160 Tg(CH4) yr-1 (1Tg= 1012 g, 1000 Tg
= 1Gt). The largest natural sources are wetlands, termites, and oceans which emit 115,
20, and 10 Tg(CH4) yr-1, respectively. Anthropogenic sources are natural gas facilities,
coal mines, petroleum industry, coal combustion, enteric fermentation, rice paddies,

biomass burning, landfills, animal waste, domestic sewage and are estimated to emit 40,
30, 15, 15, 85, 60, 40, 40, 25 and 25 Tg(CH4) yr-1, respectively, for a total
anthropogenic contribution of 375 Tg(CH4) yr-1. The identified sources total
approximately 535 Tg(CH4) yr-1.

Methane is removed from the atmosphere through reaction with OH radicals in the
troposphere and stratosphere with rates estimated to be 445 and 40 Tg(CH4) yr-1,
respectively. The tropospheric lifetime with respect to the OH radical reaction is
approximately 12 years. CH4 fluxes in the terrestrial and marine systems are highly
variable; the soil sink is estimated to 30 Tg(CH4) yr-1. The sinks for methane total
approximately 515 Tg(CH4) yr-1. Over the past 25 years the annual growth rate of the
atmospheric concentration of methane has varied substantially between 0 and 15 ppb yr1
, corresponding to increases in the atmospheric burden of between 0 and 40 Tg yr-1.
There is no quantitative understanding of the variation in rate of increase in the
atmospheric methane concentration over the past few decades. As seen from Figure 4, it
is clear that during the time period 1000 – 1750 there was little, or no, change in the
global atmospheric methane concentration, but since 1750 there has been a substantial
(150%) increase in the concentration of this greenhouse gas.
3.4. Nitrous Oxide (N2O)

U

N

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most abundant well mixed greenhouse gas after carbon
dioxide and methane. N2O is a long-lived (130 years) trace constituent of the lower
atmosphere present in a concentration which is currently 313 ppb and increasing at a
rate of 0.5-0.9 ppb yr-1. As seen from Figure 4, the atmospheric concentration of N2O
has increased by approximately 16% since pre-industrial times. In addition to its
importance as a greenhouse gas, N2O is transported through the troposphere into the
stratosphere where it reacts with O(1D) atoms and is the source of stratospheric NOx
(O(1D) atoms are electronically excited oxygen atoms). Natural sources of N2O
associated with emission from soils and the oceans are estimated to deliver 10.2 TgN yr1
to the atmosphere. Anthropogenic emissions of N2O are associated with biomass
burning, fossil fuel combustion, industrial production of adipic and nitric acids, and the
use of nitrogen fertilizer, and are believed to total 3.2 TgN yr-1. Photodissociation in the
stratosphere is the major (90%) loss mechanism for N2O in the atmosphere. Reaction
with O(1D) atoms is a minor (10%) loss of N2O (see Reduced and Oxidized Nitrogen).
3.5. Halogenated Organic Compounds

Halogenated organic compounds are organic compounds containing one or more
halogen atoms. Halogenated organic compounds can be fully substituted where all of
the hydrogens in the molecule have been replaced by halogen atoms, or partially
substituted where some hydrogens remain. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are two subsets of halogenated organic compounds in which
all hydrogen atoms have been substituted by fluorine and chlorine atoms, or solely by
fluorine atoms. CFC-12 (CCl2F2) and CFC-11 (CCl3F) are the two most abundant CFCs
in the atmosphere and are present at levels of 0.5 and 0.25 ppb, respectively. CF4 is the
most abundant PFC and is found at a concentration of 0.08 ppb in the atmosphere.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrofluorochlorocarbons (HCFCs) are compounds in

©Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (EOLSS)

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY - Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming - Timothy J. Wallington,
Jayaraman Srinivasan, Ole John Nielsen, Ellie J. Highwood

which some, but not all, of the hydrogens have been replaced with fluorine (HFCs) or
fluorine and chlorine atoms (HCFCs). Halons are a class of compounds containing
bromine and chlorine (but no hydrogen). There are no significant natural sources of
CFCs, PFCs, HFCs, HCFCs, or Halons. These compounds were not present in the preindustrial atmosphere, and their presence in contemporary air reflects emissions
associated with industrial activities (see Ecological Chemistry, Chemistry of Organic
Pollutants, including Agrochemicals, and Multimedia Fate and Transport of Organic
Pollutants).

Carbon-halogen bonds (e.g. C-F, C-Cl, C-Br) absorb strongly at infrared wavelengths
and this is why halogenated organic compounds are strong greenhouse gases. The
effectiveness of these compounds as greenhouse gases depends on two factors: (i) the
number of carbon-halogen bonds in the molecule and (ii) the atmospheric lifetime of the
molecule. In general, the atmospheric lifetime of organic compounds is dictated by their
reactivity towards OH (hydroxyl) radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are essentially unreactive
towards C-F, C-Cl, and C-Br bonds and hence increasing halogenation of the molecule
increases the atmospheric lifetime and the greenhouse strength of the molecule. PFCs
have lifetimes of the order of thousands of years while CFCs and Halons persist for
typically 50-100 years. By contrast HFCs and HCFCs have relatively short atmospheric
lifetimes ranging typically from a few months to a decade (depending on the particular
compound). Recognition of the adverse environmental impact of CFCs and Halons on
stratospheric ozone has led to international controls on the use of these chemicals.
Under the Montreal Protocol the production of CFCs and Halons are being phased out
and these compounds are being replaced by HFCs and HCFCs. While release of CFCs
and Halons from existing equipment continues, the rate of such release has decreased
substantially and the atmospheric concentration of such compounds is beginning to
decline. With accelerating use of HFCs and HCFCs over the past 10-20 years the levels
of these compounds in the atmosphere have increased substantially, HCFC-22 (CHF2Cl)
is the most abundant at a concentration of 0.1 ppb, while HFC-23 (CF3H), HCFC-141b
(CFCl2CH3), HCFC-142b (CF2ClCH3), and HFC-134a (CF3CFH2) are each present at a
concentration of approximately 0.01 – 0.02 ppb.
3.5. Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6)

On a per molecule basis, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is one of the most potent greenhouse
gases known. Its potency stems from its intense absorption at 10.3 μm (969 cm-1) in the
atmospheric window region (see Figure 3) and its extremely long atmospheric lifetime
of 3200 years. SF6 is present in small amounts in fluorites and degassing from these
minerals provides a small natural source which results in a natural background
concentration of 0.01 ppt. SF6 is a useful industrial chemical used as an insulating gas in
electrical switching equipment. As a result of anthropogenic emissions the current level
of SF6 in the atmosphere is approximately 400 times that of the natural background and
increasing at a rate of approximately 0.2 ppt yr-1. Very recently a new SF6-like
greenhouse gas was detected in the atmosphere: SF5CF3. The level of SF5CF3 in the
global atmosphere increased from essentially zero in 1960 to 0.12 ppt in 1999. While
the concentration of SF5CF3 is very low and this compound does not play any
significant role in global warming it is of interest because on a per molecule basis it is
the most potent greenhouse gas yet identified in the atmosphere. The discovery of

SF5CF3 illustrates that there is much that is still to be learnt concerning such greenhouse
gases. While it is unlikely that any single major greenhouse gas awaits discovery, the
possibility that many compounds such as SF5CF3 are present, with each making a small
contribution that when summed represent a non-negligible contribution cannot be ruled
out at present.

Prior to discussing the relationship between ozone and global climate change it is useful
to provide a brief background on the atmospheric chemistry of ozone. In contrast to all
other greenhouse gases, ozone is not emitted into the atmosphere. Ozone is generated
in-situ in the atmosphere from two processes: (i) photolysis of molecular oxygen (O2)
which gives oxygen atoms (O) which then add to molecular oxygen to give ozone (O3)
and (ii) oxidation of organic compounds (from natural and man-made sources) in the
presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The first process only occurs in the upper
atmosphere where there is sufficient short wavelength sunlight to photodissociate
molecular oxygen and this process gives rise to the stratospheric ozone layer at altitudes
of 20-50 km. The second process occurs throughout the atmosphere but, because of the
much greater availability of organic compounds and NOx near the Earth's surface, is
much more important in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). Emission of large amounts
of organic compounds and NOx in urban areas leads to the formation of substantial
amounts of ozone in, and downwind of, large metropolitan centers around the world. In
discussions of the climatic impact of human perturbations of atmospheric ozone levels a
clear distinction must be made between ozone in the upper atmosphere (stratospheric
ozone), which has decreased as a result of human activities, and ozone in the lower
atmosphere (tropospheric ozone) which has increased as a result of human activities.
Finally, in contrast to all other greenhouse gases considered here, the atmospheric
lifetime of ozone is short (of the order of days or weeks, depending on local conditions)
and hence its concentration responds quickly to changes in atmospheric conditions.
Ozone concentrations in the lower atmosphere are typically 10-100 ppb with levels at
the low end of the range being characteristic of remote pristine environments and levels
at the high end of the range being typical of polluted urban air masses (see Tropospheric
Ozone Pollution, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion).
As indicated in Figure 5 and discussed in the next section, the depletion of stratospheric
ozone during the period 1979-2000 (caused by the release of CFCs and subsequent
chemical reactions) has led to a negative radiative forcing of climate which is estimated
to have a magnitude of -0.15 W m-2. International agreements are now in place which
should eliminate the emission of CFCs over the next few decades. It is expected that the
stratospheric ozone layer will recover during the twenty-first century and that the
magnitude of the negative radiative forcing associated with stratospheric ozone loss will
decrease with time.

It is believed that the levels of ozone in the troposphere have increased by 30-40% since
1750 due to increased emission of organic compounds and NOx. This increased
concentration of tropospheric ozone has contributed a positive radiative forcing of 0.35
W m-2 (see Figure 5). The forcing associated with tropospheric ozone varies
substantially by region and season and will respond quickly to changes in emissions of
ozone forming compounds.
4. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change

U

N

Net radiation is defined as the difference between the solar radiation absorbed by the
Earth-atmosphere system and the longwave radiation emitted by the Earth-atmosphere
system to space. Net radiation influences the Earth's climate because it determines the
energy available for heating the atmosphere, ocean and land. Hence net radiation
influences the seasonal variation of rainfall and the strength of the global circulation
patterns. When greenhouse gases increase in the atmosphere on account of human
activities, the radiative balance of the Earth is altered. The greenhouse gases absorb the
longwave radiation emitted by the Earth but are transparent to the radiation coming
from the sun. Hence the increase in greenhouse gases causes an increase in the net
radiation at the top of the atmosphere. The change in net radiation at the tropopause
caused by changes in greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations is called radiative
forcing. Radiative forcing can be calculated accurately if the temperature profile and the
concentration of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is known. Radiative forcing
depends upon how strongly a greenhouse gas absorbs radiation and the location of its
absorption bands. As discussed in section 2 and illustrated in Figure 3, the radiation
emitted by the Earth-atmosphere system is at its maximum around in the wavelength
region 10-12 microns (1 micron = 10-6 meter). If the absorption band of a greenhouse
gas is located in this region then it will tend to have a high radiative forcing. On the
other hand, if the absorption lies in a region in which there is already strong absorption

by greenhouse gases presently in the atmosphere (for example at around 15 μm where
CO2 absorbs, see Figure 3) then it will have a low radiative forcing. This later effect
explains why increases in atmospheric CO2 levels have a radiative forcing effect which
are small (on a molecule for molecule basis) relative to the effect of other greenhouse
gases. During the calculation of radiative forcing one must account for the overlap
between the absorption bands of different greenhouse gases. Some gases, such as CFC12 (CCl2F2), can cause direct as well as indirect radiative forcing. The direct radiative
forcing of CFC-12 is positive since it has an absorption band in the infrared region. The
indirect radiative forcing associated with CFC-12 is negative because emission of CFC12 leads to the loss of stratospheric ozone with a resulting cooling effect (see
Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Pollution).

How do we compare the radiative impact of different greenhouse gases released by
human beings? Chlorofluorocarbons absorb much more longwave radiation than carbon
dioxide on a per molecule basis. The change in atmospheric abundance of
chlorofluorocarbons has, however, been much smaller than that of carbon dioxide. To
compare the effect of different gases with different abundance and different capability
to absorb longwave radiation it is most appropriate to compare their impact on net
radiation at the tropopause (boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, located
at approximately 10-15 km). Since pre-industrial times the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere has increased from 278 ppm to 370 ppm and resulted in a radiative
forcing change of approximately 1.46 W m-2. The amount of methane in the atmosphere
has increased from 700 ppb (in pre-industrial times) to 1700 ppb at present and has
resulted in a radiative forcing change of 0.47 W m-2. On the other hand, the amount of
CFC-12 has increased from 0 to 0.5 ppb since pre-industrial times and resulted in a
radiative forcing change of 0.14 W m-2. Radiative forcing is a measure of the effect of
different greenhouse gases or aerosols on radiative balance at the tropopause. Note that
the radiative forcing due to increased carbon dioxide is three times as large as that
caused by the increase in methane and eleven times as large as that due to CFC-12.
Hence, it can be inferred that carbon dioxide is more important than methane or CFC-12
as regards its impact on global warming. It is reasonable to conclude that attempts to
significantly reduce global warming should include a reduction of carbon dioxide
emissions from human activities. To evaluate the long-term impact of emission of
greenhouse gases we need information about the residence times of greenhouse gases
emitted on account of human activities. A gas with a long residence time will have a
greater impact on future climate than a gas with a short residence time even if the
radiative forcing of the two gases is the same. The atmospheric lifetime of carbon
dioxide is around 100 years while that of methane is around 12 years. To assist policy
makers to understand the potential impact on climate of different greenhouse gases, the
concept of Global Warming Potential (GWP) has been introduced. This concept
compares the potential impact of different greenhouse gases using carbon dioxide as a
reference greenhouse gas. The use of carbon dioxide as a reference greenhouse gas is
logical since it is the most important greenhouse gas associated with human activities.
Global Warming Potential (GWP) is defined as the ratio of the time integrated radiative
forcing from instantaneous release of one kilogram of a substance relative to that of one
kilogram of carbon dioxide (CO2) and can be defined as:

where t is the time horizon (typically 20, 100, or 500 years) over which the integration
is performed, RF is the radiative forcing (calculated change in radiation flux at the
tropopause) resulting from a unit increase in the atmospheric concentration of a given
species and has units of W m-2 ppb-1, [x(t)] and [CO2(t)] are concentrations (in units of
ppb) of x and CO2 as a function of time following instantaneous release of 1 kg of each
substance. It should be noted that radiative forcing is an absolute measure of the
strength of a greenhouse gas on a per volume basis, while GWP is a relative measure on
a per mass basis. GWP values for several long-lived greenhouse gases are listed in
Table 1. The values given in Table 1 reflect the relative efficiency (on a per mass basis)
by which the various gases trap infrared radiation (heat) in the atmosphere. Thus, a
given mass of SF6 over a 100 year time horizon is 22 200 times more efficient at
trapping infrared radiation than is the same mass of CO2. It can be seen from Table 1
that the GWP values change with the time horizon that is considered. The GWPs of
some compounds increase with increasing time horizon (e.g. SF6) while that of others
decrease with increasing time horizon (e.g. methane). This different behavior is a
reflection of whether the atmospheric lifetimes are longer (e.g. SF6), or shorter (e.g.
methane) than that of CO2.

As discussed in the previous section, changes in greenhouse gases over the past 250
years have produced a positive radiative forcing (2.5 W m-2 since 1750) on climate.
Research has been focused on these gases as the main culprits of global warming.
However, in recent years it has become obvious that many other mechanisms, both
natural and anthropogenic, can also produce significant radiative forcings. Figure 5
shows the global mean radiative forcing due to changes in greenhouse gases and these
other mechanisms since 1750. As shown in Figure 5, the level of scientific
understanding of many of these forcings is well below that of greenhouse gases. We
now consider four sources of radiative forcing other than greenhouse gases: aerosols,
land use changes, solar variability and volcanic eruptions. Those due to changes in
aerosols and land use have anthropogenic components, while the last two are entirely
natural forcings.
5.1. Aerosols

Aerosols are tiny sub-micron particles (e.g. soot, mineral dust) or tiny droplets (e.g.
sulfuric acid or organic compounds) that are either emitted directly into the atmosphere
(primary aerosols) or formed from emitted gases during chemical reactions (secondary
aerosols). They result from human activities such as fossil fuel burning, transport
emissions, biomass burning and land use changes, but are also produced naturally by
vegetation, marine algae, volcanoes and high wind stress over naturally arid regions (see
Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Pollution, Suspended Material / Aerosols, Formation
and Effects of Smog).

U

N

Aerosols can affect climate in two main ways. Firstly, they can affect the radiation
balance of the Earth—the so-called “direct” effect. Most aerosols reflect incoming solar
radiation back to space thereby preventing it reaching the Earth's surface. In this way,
increases in the amount of sulfates in the atmosphere have produced a negative forcing
of –0.5 W m-2 during the past 250 years (as shown in Figure 5). An additional negative
forcing has also come from extra droplets of organic compounds from fossil fuel and
biomass burning. Some types of aerosol, such as black carbon (soot), also absorb solar
radiation, trapping energy in the troposphere. Increases in soot resulting from fossil fuel
burning have produced a positive radiative forcing (approximately 0.3 W m-2) since
1750. Increased biomass burning in the past 250 years has caused a radiative forcing of
around –0.25 W m-2 (biomass aerosol is a combination of sulfates, organic carbon and
soot). Larger particles like dust can also absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth,
preventing it reaching space and therefore acting something like a greenhouse gas. This
effect is highly dependent on the surface over which the aerosol lies and so the size and
even the sign of radiative forcing due to recent dust changes is uncertain.
Some types of aerosol can also have an “indirect” effect on climate. The particles can
act as cloud condensation nuclei, altering the number of droplets in a cloud and
therefore its lifetime and brightness. These cloud changes then affect the amount of

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY - Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming - Timothy J. Wallington,
Jayaraman Srinivasan, Ole John Nielsen, Ellie J. Highwood

radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. During the past 250 years, these effects are
thought to have resulted in a negative radiative forcing, the magnitude of which could
be (on a global mean scale) nearly as large as the total positive greenhouse gas radiative
forcing over the same period of time. However, since we know relatively little about the
interaction between aerosols and clouds, the final result is very uncertain. Additionally,
some aerosols can provide surfaces on which chemical reactions can occur.

In Figure 5 the global mean radiative forcing due to aerosols (except for the indirect
effect) appears much smaller than that due to greenhouse gases. This is somewhat
misleading because the natures of the two forcings are completely different. Most
aerosols can only survive in the atmosphere for a few weeks and so concentrations are
only high close to the sources. Thus the radiative forcing is also highly geographically
variable (the distribution of radiative forcing due to past changes in sulfate aerosol is
shown in Figure 6a). As seen from Figure 6a, sulfate aerosol exerts a large local
negative forcing (up to –5 W m-2) over parts of Asia, but exerts essentially no effect
over the majority of the Earth's surface. In contrast, carbon dioxide has a long
atmospheric lifetime, is mixed more uniformly around the globe, and as a consequence
the forcing due to increased carbon dioxide is much more uniform (see Figure 6b).

The implication here is that it is far too simplistic to think that the effect of aerosols
cancels out the positive radiative forcing produced by greenhouse gases. In an
analogous fashion a man standing with one foot in boiling water and the other in ice
water cannot be said to be on average comfortable. The radiative forcing due to aerosol
is highly dependent on type, mixture, relative humidity, size and underlying surface, all
of which are currently less than adequately characterized.

Anthropogenic land use changes due to agricultural practices, deforestation,
overgrazing, desertification, and urbanization lead to a change in the surface
characteristics of the Earth. Over the past 250 years, such changes have led to an
increase in albedo (the fraction of incoming radiation returned to space via scattering by
gas molecules and reflection by clouds and at the Earth's surface). Over the past 250
years land use changes have produced a negative global mean radiative forcing of –0.2
W m-2 (see Figure 5). Human induced land use change may also indirectly cause other
radiative forcings, such as an increased atmospheric aerosol loading. These effects
currently remain unquantified.
5.3. Solar Variability

U

N

Climate can be affected both by changes in the Sun-Earth orbital parameters such as
axis tilt, Sun-Earth distance and the obliquity of the orbit. However, these typically vary
on timescales of thousands of years and so are generally not thought to have played a
major role in climate change over the past 250 years. The total amount of energy
emitted by the Sun (or the total solar irradiance, TSI) varies on much shorter timescales,
particularly having a prominent 11 year cycle. Periods of higher than usual emission are
characterized by the appearance of dark sunspots surrounded by bright faculae.
Historically, the Little Ice Age of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries coincided with
the total disappearance of sunspots, indicating that the TSI was very low. It is generally
thought that changes in TSI might have been largely responsible for the warming
observed in the first half of the twentieth century but could not alone be responsible for
the warming in the second half of the twentieth century. Over the past 250 years, solar
variability has produced a positive global mean radiative forcing of around 0.3 W m-2.
5.4. Volcanic Activity

Large explosive volcanic eruptions such as that of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillipines
during 1991 are capable of putting vast amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into the
stratosphere. Here it is converted into sulfuric acid aerosol. Since it is above the
weather, this aerosol can remain in the stratosphere for two to three years, and for a
tropical eruption, can be spread quickly around the globe by the winds (see Sulfur
Dioxide and Sulfur Cycles). The aerosol scatters solar radiation back to space (causing
the surface to cool) and absorbs some solar and long wave radiation (causing the
stratosphere to warm). The Pinatubo eruption produced a peak global mean radiative
forcing of around -4 W m-2, and the surface and stratospheric temperatures remained

altered by a few tenths of a degree for up to 4 years after the eruption. Individual
eruptions give a transient effect on climate and have limited long term effects. It is
therefore difficult to compare their radiative forcing with the other mechanisms shown
in Figure 5. However, the cumulative effect of several eruptions during active volcanic
periods could produce a prolonged effect on climate. The difference in radiative forcing
on comparing an active and quiet decade could be as much as 1 W m-2.

How do we predict the impact of increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols on future
climate? This can only be achieved using climate models. In atmospheric climate
models the entire atmosphere of the Earth is divided into a large number of small boxes.
The typical dimensions of these cubes are 200 kilometers in longitude, 200 kilometers
in latitude and 1 kilometer in height. Hence a typical climate model has about 400 000
such boxes! The temperature and winds in each box is calculated using the physical
laws governing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The moisture content
is calculated by ensuring the conservation of water in all its forms (liquid, solid and
vapor) in each box. It is not possible to provide analytical solutions to the equations in
the models and so a numerical computational approach is used. Since the number of
computations involved is very large these climate models require super-computers. The
models used for short-term weather forecasting are similar to those used to predict
future climate change. For weather forecasting accurate initial values are needed to
predict the weather for the next few days. For predicting future climate change, the
atmospheric models need information about how the surface temperature of the ocean
will evolve. The variation of surface temperature of the ocean can be predicted by ocean
climate models. These models are similar to atmospheric climate models and use the
laws of conservation of mass, momentum, energy and salinity. If the atmospheric and
ocean models are run together they are called coupled models. In such models changes
in atmospheric winds will alter the surface temperature of the ocean which in turn will
alter the atmospheric winds. These models are run for hundreds of years to predict how
the climate of the atmosphere and ocean will evolve together. They have been used to
understand how the climate has changed over the last hundred years and predict how
they will change during the next hundred years. They are able to accurately simulate the
observed increase in global mean temperature during the past hundred years. When
these models are used to predict changes in global mean temperature over the next
hundred years, they show significant differences. One reason for the variations in model
predictions of future climate is the different treatment of clouds. The representation of
clouds in climate models is problematic because we are not able to spatially resolve
clouds in the models and we lack sufficient observations of the different types of clouds
and their physical properties. Hence different modeling groups have represented clouds
and their impact on climate in different ways in their climate models.
Over the past decade the sophistication of global scale climate models has increased
markedly as our understanding of the complexities of the climate system has grown.
This trend is likely to continue. The increasing power of computer systems will make it
possible to include more detailed descriptions and interactions between atmosphere,
ocean, sea-ice, sulfate aerosol, non-sulfate aerosol, clouds, land use, and atmospheric
chemistry in future climate models and will necessitate a much greater understanding of

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY - Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming - Timothy J. Wallington,

these processes and phenomena. Moore's Law states that the power of computer systems
will double every 18 months. Computer experts believe that Moore's Law will hold over
the next 10-20 years. Hence, over the next two decades the computing power available
to run global climate models is expected to increase by a factor of 10 000. The
observational global climate record received by satellites will improve substantially in
both quantity and quality over the coming decades. With the confluence of the
availability of dramatically more powerful computer systems, a better climate record to
test and calibrate the models, and improved scientific understanding of climate change it
seems reasonable to expect that during the next 10-20 years there will be substantial
improvements in our ability to predict the likely magnitude, timing, and consequences
of global climate change.

7. Predictions of Future Climate

U

N

To predict any future event certain assumptions must be made. Predictions of future
climate are based upon two main assumptions. First, estimates of future anthropogenic
forcing of climate (e.g. emission rates of greenhouse gases, land use changes, aerosol
emissions). Second, the validity of climate models used to relate climate to changes in
anthropogenic forcings. With regard to both the likely magnitude of future
anthropogenic forcing of climate and the validity of climate models it is necessary to
rely on expert judgment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is
widely acknowledged as the most authoritative source of expert judgment in this field
(see Bibliography). The IPCC considered greenhouse gas emission scenarios arising
from a range of population, economic, cultural, social, and technological trends over the
next century and incorporated these scenarios in state-of-the-art climate models. The
results from models using 35 different emission scenarios project that the global average
annual temperature will increase by 1.4 to 5.8 oC over the period 1990 to 2100 (in
addition to the 0.6 oC warming since 1860). Experts at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have used quantitative uncertainty techniques to assign probabilities to
various scenarios and have reported a median value of 2.5 oC for the average global
surface temperature rise over the period 1990 to 2100 with a 95% confidence interval of
0.9 - 4.8 oC. In a similar analysis experts at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colorado, have estimated with 90% confidence that the warming
will lie in the range 1.7 – 4.9 oC with a median value of 3.07 – 3.18oC (depending on
probability distribution assumptions). With our current level of scientific understanding
we expect that in the absence of climate change mitigation policies the global average
surface temperature will most probably increase by 2.5 – 3.2 oC over the period 1990 to
2100. To place a global warming of 2.5 – 3.2 oC into perspective, it is instructive to
return to Figure 1 and compare this temperature change to that of the natural variability
in the climate system. It should be noted that the entire y-axis scale in Figure 1 spans 2
o
C. A warming of 2.5 – 3.2 oC by 2100 would be very significant. Global climate
models project higher maximum temperatures, more hot days, higher minimum
temperatures, fewer cold days, fewer frost days, and reduced diurnal temperature
variation over essentially all land areas.

Figure 7 shows the changes in average annual temperature (A) and precipitation (B)
over the next 50 years predicted using a state-of-the-art climate model (Hadley Center,
U.K. Meteorological. Office, see bibliography) assuming an increase in greenhouse gas
concentrations equivalent to about a 1% increase per year of carbon dioxide. As seen
from Figure 7A, the predicted warming is not geographically uniform. Land areas will
warm substantially (up to a factor of 2) more than the global average while ocean areas
(with greater thermal inertia) will warm significantly less than the global average. High
latitudes (particularly in the Northern Hemisphere) will experience the most intense
warming. This effect reflects the importance of the ice-albedo feedback, where the
melting of snow and ice will decrease the local albedo (reflectivity) and thereby
increase the heating from sunlight. Interestingly, some geographical areas (see Figure
7A) are expected to actually cool as a result of global warming. The explanation for this
paradoxical result lies in the complexities of the climate system. The North Atlantic
receives a substantial amount of heat transported from lower latitudes by the Gulf
Stream. Ocean models predict that Global Warming will weaken the Gulf Stream,

In a warmer world there will be more evaporation and hence more precipitation. Figure
7B shows changes in precipitation predicted over the next 50 years. While most areas
are expected to receive more precipitation than at present, there are large areas which
are expected to receive less precipitation. Interestingly, in general, the areas that are
predicted to experience reduced precipitation are those in which supplies of fresh water
are limited (e.g. Northern Africa, Indian sub-continent, Australia). The global
hydrological cycle is expected to be more vigorous with more intense precipitation
events. Increased continental drying and increased risk of drought is predicted in mid
latitudes.
Prediction of the future global climate is perhaps one of the greatest scientific
challenges of the twenty-first century. It is difficult to imagine a more complex or
important system than that of climate. Human activities are increasing the levels of
important greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the
atmosphere to levels which have never been seen before in human history, we are quite
literally entering uncharted territory. Climate models are the only available tools to
predict future climate. The models are based upon fundamental well established
scientific principals and incorporate our current understanding of the complex feedback
and couplings between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. With our current
level of scientific understanding we expect that over the next century the world will
warm substantially.
8. Conclusions

U

N

At the beginning of this chapter the following questions were posed: "Is global climate
changing?”, "To what degree are human activities responsible for climate change?",
"What is the state of the science?", "What will future global climate be like?" and "What
should we do?". In the light of the discussion in the previous sections we are now in a
position to provide answers to these questions.

"Is global climate changing?" The answer to this question is "Yes". There is a large
body of scientific data that shows beyond any reasonable doubt that the global climate
has warmed significantly over the past 150 years. Probably the most compelling
evidence for global warming comes from the temperature record shown in Figures 1 and
2. However, this data is by no means the only indication of a change in climate. In
addition, observed retreat of glaciers around the world, decreased snow cover in the
Northern hemisphere, decreased tropical precipitation, increased mid-to-high latitude
precipitation, sea level rise, increased ocean temperature, decreased extent of Arctic ice,
and decreased thickness of Arctic ice all point to a warming global climate. The
combined data prove beyond any reasonable doubt that there has been a definite
warming trend in global climate over the past century. It is important to stress that the
warming trend is in "global climate", not "local climate" or "global weather". Thus,
neither a long term cooler climate in restricted geographical areas, nor a decrease in
average global temperature from one year to the next should be viewed as inconsistent
with the overall warming trend.

"To what degree are human activities responsible for climate change?" The answer to
this somewhat controversial question is "It is very likely that human activities are
responsible for a substantial fraction of the observed climate change". The natural
greenhouse effect is a well known phenomenon. It is well established that human
activities have led to large increases in the atmospheric concentrations of the three most
important long lived greenhouse gases. State-of-the-art computational climate models
are only able to reproduce the historical climate record when forcings associated with
human activities are included. Models which ignore forcings associated with human
activities are not able to reproduce the historical climate record. Natural climate forcing
agents such as the sun and volcanoes play an important role in the climate system but do
not explain the observed increase in global temperature over the past century.

"What is the state of the science?" It has been known for a very long time that gases
such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane trap infrared radiation in the
atmosphere and warm the Earth. In 1827 Fourier compared this effect to that of the
glass in a greenhouse from which the term "greenhouse effect" is derived. In 1896
Arrhenius calculated that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would cause a 5-6
o
C increase in global temperature. In 2001, state-of-the-art climate models run on the
latest super computers predict that a doubling of carbon dioxide would lead to a 1.5 –
4.5 oC warming. While it is remarkable how little change there has been over the past
105 years in the prediction of the global warming caused by a doubling of carbon
dioxide, this fact should not be taken as an indication that the prediction of future
climate is a mature scientific discipline. Global climate models are in an early stage of
development. There is no doubt that in the coming decades the sophistication and level
of detail in the models, and hence their predictive capability, will increase dramatically.
Current areas of significant uncertainty in the models are: (i) future levels of emission of
greenhouse gases (ii) future levels of atmospheric aerosols (iii) magnitude of feedback
mechanisms which amplify (or damp) the climate response to increased greenhouse gas
levels (iv) treatment of clouds and (v) the possible existence and importance of
metastable climate states. It seems likely that significant surprises lie in store in the
future scientific exploration of this fascinating field.
"What will future global climate be like?" As with all questions involving a prediction
of future events, this is a difficult question to answer. The best answer to this question is
"While the details are unclear, it appears likely that the future global climate will be
significantly warmer than that at present (during the next century the global climate will
most probably warm by an amount which is approximately 10 times that of the long
term natural variability of the climate system indicated by the black line in Figure 1)".
There are two fundamental problems associated with prediction of future global climate.
The first and most serious problem is that the future emission rates of greenhouse gases
are unknown. Will the world continue to rely heavily on fossil fuel for the next century,
or will non-fossil fuel energy sources such as nuclear and renewable options gain in
importance? It is clear that when looking 10 or 20 years into the future that fossil fuel
will continue as the dominant energy source. However, it is very difficult to predict the
dominant energy source 50 to 100 years into the future. Global population growth and
the development path chosen by the developing nations are important factors affecting
future greenhouse gas emissions. The second problem is that even if the future emission
rate of greenhouse gases was known exactly, the uncertainties inherent in the scientific

understanding of the link between greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change
(see previous paragraph) would still introduce substantial uncertainty in the predictions
of future climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considered many
different possible emission scenarios for greenhouse gases with a range of different
assumptions concerning economic growth, population growth, and reliance on fossil
fuels. The projected annual carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2100 from these
scenarios varied widely from a high of 30 GtC to a low of 4 GtC. The projected increase
in average global temperature for the scenarios is between 1.4 and 5.8 oC with a
warming of 2.5 – 3.2 oC being most probable. To place this prediction into context it is
useful to refer to Figure 1 and to extrapolate an additional 2.5 – 3.2 oC rise from 2000 to
2100. It is clear that by comparison to the natural variability observed over the past
1000 years, the climate change expected over the next 100 years will be substantial.

"What should we do?" This is of course a value question and as such it is not possible to
provide a purely scientific answer. However, science can provide some guidance in
addressing this question. Over the past century the demand for energy has increased
significantly. This demand has been satisfied primarily by fossil fuel. There was a
substantial (12 fold) and sustained (during each and every decade) increase in fossil fuel
usage over the past century and it is projected that fossil fuel use will continue to
increase for at least the next couple of decades. Carbon dioxide has a long atmospheric
lifetime and there is a delay of approximately 100 years between changes in carbon
dioxide emissions and equilibration of its atmospheric concentration. In the absence of
policies to address the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere it appears
very likely that over the next century the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide
will reach a level which is substantially (a factor of 2-3) greater than that of the preindustrial era. It would seem prudent at this point in time to pursue the research and
development of alternative global energy strategies which either decrease our long term
reliance on fossil fuels, or reduce carbon dioxide emission associated with fossil fuel
use (e.g. geologic sequestering of carbon dioxide). It would also seem prudent to devote
additional resources to improve the scientific understanding of the climate system and
hence reduce the uncertainties associated with projections of future climate change.
Climate change is a long term global issue which requires a long term global solution.

Earth's surface into space. In the early 1800s this effect was
compared to that of the glass panes which keep greenhouses
warmer than their surroundings – hence "greenhouse effect".
