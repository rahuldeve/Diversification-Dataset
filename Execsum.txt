This report is my independent contribution to the current climate change debate. The purpose is to provide
linkages between climatic processes and hydrometeorological responses. This is required for the
reconciliation of climate change theory with observational deductions derived from extensive studies of a
comprehensive South African database.
I have neither requested nor received any financial or material support from any source in connection with
these studies.

CLIMATE CHANGE: THERE IS NO NEED FOR
CONCERN
Results of global warming from whatever cause:


Clearly discernible increase in rainfall over South Africa



Increase in the numbers of beneficial, widespread, heavy rainfall events



Increase in evaporation. This has both beneficial and adverse effects



Increase in river flow, e.g. Zambezi River at Victoria Falls

 Increase in groundwater levels, e.g. in dolomite compartment near Zeerust
These are altogether different processes at sites located hundreds of kilometres apart, and
in different climatic regions. They are also mutually consistent with changes (where
detectable) that are concurrent in time. The beneficial increases are in accordance with
the global physical processes and international studies.

Continued global warming will NOT


Pose a threat to water supplies



Adversely affect agricultural production



Increase the risk of floods and droughts



Increase the spread of malaria



Increase the eutrophication of water in dams



Increase soil erosion



Result in the loss of natural plant and animal species

 Result in desertification
There is no believable evidence to support these claims.

It would be most unwise
For South African authorities
To force the implementation of costly measures
Based on unverifiable global climate models
And abstract theory
For which there is no believable evidence.

Please note
Please keep two major issues firmly in mind while reading this report. The first is the
complexity of the climatic processes, particularly their non-uniformity and abruptness of
changes in space and time. While changes in the mean conditions are important, it is the
long-term variability about the mean that is the dominant concern in evaluation and
adaptation studies. The second is the impossibility of describing these processes and their
interrelationships in any mathematical process model, however complex, bearing in mind
that these models have to be continuous in space and time. If engineering hydrologists
have been unable to develop universal, mathematical process models for simple rainfallrunoff processes after more than 50 years of concentrated, international efforts, what
reliability can be placed on global climate models that are purported to be able to predict
long term changes in the infinitely more complex climatic systems?

South Africa, with its wide range of climatic conditions from high rainfall conditions in
the east, to desert conditions in the west, and from winter rainfall regions in the south, via
year-round rainfall through to summer rainfall over most of the country, is ideal for
evaluating the consequences of global warming. Note also that it is the redistribution of
solar energy that drives the climatic processes – not temperature. South Africa lies within
the path of maximum poleward redistribution of solar energy and is therefore in an ideal
location for evaluating the consequences of variations in solar activity.
South Africa provides the ideal testing ground for international climate change theory.

1. General introduction to this report
Without water, no human, animal or plant life would be possible on this planet. The
dominant concern relating to global warming is therefore the possible adverse effects on
rainfall. These in turn may result in reduction in water supplies and agricultural
production. Environmental consequences are also of interest but do not have the same
priority.
There are a number of secondary concerns, including possible increases in the frequency
and magnitudes of floods and droughts, and direct consequences of increases in air
temperature. Other possible consequences will be addressed later in this report.
1.1. Analytical philosophy
The analytical philosophy used in this report differs fundamentally from that used in most
climate change studies. The basic assumption is that global warming from whatever
cause, increased progressively but not constantly, during the past century. If the
consequences of global warming are as severe as is generally claimed, then the
consequences should already be observable in hydrometeorological processes: rainfall,
river flow, lake levels, ground water levels, flood peaks and evaporation losses.
Conversely, if changes are not observable, this casts doubts on the postulated adverse
consequences of global warming on the whole range of terrestrial concerns. However,
change detection requires a refined numerical knowledge of the hydrometeorological
processes themselves. This in turn requires a thorough practical knowledge of
observation theory and advanced time series analyses. Only when these natural
characteristics have been quantified, will it be possible to detect abnormal changes that
can be attributed to unnatural global-warming, specifically due to anthropogenic actions.
This should not be too difficult if these consequences are as serious as is generally
claimed by climate change scientists. In the event, it took three years of diligent effort
applied to very large and comprehensive hydrometeorological database to achieve the
required high-resolution numerical characterisation of the processes, and the isolation of
the probable effects of global warming. These analyses are described in Part 1 of this
report.
Part 2 is a critical assessment of claims made by others in the light of the above
knowledge plus other factors. Part 3 describes the analytical methods used in this report
as well as the development of numerical methods for future adaptation procedures.
All the analyses and comments in this report refer to South African conditions, although I
believe that they are generally applicable elsewhere in the world.
The full report is in the final stages of preparation but it will take several months before it
is publicly available. Aspects can be made available should the need arise. The main
reason for withholding the final report is the international disarray surrounding the whole
climate change issue.

8

1.2. Science, economics and politics
The situation as I write this summary report is best described in a recent comment: ‘It is
an understatement to say that the climate change issue is undergoing change much faster
than the world's climate’. In a nutshell, until very recently, the whole issue was driven
principally by academic climatologists. The implementation of their recommendations
would require a very large public expenditure and have a restraining effect on the growth
of national economies. However, by training, they were unable to quantify either the
consequences in numerical terms or the costs and benefits in economic terms.
Politics is all about pleasing the electorate. The electorate requires a lot more than
alarmist rhetoric to persuade them to make financial sacrifices. This has resulted in a
complete about turn in international politics. The UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, once a
strong supporter of the Kyoto Protocol, put it succinctly when he recently commented:
‘The truth is that no country is going to cut its growth or consumption in the light of a
long-term environmental problem’.
Returning to climate change science, no matter how convinced the scientists may be
regarding their position, they have been unable to quantify their concerns to the degree
required by engineers, economists and political decision-makers, both to estimate costs as
well as to start implementing counter-measures and adaptation procedures. The reason for
this inability is their unavoidable reliance on abstract, unquantifiable process theory,
instead of pragmatic, readily quantifiable observation theory, based on the wealth of
available real-world data.
I have adopted a completely different approach in this report. I undertook a thorough
study of a very large and comprehensive database in search for characteristics that could
be related to anthropogenic causes. I had no motivation in either direction. If the evidence
of adverse consequences of anthropogenic action was present and unequivocal, then,
because of my long, direct experience and interest I had a moral, ethical and professional
duty to examine it and report it.
Conversely, if I was unable to detect meaningful changes, then I had an equally strong
duty to report my conclusions and so prevent unnecessary and costly counter-measures.
The fundamental criterion in my studies was the probable effect of global warming from
whatever cause, on the people and prosperity of this country.
This is my report.

PART 1: MY ANALYSES
2. Summary
A comprehensive database consisting of 11 804 years of South African annual
hydrometeorological data from 183 sites was assembled and analysed. The principal
conclusion was that there has been a beneficial increase in the mean annual rainfall
over South Africa by at least 9% during the 78-year period of record. There was
some indication of an acceleration of the increase during the past two decades. It
was established that there was a corresponding increase in open water surface
evaporation during this period. There was also a statistically significant 18 to 22year periodicity in many South African rainfall and river flow records. This is
characterised by sudden reversals from periods of below average conditions to
conditions of high rainfall and floods. It is demonstrated that this is related to solar
activity. The analyses produced no evidence to support the views that climate change
will result in a meaningful reduction in rainfall, or an increase in the frequency or
severity of floods and droughts within the foreseeable future. All evidence was to the
contrary.
It is concluded that there are no believable grounds for many claims relating to the
postulated adverse effects of global warming.
The problem that now confronts climate change scientists is that the advanced data
analyses described below do not support their theories or future scenarios. They will
have to address this discrepancy if their predictions are to have any credibility.
3. Introduction
The water resources of South Africa are approaching the limits of exploitation. The
purpose of these analyses is to characterise the multi-year properties of South African
hydrometeorological records in such a way that they can be used to detect current climate
change, as well as to model the effect of any future changes, should they occur. It will
facilitate the application of advanced water resource development analyses.
More money and more effort involving more scientists have been spent on climate
change research in recent years than any other research activity, (Pauli 1994, Gleick
2000). The predicted consequences are dire, yet it is still not possible to quantify the
anticipated changes to the degree required for the design and operation of measures to
counter the predicted effects. Nor does it appear that this information will become
available in the foreseeable future. There is therefore an urgent need to develop a
sophisticated numerical characterisation of the principal hydrological variables and their
inter-dependence, (Kundzewicz 1986, Abu-Zeid and Biswas 1992).
With this in mind, extensive numerical and graphical analyses were carried out on
representative, long, reliable, South African hydrometeorological records. This is the
most comprehensive analysis of routinely recorded data yet undertaken in South Africa.

10

In all, data from records at 183 sites were analysed, with a total record length of 11 804
years. The emphasis was on graphical analyses and tables, as they are superior tools for
the identification and quantification of subtle signals that are undetectable in
mathematical analyses. It is an elementary observation that abnormalities are often
hydrologically meaningful long before they reach a level of statistical significance.
Examples are apparent in the analyses below.
4. Methodology
It was appreciated from the start that it would be difficult to separate abnormal climaterelated characteristics from the background of high natural variability of the
hydrometeorological processes in dry climates such as in South Africa. While the data
from each site were analysed separately, the search was for signals that were common to
most sites for a particular process, and that were also common to most processes. This
has to be borne in mind when studying the analyses below.
4.1. Database
A database of annual values was assembled, consisting of eight different data sets. These
were the South African Weather Service’s (SAWS) district rainfall data from October
1921 to September 1999, plus hydrological data provided by the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry (DWAF). The DWAF data sets consisted of annual open water
surface (Symons pan) evaporation and concurrent rainfall, annual flows into storage
dams, annual river flows, annual flood peak maxima, annual groundwater levels, and the
southern oscillation index.
Other than patching minor gaps in the records, the data were used directly in the analyses
and were not smoothed, filtered, or otherwise manipulated in any way before or during
the analyses. All sites were chosen on the basis of their geographical representativeness
and long, uninterrupted records. These records are now long enough to provide a basis for
the determination of the multi-decadal properties of the processes. Details of the database
used in the analyses are shown in Table 1.

4.2. Terms used
In this presentation the term periodicity refers to a phenomenon that occurs at regular
intervals, while cyclicity refers to continuous cyclical behaviour. Serial correlation refers
to the relationship that may exist between the value in one year and that in previous
years. The term statistically significant refers to a 95% level of statistical significance,
while discernible implies that it is visually evident on the graphs, but has not yet reached
a 95% level of statistical significance. The term meaningful implies that it has a
measurable effect that should be accommodated in hydrological analyses. Hydrology
refers to mainstream hydrology, variously described as operational hydrology, applied
hydrology and engineering hydrology. Stochastic hydrology is a specialized field
involving the development and application of time series analyses. The marginal
distribution is the probability density function that describes the properties of the data.
4.3. Graphical analyses
The properties of historical data must be determined before they can be described
mathematically. Graphical analyses can provide insights that are not detectable by
mathematical analysis. Failure to appreciate this, has led to the inability to detect the
unambiguous increase in rainfall over South Africa during the period of record.
The procedure used was very simple and did not involve any manipulation of the data.
Nor did it involve any mathematical theory, other than standard serial correlation
analyses. Three types of graphical plots were used in the analyses. These were
histograms, accumulated departures from the record means, and conventional
correlograms.
The histograms were useful in providing the first indication of the extent of variability
about the record mean, including its magnitude and asymmetry. Trends were also
detectable in some records. Trends, if present, were more readily observable in the
accumulated departure plots. Of particular importance in the accumulated departure plots
was the identification of sudden reversals from periods of prolonged below average
conditions to periods of well above average conditions. Correlograms were very useful
tools for detecting anomalous behaviour of the mean itself. They were also useful when
searching for linkages between atmospheric mechanisms and hydrometeorological
responses. If any cyclical or oscillatory behaviour existed in the data, this would be
evident in the form of cyclicity in the correlograms. Graphical analyses were performed
for a total of 163 sites. Details will be provided in the full report.
5. Water and energy cycles
5.1. Energy, not temperature
The water cycle in Fig. 2 is well known. However, it is seldom appreciated that this is not
a continuous process in the drier regions of the world. In South Africa, only about 8% of
the rainfall is returned to the oceans via the river systems. The rest is evaporated back

12

into the atmosphere from vegetation, the soil and open water surfaces. All processes
increase in variability with increase in aridity.

Figure 2. The water and energy cycles

Conventionally, the hydrological cycle begins with the evaporation of water from the
oceans and the transport of this moisture through the atmosphere to the adjacent land
where precipitation occurs. Some of the water falling on the land surface infiltrates into
the ground while the rest constitutes surface runoff, which is routed through the natural
drainage systems. Subsequently, a portion of the water, which infiltrated into the soil is
removed by direct evaporation from the soil surface or by transpiration from vegetation.
The rest moves on through the groundwater system to reappear on the surface as springs
or directly into river channels. Eventually, all the water precipitated on the land is either
returned to the oceans or to the atmosphere, thus completing the cycle.
This gross over-simplification of the hydrological cycle draws attention away from the
all-important processes that govern the rate of transfer of water from one component of
the cycle to the next. The time and space distributions of rainfall result from the

13

interaction between meteorological systems, the topography of the land, and surface
heating of the land by solar radiation.
The statistical properties of river flow are directly related to the depth, area, duration,
time and space distribution of the rainfall, as well as antecedent conditions and frequency
of occurrence. The relationship between reservoir capacity, reservoir yield, and the
assurance of this yield depend on the statistical properties of the river flow at the site, and
gross evaporation losses from the surface area of the stored water, less rain falling
directly on this area.
The concept of the hydrological cycle also masks scale effects in time and space.
Turbulence is present in practically every case where the movement of air or water takes
place, from molecular scale through to giant gyres in the ocean. This in turn introduces
instability and consequently unpredictability in time. Heterogeneity in space has
frustrated the attempts of researchers to transfer rainfall-runoff model parameters from
the laboratory to the field, or from experimental catchments to the real world. This
unpredictability of major components of hydrological processes in both time and space
has been the rock on which much research based on the deterministic or 'cause-effect'
approach in hydrology has foundered. In these situations responses have to be described
in probabilistic terms rather than as a single, most likely result. Global climate modellers
should be aware of this.

14

Figure 3. Redistribution of solar energy

The corresponding energy cycle is less well known. Water flows downhill under the
influence of gravity. This is because the potential energy of a unit volume of water at the
top of a hill is greater than that at the bottom of the hill. Where there is an energy
gradient, water will move down the gradient. On the way there will be friction between
the water and the riverbed and banks. This friction will convert potential energy into heat
energy. This will warm the immediate environment and will eventually be radiated back
into space.
The role of the redistribution of solar energy on global climate does not appear to feature
in the IPCC studies, yet, as will be shown later in this report, this provides a valuable clue
relating to the uncertainties in climate change theory.
This also happens on a global scale as shown in Fig. 3. The solar energy per square
kilometre received in the tropics is much larger than that in the polar regions. This creates
an energy gradient. Where a gradient exists, energy must move down the gradient. This
energy is conveyed and distributed via the atmosphere and the oceans.
5.2. Temperature
While temperature does not feature in hydrological analyses, it is claimed that increase in
global temperature will have a major, adverse effect on the principal hydrological

15

variables. The emphasis in the literature on climate change has been on increases in
temperature associated with global warming. However, temperature is a measure not a
process. This distinction seems to be poorly understood. Referring to the hydrological
cycle in Fig. 2 above, the temperature of a particle of water as it proceeds though the
water cycle b-c-d-e-f will change along the route. The principal variable used by climate
change scientists should be energy, not temperature.
There is a great deal of confusion in the global warming literature regarding the
interpretation of the predicted increase in global temperature and its consequences. The
projected increase is about 30C during the next 100 years. The expected maximum and
minimum temperatures are broadcast daily on television. Typically, the differences
between the minimum and maximum temperatures at one location will be well in excess
of 30C. Also, the Pretoria temperatures are about 30C higher that those of Johannesburg.
So global warming during the next 100 years will result in the Johannesburg temperatures
being the same as those currently experienced in Pretoria. Few citizens in these two cities
will notice the difference. To postulate that these temperature increases will have
disastrous consequences on South Africa’s natural environment, has little credibility.
5.3. Principal variables
The principal variables used in hydrological analyses are rainfall, river flow and
evaporation. Their relative values vary greatly from region to region in South Africa. This
is demonstrated later in this report. The claims that global warming will result in the
reduction of the yield of water from dams and the consequent increases in water
restrictions are of no value, until the concurrent effect on the three principal variables and
the regional differences has been demonstrated. No such attempt appears to have been
made in the scientific studies reported in the IPCC literature.
6. Open water surface evaporation
The first process of interest within the hydrological cycle is that of open water surface
evaporation. This information is essential for the determination of the yield-capacity
relationships of storage dams. It is a candidate for the early detection of the effects of
global warming, because open water surface evaporation is a direct function of incoming
solar radiation, (as modified by cloud cover), air temperature and wind, all at the water
surface.
Concurrent daily observations of rainfall and open water surface evaporation commenced
as early as 1925. A summary of the results is presented in Table 2. The random
components were close to zero.

The Symons pan gross evaporation losses and concurrent rainfall gains are measured
daily. Their difference is the net evaporation loss that has to be accommodated in water
resource analyses. Evaporation losses exceed rainfall over almost the whole of South
Africa. In this set of examples, gross evaporation losses varied from 1275 mm at
Umbogintweni south of Durban, to 2781 mm at Kakamas near Upington. The concurrent
annual rainfalls in the data set varied from 1024 mm at Umbogintwini, to a mere 43 mm
at Vioolsdrif on the Orange River in the barren Richtersveld.
Fourteen of the 19 accepted stations showed a clearly discernible increase in the mean
values with time. A statistically significant, short duration serial dependence within the
range from one to 13 years was present at all sites. This serial dependence is due to
storage or inertia within the atmospheric system and is not due to cyclical phenomena.
No cyclicity was present in any of the records.

Any change in the hydrological processes resulting from climate change should become
apparent in the evaporation losses well before they become apparent in rainfall and river
flow. This is firstly because of the direct connection between evaporation and the climatic
driving mechanisms, and secondly because of the low variance in the historical data
which would make changes readily apparent. The analyses indicate that there has been a
clearly discernible increase in the evaporation losses over most of South Africa during the
period of record. Fig. 4 is an example. The increase with time is visible in the histogram
panel and the cusp-shaped plot in the accumulated departure panel. The serial dependence
is evident in the correlogram panel.
7. Rainfall
7.1. District rainfall
While point rainfall measurements are an accurate representation of rainfall at the point
of measurement, they become increasingly unrepresentative of rainfall at a distance from
that point. The interest is in changes in rainfall over an area, ultimately over the whole of
South Africa. Somewhere during the analyses there has to be an integration of the rainfall
properties. The alternatives are to analyse the data from each station separately and then
amalgamate the properties, or to amalgamate the data from all the stations in the area and
then perform a single analysis on the amalgamated data. The deciding factor is the large

18

station-to-station variability due to topography, aspect and other factors. These anomalies
will tend to be smoothed out when rainfall data from all stations in the area are averaged
before the analyses. Problems associated with the different regions can be overcome by
dividing South Africa into sensibly homogeneous climatic regions, and then averaging
the data from all stations within each region. This philosophy was followed in the
analyses in this report.
The South African rainfall database operated by the South African Weather Service
(SAWS) extends back to the middle of the 19th century. A monthly district rainfall
database was established in 1972 (Weather Bureau 1972) based on records from 1921
onwards, and is kept up to date. South Africa was divided into 93 sensibly homogeneous
rainfall districts, and the average rainfalls within each district for each month of record
were determined. This is the only areal hydrometeorological database that covers all of
South Africa, and is therefore ideal for the determination of rainfall over the country as a
whole. This is a particularly useful as it overcomes problems that arise when single
station, geographically unrepresentative data are used for the analyses.
The hydrological year totals were used in the present analyses. Summaries of the analyses
are provided in Tables 3 and 4. The most important conclusion was that there has been a
steady, beneficial increase in the mean annual rainfall over South Africa during the 78year period of record. This is reported for the first time in this report.
There are well-known and unavoidable shortcomings in this database. It could be argued
that the district rainfall data are spatially and temporally non-homogeneous to the extent
that the conclusions based on an analysis of the data are unreliable. The possible support
for such a claim is that some of the rainfall stations within some of the districts were
closed during the period of record while new stations were opened. Some of the new
stations were not in the same locations as the closed stations. Other records had long gaps
in them.
The issue is whether or not these deficiencies could account for the observed steady
increase in rainfall over South Africa during the 78-year period of record. The analyses
showed a consistency that would not have been present if these deficiencies had a
meaningful influence on the results. This is confirmed in Table 3 in which comparisons
are made between the average of the first half of the record with the second half (39-year
periods); the first 30 years with the last 30 years; and the first third with the last third (26year periods).

19

Figure 5. District rainfall boundaries

The mean annual precipitation (MAP) for the 26-year interim period was 507 mm. The
MAP increased by 8 mm from the first to the second 26-year periods and by 42 mm from
the second to the third 26-year periods. These values are mutually consistent, and there is
no possibility at all, that these increases could be artefacts of deficiencies in the database.

The 30-year period differences were used in the following analyses. This is a
conservative assumption. The steady increase during the period of record was clearly
visible in the plots of the accumulated departures from the means. This finding is also
consistent with postulated climatic changes, with natural change taking place, and an
acceleration in the latter part of the record.

20

It is not at all clear why climatologists failed to detect this clearly evident increase in
rainfall. It does, however, have a vital negative influence on their conclusions that South
Africa will experience drier conditions in the future. All evidence is to the contrary.

Of particular importance in this table is the clearly evident increase in the mean annual
precipitation over virtually the whole of South Africa during the 78-year period of record.
Of the 81 districts with complete records, 75 districts showed an increase in the mean
annual precipitation. Forty-two districts had increases of 10% or more, 12 districts had
increases of more than 20%, and four districts had increases of more than 40%.
The rainfall in the subsequent two years was well above normal. The most important
conclusion is that there has been a steady, beneficial increase in the mean annual rainfall
over South Africa for at least the past 80 years. The conclusion by the authors quoted in
Tyson & Gatebe (2001), that rainfall over the summer rainfall region of southern Africa
has shown no large systematic linear trends since 1900, is strange, as there has been an
unmistakable and consistent increase in the MAP over virtually the whole of South Africa
since the commencement of district rainfall records in 1921. The conclusions reached by
climatologists that are dependent on this assumption and are therefore in error.
Another important property is the clearly discernible long-term periodicity in the data.
Eighteen of the districts have statistically significant periodicity within the range 18 to 21
years; 38 districts exhibit discernible periodicity within this range; and 37 districts have
no discernible periodicity within this range. As the degree of statistical significance is
dependent on both the length of the record and the magnitude and nature of the variability
about the mean, the periodicity may be present in more of the districts, but has not yet
reached the level of statistical significance.
7.2. Widespread rainfall
In our commissioned study Determination of the risk of widespread interruption of
communications due to floods (Alexander and van Heerden, 1991), my colleague who
occupied the Chair of Meteorology, developed a widespread rainfall classification
scheme. These algorithms originated from a similar scheme developed by van Heerden
(1988) to classify individual rain days.
The SAWS rainfall stations for the period 1910 to 1989 of which some 2500 were
available, were used. A requirement was set that the data for each individual station for
the specific month had to be reliable. Rainfall totals for four consecutive days were

22

calculated using daily rainfall figures. All suspect or unreliable data and accumulated
rainfall totals on the record led to the rejection of the station's data for that month. Only
stations reporting 100 mm or more during the month were used in the analysis.

Figure 6. Fifteen regions used for regional widespread rainfall analyses

A full list of all the classes of rainfall events for all the regions during the period 1910 to
1989 is available. Table 5 summarises the results of the long classification process.

In total, 960 months of rainfall data were analysed for each station. A total of 6255 events
could be classified. Of these 350 were Class 2 and greater while the 128 events greater
than Class 3 can be considered as serious events. Significant flooding occurred
somewhere over the country during some 13% of the months.
Four Class 5 events occurred. All were along the south-eastern and eastern coastal
regions (Regions 4 and 5). All were separate events. For the coastal zone stretching from
Port Elizabeth to the Mozambique border, the frequency of occurrence is approximately
once in twenty years.

Figure 7. Frequency of Class 3 to 5 rainfall events per year for the entire South Africa

This information is summarised in Fig. 7 where a gradual increase from 1925 to 1970 is
apparent, followed by an accelerated increase thereafter.
The next issue is whether or not the increase in rainfall will result in an increase in
damaging floods.
Fig. 7 above shows the numbers of events in the Class 3 to 5 categories during each
hydrological year for the 80-year period. There is an increase from about 1970 onwards.
A total of 6171 widespread rainfall events were identified which were classified in terms
of their flood-producing potential as shown in Table 6.

Floods of all magnitudes have the beneficial effect of filling dams, particularly after
severe droughts, thereby assuring water supplies. The associated heavy rains also raise
the soil-moisture content, sustain crops and natural vegetation, raise groundwater levels
and generate river flow. Without these widespread rainfall events South Africa would be a
desert. Assume (for the sake of argument) that global warming increased the frequency of
these events by 10%. This would have resulted in an additional 12 potentially damaging
events in the Class 3 to 5 categories, but an additional 600 beneficial high rainfall events.
7.3. Simple analytical procedures
Note that the values in Table 6 above were obtained by simple counting procedures.
There were no models, no mathematics and no measurement calibration errors. The
weather systems that caused these events as well as the resulting damage, if any, were
identified and tabulated. I would not dare use this data on its own to derive the properties
of the climate over South Africa, let alone the rest of the globe. So you can imagine the
cynicism of practitioners and researchers in the hard sciences in response to the IPCC
claims based on isolated proxy data, hockey stick prediction graphs, and mathematical
models that are inherently incapable of reproducing the rainfall characteristics described
in this report.
7.4. Consequences of global warming?
The mean annual precipitation over almost the whole of South Africa has progressively
increased by at least 9% during the 78-year period of record with a high degree of
assurance. This is similar in magnitude and direction to that quoted by Gleick (2000)
based on a study of a large number of refereed papers in the USA. He reported that the
average precipitation over the contiguous USA has increased by about 10% since 1910,
and that the United States has, on average, warmed by two-thirds of a degree Celsius
since 1900.
This conclusion is reinforced by the concurrent increase in open water surface
evaporation in South Africa, which is a direct function of incoming solar radiation and air
temperature. This leads to the conclusion that if the present global trends continue, then
the mean annual rainfall over South Africa will also continue to increase.
No large-scale studies of South African rainfall have demonstrated a general decrease in
rainfall. On the contrary, there is more than sufficient evidence of a sustained increase in
rainfall over most of South Africa during the period of continuous records. Claims that
global warming has in the past, or will in the future, result in a general reduction in
the rainfall over South Africa are without foundation.

25

8. River flow
Routine daily observations of river flow started in the early 1900s. Tables 7, 8 and 9 show
the properties of annual river flow relevant to this presentation. These are the annual
inflows into representative dams; annual flows at gauged sites; and annual flood peak
maxima at representative gauged sites respectively.
The dam inflow data used in Table 7, included all the information necessary for the
determination of the yield-capacity relationship, including that used to determine the
effect of periodicity on the assurance of the yield from the dam. These analyses are not
included in this report.
The river flow data in Table 8 are from representative flow gauging sites. This
information is used to determine the properties of annual river flows required for the
parameter estimation of the prediction model.
The annual flood peak maxima in Table 9 are part of a much larger data set consisting of
a total of 6 728 years of data from 152 sites that was used for the statistical analysis of
extreme floods, (Alexander 2002b). The purpose of this table was to examine the validity
of the observation that there is a systematic, periodic reversal from a sequence of years
with abnormally low flows (droughts) followed by one or more years of abnormally high
flows (floods) first reported by Hutchins (1889) more than 100 years ago.
Of particular interest, is the distinct pattern of reversals that occurred within a year or two
of the reversals that were recorded in 1912, 1933, 1954, 1973 and 1995. These values are
shown in the second-last columns of the three tables, expressed as the number of
coincident reversals in the graph for the particular record vs the number of ‘standard’
reversals during the same period. These patterns confirm the observations of Hutchins
(1889) and those reported by Alexander on a number of occasions during recent years.
(Alexander 1978b, 1990, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 1996, 1997, 2002a, 2002b). There is very
strong evidence of a periodic pattern of prolonged droughts, suddenly being broken by
one or more years of abnormally high runoff. An important conclusion, is that it is
essential that estimates of changes in the mean values take this periodicity into account.
Five of the 11 accepted stations in Table 7 show a decrease in the mean while only two
stations show an increase. Concurrent reversals are present at nine of the stations.

8.1. Annual river flow
The properties of annual river flow are shown in Table 8. Statistically significant, shortterm serial dependence is present in eight of the 14 flow records, and the characteristic
reversals are present in all but two of the flow records. A large part of the Hartbeespoort
Dam catchment includes urban areas, and it is tempting to ascribe the increased inflow
shown in Table 7 to this urbanisation, but there are some reservations, (Alexander 1990).

8.2. Zambezi River
The analyses of the flow record of the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls are interesting for
a number of reasons. The catchment of the river is in the high rainfall region of central
Africa and there are extensive swamps in the catchment. Together, these have a

27

moderating effect on the year-to-year variability. The river has a strong perennial flow,
and its characteristics are close to those of rivers in moderate climates that feature in
much of the hydrological literature.
The steady increase in flow from 1907 all the way through to the 1980s is very clear in
both the histogram and the accumulated departure plots in Fig. 8, with a decrease from
then onwards. The correlogram is also interesting because it shows statistically
significant serial dependence all the way through to 11 years, but there is no evidence of
21-year periodicity. Nor is there any evidence of cyclicity.

Figure 8. Annual flows in the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls, 1907- 1994.

The annual flow record in the Vaal River shows quite different characteristics from those
in the Zambezi River. The annual flows are far more variable and there is no evidence of
an increase with time. However, there is very clear, statistically significant 21-year
periodicity with sudden reversals occurring in the years commencing October 1933,
1954, 1973 and 1995. Again, there is no evidence of any cyclicity. Nor is there any
statistically significant serial correlation for other periods. This is the most studied river
flow record in South Africa.

28

The decreases in the annual river flows are the result of upstream abstractions as
the level of utilisation increases. There is no linkage with global warming.
9. Groundwater
The groundwater levels in the Wondergat sinkhole in a large dolomitic compartment in a
semiarid area of South Africa some 800 km to the south of the Zambezi River, and
discharges from other dolomitic compartments, display characteristics similar to those in
the Zambezi River. The interpretation of the characteristics of the Zambezi River and the
dolomitic compartments, is that they all have large storage components. The discharge
from Maloney’s eye has a remarkably smooth correlogram. The large storage capacity
completely suppresses the random year-to-year variation in the rainfall. There is no
evidence of adverse effects that could be ascribed to global warming.
10. Southern oscillation index
The Southern Oscillation Index data from 1881 to 1995 were also analysed. This 114year long record showed a distinct discontinuity in the mean value from 1974 onwards. It
also showed statistically significant serial correlations with frequencies of seven and 14
years, as well as 21 years with a lower level of confidence. This was despite a sudden
change in the mean value that occurred in 1974. Normally, data displaying this sudden
change in the mean would be suspect and the possibility of measurement errors would
have to be investigated, or the cause of the discontinuity sought. This was beyond the
scope of the analyses but is concurrent with other anomalies reported in the literature.
11. Flood peak maxima
The properties of the annual flood peak maxima are presented in Table 9. Of the 16
accepted records, 12 show a decrease in the mean annual values, and only one record
shows an increase. This is despite the general increase in rainfall. Upstream utilisation,
particularly water supply and farm dams play a role as the dams have to fill before
passing floodwaters downstream. As shown above, mean annual evaporation losses are
well in excess of the mean annual rainfall. The antecedent soil-moisture deficit caused by
prolonged antecedent evaporation has to be satisfied before flow takes place, particularly
before high rates of runoff can occur. Short-term serial dependence is present in eight of
the accepted records, and concurrent reversals are present in 14 of the 16 records.

There is no evidence of a general increase in the frequency of flood peak maxima
during the period of record. Nor can future increases be expected. This is discussed
again below.
12. Linkages with solar activity
12.1.Lord Kelvin’s error
Future historians will be interested in the causes of the difficulties currently experienced
in climate change science. They need look no further than Lord Kelvin's presidential
address to the Royal Society in 1892 when he pronounced that there was no linkage
between solar activity and famines in India. This was despite a wealth of evidence
showing a concurrence in time between sunspot activity and the famines.
Lord Kelvin made the mistake that many scientists continue to make. He was entitled to
maintain that variations in solar radiation were too small to account for the linkage
between sunspot numbers and famines. He was not entitled to conclude that no linkage
existed. This fundamental difference between process theory and observational theory
continues to bedevil climate change science. I expand on this below.

30

12.2.My studies
Fig. 9 is from my paper Linkages between solar activity and climatic responses
(Alexander 2005b). It shows an undeniable, concurrent linkage between the annual flows
in the Vaal River and solar activity. Pure mathematical-statistical analyses are inherently
incapable of describing this relationship.

Figure 9. Comparisons of the characteristics of annual sunspot densities with corresponding
characteristics of the annual flows in the Vaal River.

Starting with the sunspot graphs in Fig. 9, the top panel is the conventional dimensionless
histogram, where all values are expressed as multiples of the record mean values. The 21year periodicity is apparent. A reference datum value of –200 was used in order to
accommodate the negative values. This has no effect on the interpretations.
The most informative graphical presentation is in the second panel, which shows the
accumulated departures from the record mean value. These are obtained by subtracting
the mean values (1,0) from each of the values in the histogram. Some of the values will
be negative. These are accumulated one at a time and the sum plotted.
An increase in the accumulated departures of the sunspot numbers during the period of
record is immediately apparent. This is in accordance with observations of an increase in
solar activity during the past century as shown by the increases in sunspot density during
this period. This is a possible cause of a corresponding increase in global warming and
the hydrological characteristics discussed in this report. This possibility should not be
overlooked.

31

The maximum negative departures occur at the start of the 21-year periods, identified as
(A), (C), (E) and (G). The third panel is the correlogram. This is a standard calculation
procedure in time series analyses. The statistically significant cyclicity is clearly
apparent. The 95% confidence limits are ± 0.22. The minimum and maximum (H)
autocorrelation coefficients occur respectively at 10 (-0.83) and 21 (+0.70) years, which
are well in excess of the 95% confidence limits.
Now compare the annual flows in the Vaal River with the sunspot density characteristics.
The histogram shows the high degree of asymmetry about the mean value with many
more values less than the mean value than above it. This is typical of river flow data in
dry climates.
The accumulated departure plot and its comparison with that of the double sunspot cycle
are very instructive. The reversals at points (A), (C), (E) and (G) are virtually identical
with the corresponding reversals in the sunspot data. They occurred during the
hydrological years beginning October 1933, 1954, 1974, and 1995. The rising limbs A-B,
C-D and E-F are sequences of years where the inflows were greater than the mean value.
The falling limbs B-C, D-E, and F-G are sequences where the inflows were less than the
mean value. These alternating sequences are well known in the hydrological literature
where they are referred to as the Joseph effect, after Joseph’s biblical prophecy.
The statistically significant cyclicity in the sunspot cycles is no longer present in the
correlogram of the annual flows in the Vaal River, where the residual coefficients indicate
random noise. The only, but very important, residual serial correlation, is the statistically
significant 21-year periodicity. This is identified at (H) in the bottom panel of the figure.
Fig. 10 shows concurrent increases in solar activity; air temperature measured at Cape
Agulhas at the southern tip of Africa; and the number of beneficial, widespread rainfall
events.

32

Figure 10. Concurrent increases in solar radiation, temperature and frequency of beneficial,
widespread rainfall events.

These are solid confirmatory studies, except that I have demonstrated that the most
probable cause of the increase is an increase in solar activity. While human activities may
have influenced the situation to a small degree, it is not possible to separate these effects
from those caused by an increase in solar activity.
The reversals in the flows in the Vaal River from drought sequences to flood sequences
evident in Fig. 9 correspond closely with similar reversals in sunspot density. This is
evident in Table 10. In all but one sequence (Vaal River 1965/66), the three-year totals
after the minima of both river flow and sunspot numbers, are substantially greater than
the three-year totals before the minima. This information demonstrates the close
association between major variations in river flow and corresponding variations in
sunspot activity, with a high degree of confidence.

There are several interesting features in this table. There is a periodic, almost three-fold,
sudden increase in the annual flows in the Vaal River. This is directly associated with a
six-fold increase in sunspot numbers. The second important point is the consistency in the
range of sunspot numbers before and after the reversal. The totals for the three prior years
varied between 25 and 60, and the totals of the three immediately subsequent years varied
between 250 and 400. It is very clear that these are systematic changes associated with
the sunspot minima, and are not random events.
This relationship exists despite the long and complex energy path starting at the Sun and
ending in the river flow that enters Vaal Dam. The only residual energy is the potential
energy, which is a function of the elevation of the water mass above sea-level. This
residual energy has its origin in solar activity; followed by the arrival on the Earth’s
atmosphere, continents and oceans; followed by the poleward movement of the energy
through complex atmospheric and oceanic processes; followed by the weather systems
that produce the rainfall; and finally by the complex rainfall-runoff processes. The
survival of the periodic signals on its own demonstrates a strong and unequivocal
relationship between variation in solar activity and the corresponding variation in
climatic responses.
Further confirmation
Further confirmation of the linkage between the rate of increase in sunspot density and
rainfall over South Africa as a whole is shown in Table 11, which shows the relationship
between the months during which the maximum rainfall occurred and the corresponding
years in which the sunspot minima occurred. The lag is the difference in years when the
sunspot minima are used to predict the rainfall maxima. The lower panel is a repeat of the
upper panel, using the flood peak maxima observed in the Mkomazi River, south of

34

Durban. The 1856 peak was concurrent with the flood peak in the Mgeni River, where
floodwaters flowed across Durban and into Durban harbour. These floods occurred in
March 1856. The maximum recorded flood engraved on the buttress of the Georges V
Bridge built in 1760 across the Loire River in Orleans, France occurred in June 1856. The
sunspot minimum occurred in December 1855. (World Data Centre for the Sunspot Index
2005). This correspondence is far too great to be coincidental.

Six of the eight country-wide rainfall events and four of the five flood peak maxima in
the Mkomazi River occurred within two years of the sunspot minima. This confirms that
these extreme events are sensibly synchronous with the reversals in sunspot density
associated with the sunspot minima as shown in Table 11.
It is also important to note that these maxima were recorded 80 years ago (rainfall) and
149 years ago (Mkomazi floods). There is no evidence of an increase of these extreme
events that could be associated with global warming.

Alternating wet and dry sub-periods
Analyses showed that the rainfall and river flow during the first half-period (first sunspot
cycle) are appreciably higher than the second half-period. For example, for the first ten
years of the period, the average of the maximum annual river flow values for all sites
analysed was 675% of the record mean values compared with the average of the
following ten years of only 380% of the record mean values. This is probably associated

35

with the sign of the Sun’s magnetic polarity. Other analyses not reported here showed that
the high values in the first half-period are the result of widespread, heavy rainfall events,
while the low values in the second half-period are the consequence of the absence of
these events.
More than 100 years ago Hutchins (1889) reported the linkage between sunspot numbers
and famines in India that occurred in the early 1800s. He also demonstrated the
predictability of floods that broke prolonged droughts in South Africa first reported in
1822, as well as the shape of the descending values shown in Fig. 9, and the alternating
sequences of wet and dry periods. Unfortunately, climatologists have not followed this
route for the development of long-range climate prediction methods.
Tyson (1987) provided evidence supporting the presence of alternating sequences of
years with high and low rainfall over large regions of South Africa. He noted the
oscillatory nature of the data and although he was unable to trace its cause, he concluded
that its physical reality was considerable in South Africa and in other countries. He noted
that the 11-year solar cycle was mentioned in the literature but he did not discuss it
further.
Bredenkamp (2000) studied groundwater resources. He used the cumulative departure
method as his principal tool, for which he developed a mathematical relationship. He
demonstrated the presence of wet and dry sequences from 1919 through to 1992 based on
water level observations at Lake Mzingazi; discharge from the Uitenhage springs
corrected for abstractions; water levels at Lake St Lucia; and groundwater levels at the
Wondergat sinkhole in a large dolomitic formation. These all have high storage/input
ratios that smooth out the short-term fluctuations.
Table 12 is a combination of the independent observations by Tyson (1987) and
Bredenkamp (2000), each relating to different climatic processes and different analytical
methodologies, and a comparison with sunspot cycles. The first and most important
observation is the presence of alternating sequences of wet and dry years, and the
corresponding alternating sequences of sunspot cycles. While the comparative years are
not precise, there can be no doubt at all that a meaningful relationship exists with sunspot
cyclicity.

Compare the lengths of the sequences of wet and dry years with the biblical seven years
of plenty followed by seven years of famine. The ancient Egyptians were well aware of
these alternating sequences in the annual flows of the life-giving Nile River.
Mathematical modelling
The final stage was the development of a mathematical simulation model for water
resource development and management applications, which accommodates the periodic
characteristics described above. There was no need to invoke causal linkages with solar
activity in the model, as the analyses do not depend on them. The methodology is
described in Alexander, (1994, 1997). Details are provided in Part 3 of this report.
Interpretation
The following view was expressed in the IPCC’s Summary for Policymakers (IPCC
2001):
Since the late 1970s, satellite instruments have observed small oscillations due
to the 11-year solar cycle. Mechanisms for the amplification of solar effects on
climate have been proposed, but currently lack a rigorous theoretical or
observational basis.

37

In 1889 Hutchins published a very perceptive and well-documented linkage between
solar activity and climate-related responses. (Hutchins 1889). This linkage was
repudiated by many eminent solar physicists, who for the past hundred years have
maintained, and still maintain, that these correlations lack causal mechanisms supported
by high quality data.
In this report an unambiguous, concurrent linkage is demonstrated with a high
degree of confidence, based on a detailed study of a very large climate-related
database.
Hopefully, the information provided here will assist solar physicists identify the specific
characteristics of the solar processes that cause these climatic features that have been
noted and documented for more than a thousand years.
The occurrence of the reversal of the accumulated departure of the mean in 1995 that is
evident in many of the data sets, completed three full cycles from 1933 to 1995 and
raised the level of statistical significance in the analyses. An interesting question is why
the statistically significant and hydrologically meaningful properties of rainfall and river
flow have become so clearly apparent in these studies, but have not been reported
previously. The main reason is the reliance on mathematical analyses that obscure the
sudden reversals from droughts to floods, and are unable to accommodate instability,
serial correlation and asymmetrical periodicity. Another, and equally important reason, is
that the smoothing of the data prior to mathematical analyses reported by many authors,
obscures these very important characteristics.
These reversals are not present in the evaporation analyses but are progressively more
apparent in rainfall, river flow and flood peak maxima. This leads to the conclusion that
the periodic behaviour is the consequence of periodicity in the heavy rainfall-producing
events. This may be the reason why the periodicity has not yet been detected and
described in studies based on rainfall, river flow and floods in moderate climates. It also
demonstrates the danger of extrapolating experience based on moderate climate
hydrology where the periodic signals are not discernible, to the more arid, subtropical
regions. It is also possible that the hydrological processes in low rainfall regions amplify
the periodicity, which may not be apparent in climates with higher rainfall and less
variable rainfall and river flow.
Many of the anomalies in the hydrometeorological processes that have been attributed to
climate change are the consequence of regular, predictable, climate-related changes in the
processes identified in this report.
The presence of 21-year (approximate) periodicity in the climatic processes other
than evaporation is unequivocal and has to be accommodated in any detection or
adaptation studies. Given this knowledge, the assumption that global warming
arising from human activity will increase climate variability and consequently
increase the magnitude and frequency of floods and droughts, or pose threats to
water supplies, has little foundation.

13.1.Historical floods and droughts

Figure 11. Historical flood peaks in the Mkomazi River show no progressive changes with time.

Fig. 11 shows the flood peaks observed in the Mkomazi River in KwaZulu-Natal. There
is no progressive increase with time. An examination of many historical records showed
that the floods during the latter half of the 1800s remain the highest on record. There are
no indications of systematic increases that could be associated with climate change.

Fig. 12 shows the extent of historical water supply droughts at three representative major
dams. While there is an indication of an increase at Vaal Dam, and possibly also at Gariep
Dam, there were no progressive changes at Midmar Dam.

13.2.Risk and society
The following are extracts from my study commissioned by the United Nations IDNDR
secretariat and financed by the South African Department of Foreign Affairs titled Risk
and society – an African perspective (Alexander 1999). The study report is appended to
the full version of my report summarised here.
The production of food and the provision of water are the foundations on which society is
built. These in turn are dependent on the productive capacity of the soils and the annual
rainfall. In moderate climates the rainfall is generally dependable, and for most of the
time it exceeds the needs of the soil on which it falls. The surplus flows into the
perennially flowing rivers. The risks of below average rainfall can be quantified and
accommodated in financially secure societies where alternative sources of food can be
imported into the areas where shortfalls are experienced.
The situation is very different in the semi-arid regions of the world where soils are less
productive and the rainfall is much more variable. River channels are dry for most of the

40

year and water supplies cannot be assured without the construction of water storage
works. The risks of crop failures and stock losses due to prolonged rainfall shortages
(droughts) are consequently much greater.
The high level of population growth in poor communities worsens the position. This in
turn has led to over-utilization of the natural environment, which has become severely
degraded, and its productive capacity is severely diminished. Neither the agricultural
communities themselves nor their governments have the financial resources to import
food in times of severe shortages and they have to rely on emergency relief from other
countries to avert widespread famine.
Because the climate in these semiarid regions is more variable, abnormally high rainfall
is also more frequent and gives rise to severe floods with consequent high loss of life and
loss of possessions and livelihoods.
These two forms of natural disasters – floods and droughts – are not only more severe in
semiarid regions due to their more variable climates, but they also cause significantly
more damage to the social and economic infrastructures that are affected by them. The
rural populations are malnourished and more prone to disabling and life-threatening
diseases, which are on the increase in many African countries.
The situation in most countries on the African continent continues to deteriorate at an
alarming rate, and the objectives of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution
establishing the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) are not
being met. Disasters are not increasing because of the increase in the frequency of
the hazards, but because of the increasing vulnerability to the hazards. The ability of
many countries to finance vulnerability reduction measures is hampered by financial
austerity programmes associated with economic reform and the heavy tax burdens
required to service the national debt.
This presentation reflects the African perspective on natural disaster reduction. It is based
on information gathered from many sources, including IDNDR publications, publications
of United Nations agencies, African country reports, presentations at conferences,
discussions with professional colleagues, and personal observations and experiences in
Southern African countries stretching over a period of more than forty years.
The conclusion reached is that if the principles of natural disaster reduction – particularly
vulnerability reduction methods – are not included in national policies, the slide from
democracy to civil unrest and eventually to anarchy will affect an increasing number of
countries on the African continent.
This is a complex problem with no easy solutions.
13.3.Pattern of impoverishment of the rural poor
The increase in vulnerability to disasters in many developing countries of Africa arises
from the following repetitive sequence.
1. Growing population.

41

2. Increasing utilisation of natural resources.
3. Land clearing.
4. Felling of trees for firewood.
5. Overgrazing of fragile ecosystems especially in semi-arid areas.
6. Soil erosion.
7. Desertification.
8. Collapse of natural ecosystems.
9. Hunger and malnutrition.
10. Partial recovery after the drought has passed, and the cycle is repeated
The downward trend of impoverishment will continue unless this cycle is broken. If
conditions continue to deteriorate, the rural population will be attracted to urban areas on
the assumption that their living conditions will improve.
11. Migration to the cities by rural poor and refugees.
12. Unplanned occupation of high-risk peri-urban areas.
13. Few job opportunities, and rising crime rate as a means of survival.
14. Breakdown of civil administration.
15. Political instability.
16. Civil war.
17. Cross-border conflict.
18. Anarchy.
These symptoms are present in many African countries.
13.4.Natural disaster mitigation in rural areas
In general, the objectives of any State are to provide a long-term shelter within which its
citizens can prosper. Where this shelter is endangered, the State is obliged to take action
to preserve it. The objectives of the individuals within the State are firstly to survive and
secondly to prosper within the national shelter. The objectives of the State as well as its
citizens are accommodated in most developed countries, but not in many developing
countries where the long-term objectives of the State conflict with the short-term
objectives of large sectors of the population.
It is clearly impossible for the State to accept responsibility for every disaster that may
befall its individual citizens. It is equally clear that the State has responsibilities for
implementing disaster mitigation measures for larger, highly vulnerable communities.
The difficult issue of drawing the line between helping the people to help themselves and
making the people dependent on the State for the rest of their lives is well documented.
The objective of State assistance should be such that it increases the resilience of
vulnerable communities without encouraging long-term dependence on the State. This is
the objective of the adaptation studies.

42

13.5.Managing drought risks
There are at least two strategies for managing drought risks in Africa. The first is to
maximise the gains, while the second is to minimize the losses.
The first is the preferred option for less vulnerable areas with higher production
potentials. The strategy is to maximise the value of production in normal and good
rainfall years, while minimising the setbacks in bad years. The idea is that gains from a
higher value strategy will outweigh the losses, which themselves will be reduced by onand off-farm development. It is an outward-oriented drought management strategy and it
is essential if small farmers are to escape from the rural poverty trap.
The second strategy is more defensive and conservative. It is the preferred option for the
very marginal and vulnerable areas. It involves an emphasis on survival mechanisms such
as the use of drought tolerant crops for domestic and local consumption. The emphasis is
on survival in a hostile environment rather than for income generation. This should not be
seen as a permanent solution.
Risks must be managed in such a way by the State and the subsistence farmers that a
route is opened that leads not only away from vulnerability to drought, but away from
poverty as well. This requires an advanced knowledge of drought analyses not the
simplistic claims of climate change scientists.
13.6.Flood risk reduction in unplanned urban settlements
The migration of the rural poor to the cities and resultant development of informal
settlements in flood prone areas have caused an exponential increase in the risk of loss of
life and possessions during floods. In South Africa alone there are tens of thousands of
people living in unplanned, flood prone settlements in urban areas. Most local authorities
around the world prohibit residential occupation below a designated floodline, yet in
many urban areas in developing countries there are thousands of people living along the
banks of rivers below this floodline. Shacks are often built on all available space right up
to the edge of the almost vertical riverbanks. In some cases shacks are built on refuse
dumps within the channel itself. Even minor floods that do not overtop the riverbanks
could engulf the shacks within the river channel, and undermine the riverbanks causing
the shacks on the banks to collapse into the river.
Once the flood water level rises above the riverbanks the flimsy, densely packed shacks
further from the river will start collapsing. The debris from the shacks, particularly
floating timber and submerged corrugated iron sheets caught in the fast flowing water
will seriously injure escapees attempting to wade through the water even if this is less
than knee-deep.
This debris will also hinder rescue attempts and increase the probability that people
washed into the river will drown. Debris may also block bridge openings and deflect the
flood to another area that would otherwise have been out of danger. Lives may be lost
when spectators gather on bridges or on the river banks and their escape routes are cut off

43

as the river rises, or the riverbanks collapse. It will be impossible to use rubber boats on
the river to rescue people trapped in the debris. A major flood will rise rapidly, destroy all
shacks in its path and result in a large loss of life.
The development and dissemination of awareness programmes is an essential prerequisite
for successful flood risk reduction measures in this situation. This is particularly
important for newly established communities who have not been exposed to flood risks.
Impediments to efficient awareness programmes in Africa include low literacy levels.
(Only 60% of the population of Burundi are literate, and low literacy levels exist in many
other African countries.) Other impediments to communications with those at risk are the
variety of vernacular languages, dialects and customs.
Complete success of flood risk reduction measures in informal settlements within urban
areas is unlikely to be achieved because of the very high exposure to flood risks, as well
as limitations of manpower and other resources available to deal with the resulting
emergencies. An unpalatable fact is that after a flood the failures such as loss of life
can easily be measured, but successes can not.
13.7.Risk summary
In many developing countries in Africa the rural areas are no longer able to support the
rising populations that depend on them. The ability of these countries to finance disaster
mitigation activities is hampered by financial austerity programmes associated with
economic reform and the heavy tax burdens required to service the national debt.
Drought mitigation strategy. Disaster mitigation plans in the rural areas of Africa
should move away from environmental concerns to human livelihood concerns. Because
of the frequent occurrence of drought and its spatial extent, the costliest option is to
ignore drought and simply react to each incident. Countries should include natural
disaster reduction as part of their development plans, otherwise progress in social and
economic development will continue to be eroded by recurring disasters. Disaster
prevention, mitigation and preparedness are better than disaster response in achieving the
goals and objectives of the Decade. These measures must be considered in conjunction
with the social, economic and political limitations of the communities at risk.
Flood risk reduction in unplanned urban settlements. The best solution is to provide
incentives that will encourage the threatened communities to move to less vulnerable
areas. In many cases this will be a long process as job opportunities and housing will
have to be provided at a faster rate than the influx of socially and economically
disadvantaged people into the high-risk areas. This leaves the implementation of flood
awareness programmes and flood warning systems as the only viable short-term solution.
Technology transfer. In many developing countries the limited financial resources and
technological expertise prevent the development of disaster mitigation measures. The
importation of expertise developed elsewhere is inhibited by language differences and
lack of expert knowledge of local socio-economic conditions of the recipients and their

44

ability to understand and implement the proposals. The best solution method of
technology transfer is by planning and operating demonstration projects.
Research. There are many scientists undertaking research on climate change and on
ecological and environmental problems, but not many researchers are undertaking
research on disaster risk reduction. This imbalance will have to be rectified if the slide
into further impoverishment has to be turned.
14. Conclusions to Part 1
There is a large station-to-station variability in the hydrometeorological records, and care
has to be exercised when interpreting individual analyses. Nevertheless, there are strong
and unambiguous signals that are common to most graphical and statistical analyses
within each data set. The following are some important observations and interpretations
generated by this study.
1. The mean annual precipitation over almost the whole of South Africa has
progressively increased by at least 9% during the 78-year period of record with a
high degree of assurance. There is some indication of an acceleration in the rate of
increase in the last two decades. This is similar in magnitude and direction to that
observed by Gleick (2000), who reported that the average precipitation over the
contiguous USA has increased by about 10% since 1910, and that the United
States has, on average, warmed by two-thirds of a degree Celsius since 1900. This
conclusion is reinforced by the concurrent increase in open water surface
evaporation in South Africa, which is a direct function of incoming solar radiation
and air temperature. This leads to the conclusion that any additional global
warming will further increase the annual rainfall over South Africa, and that
the possibility that the annual rainfall will decrease in the foreseeable future
is remote.
2. Year-to-year variability increases greatly from evaporation, to rainfall, to river
flow, to flood peak maxima. This increasing variability in the secondary and
tertiary processes progressively overwhelms other changes that may be present,
but are not detectable. They also increasingly filter out the smaller events. This in
turn enhances the long-term periodicity signal.
3. Short-term serial dependence (less than 10 years) is present in many records. It is
a result of storage and inertia in the hydrometeorological processes. These may be
due to high storage/input ratios, or natural thermal or mechanical inertia of
climatic or oceanic processes. There was no evidence that this could be due to
oscillatory behaviour.
4. There is very strong evidence of long term 21-year periodicity (approximately – it
varies within a narrow range), in annual rainfall and river flows. These sudden,
statistically significant, predictable, periodic reversals from periods of prolonged
drought, to periods of years of high rainfall and river flow, are the result of regular

45

instability in the atmospheric processes. The reversals took place within a year or
two of 1912, 1933, 1954, 1973, and 1995.
Extreme floods
5. The statistical properties of widespread, severe floods are described in detail in
Alexander (2002b). The properties of extreme, flood-producing rainfall are
independent of geographical location, mean annual rainfall, or rainfall seasonality.
Furthermore, extreme floods are the result of weather systems that are not annual
events at any one site. The depth-area-duration-frequency properties of
widespread, severe flood-producing rainfall generated by cut-off lows in the
south-western Cape, are not measurably distinguishable from those generated by
tropical cyclones in the northern regions of South Africa, (Alexander 2002 b). In
this report it is shown that the occurrence of these floods has a periodic pattern
associated with characteristic reversals from droughts to floods.
6. The soil-moisture deficit has to be satisfied before runoff can occur. Evaporation
losses between rainfall events play a dominant role in the rainfall-runoff process.
Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that an increase in rainfall will result in
an increase in the magnitude and frequency of damaging floods. At a number of
sites in South Africa, floods experienced in the mid-1800s remain the highest on
record. This information has to be borne in mind when assessing the effect of
global warming on the frequency and magnitude of severe floods.
7. High loss of life and damage to property in South Africa and elsewhere in the
world in recent years, were the consequence of rising populations and the
associated unavoidable occupation of flood-prone areas. These were worsened by
socio-economic conditions and were not the result of increases in flood magnitude
or frequency, (Alexander 1999). For this reason, increases in insurance payments
in recent years, cannot be used as indicators of increases in the magnitude and
frequency of floods.
Extreme droughts
8. It is not sufficient to predict increases in the severity of floods and droughts based
on an assumed increase in the variability of atmospheric processes. Floods and
droughts are altogether different and unrelated hydrological phenomena. Floods
have durations measured in days and are embedded within annual river flows.
They can therefore be modelled as annual events. In contrast, droughts are multiyear phenomena and are not simply combinations of independent annual
occurrences. The degree of serial dependence of the annual values plays a
dominant role in the duration of droughts, and therefore their magnitudes.
Predictions of increases in the magnitude and frequency of droughts will remain
suspect until the serial dependence structure has been determined, and changes in
this structure have been demonstrated.

46

9. The corresponding multi-year periods of below average river flow during the
latter half of the 21-year periods, will have an appreciable detrimental effect on
the calculated assurance of the yield of storage dams, if they are not taken into
account in the yield-capacity analyses. The multi-year negative departure from the
long-term mean annual precipitation associated with this periodicity, is the direct
cause of prolonged historical droughts. There is no evidence to support the
postulated increase in the magnitude and severity of these droughts in recent
years. It is not the droughts that are becoming progressively more extreme, but the
socio-economic conditions of the poor communities that depend on the natural
environment for their survival, (Alexander 1999).
Finally
10. The oscillatory characteristics reported in the literature are not present in the data.
They are artefacts of the spectral analysis methods used in the analyses.
11. The serial dependence, periodicity and the abnormalities in the behaviour of the
mean described in this report should provide valuable information on linkages
between climatic processes and hydrometeorological responses. Conversely, if no
such linkages are found, it is most unlikely that it will be possible to provide
credible relationships between climate change scenarios and hydrometeorological
responses.
12. There is no evidence in the analyses to support the view that global warming
will result in decreases in rainfall, or increases in the frequency and severity
of floods and droughts within the next 50 years. All evidence is to the
contrary.

47

PART 2: EVALUATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE
SCIENCE
15. Summary of Part 2
My position in this whole climate change situation can be summarised in six short
statements.
1. Natural climate variability is real and serious.
2. There is no believable evidence to support the view that human activities
have in the past, or will in the foreseeable future, increase the rate of global
warming to the extent that it will meaningfully increase the undesirable
effects of natural climate variability.
3. Global climate models are inherently incapable of producing reliable
predictions on the time and space scales required for practical applications,
and have been seriously misused.
4. There is no believable evidence to support the many alarmist claims based on
abstract process theory and highly suspect global climate models.
5. National efforts should therefore be directed towards adaptation and
ameliorative measures. This important research direction is being hampered
by the unfounded alarmist claims by many, but not all, climate change
scientists.
6. It would be a serious mistake for the South African authorities to implement
costly greenhouse gas emission control measures, based on the flimsy
available evidence and unreliable global climate models.
16. Introduction to Part 2
16.1.The issues
Climate is continually changing on all time and space scales. The issue is whether or not
recent changes (say during the past 100 years) have been influenced by human activities,
and if so to what extent. Regardless of the causes of climate variability, accommodating
this variability in practical applications has to be addressed as a matter of high priority.
I am in the fortunate position where I have a life-long experience in this field in both
theory and practice. I believe that as a result of this experience, I am able to undertake
these internationally important studies, and evaluate the work of natural scientists
involved in these fields.

48

16.2.The processes
All climatic processes are driven in the first instance by incoming solar radiation, its
global redistribution, and its eventual discharge back into space. The solar energy input
per square kilometre of the earth's surface is greatest at the tropics and least at the poles.
This creates an energy gradient. With this gradient exists, the poleward movement of this
energy must take place. The two principal means of energy transport are via the oceanic
and atmospheric processes.
The principal terrestrial consequence of this energy redistribution process is rainfall. This
is the source of water that is essential for all forms of terrestrial life - humans, animals
and plants.
16.3.Observation theory vs process theory
Observation theory is as old as civilisation itself. The design of every structure exposed
to the forces of nature and every storage dam on a river designed to supply water, is
based on an analysis of recorded data. Process theory, which is the study of the
atmospheric processes that produce the rainfall and therefore river flow, does not feature
in the design of these structures anywhere in the world.
The longest continuous hydrological record is the observations of the flow in the Nile
River at Cairo in Egypt. A gauging structure was built on Rodda Island in 941 AD. In
1950 the civil engineer R E Hurst analysed 1080 years of data from the Rodda Nilometer,
which he used to determine the required storage capacity of the proposed new Aswan
High Dam. He found an unexplained anomaly in the data. He then analysed other long
geophysical records, where he found the same anomaly. These were sediment deposits in
lakes (2000 years), river flow (1080 years), tree rings (900 years), temperature (175
years), rainfall (121 years), sunspots and wheat prices. This anomaly became known as
the Hurst Phenomenon, or Hurst’s Ghost.
It is of particular relevance to this report, to note that this anomalous behaviour based on
over a thousand years of continuous records, is obviously related to climatic
perturbations. It is present in sediment deposits in lakes, river flow, tree rings,
temperature, rainfall, sunspots and wheat prices.
Hurst’s observations of the anomalies in very long records of proxy data created a great
deal of interest in the years that followed. Although it was obvious that the unusual
characteristics were caused by climatic processes, no serious attempt was made to
identify the source of the problem by analysing climatic processes. This would not have
been possible in the absence of climatological data.
In contrast, climatology is a young science and is based on abstract process theory
supported by limited measurements. Traditionally, one of the main thrusts of climatology
has been the study of climate on a geological time scale extending many thousands of
years back in time. It is therefore understandable that climatologists interested in climate
change science chose to use centuries-old proxy data such as data derived from ice cores
and tree rings, to develop linkages between climate and the terrestrial consequences.

49

Recently, computer-based, complex mathematical global climate models (GCMs), were
developed to predict future climatic trends, including in particular the influence of
undesirable greenhouse gas emissions arising from industrial and other activities. There is
a fundamental weakness in this approach. It has resulted in the present inability of
climate change scientists to persuade nations to undertake very costly measures to reduce
dangerous greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change scientists have chosen to follow the
process theory route in their studies. They are predicting serious consequences including
increases in floods and the reduction of rainfall, river flow and thereby water supplies,
which have no foundation in fact.
This jump from atmospheric processes to the hydrological consequences completely
ignores observation theory applied to the wealth of readily available data. Hydrologists
have been aware of climate-related anomalies in the hydrological data for at least half a
century. No attempts were made by climate change scientists to address the causes of
these anomalies for the simple reason that they were not aware of them.
A very good example is the statistically significant and hydrologically meaningful
variations in rainfall, river flow and floods that are directly attributable to corresponding
variations in solar activity. Statements are made in the IPCC documentation that
variations in solar activity are too small to influence climate. My studies described in
Part 1 of this report demonstrate that solar activity is the dominant cause of multi-year
variations in the hydrometeorological processes. I determined that the consequences of
human activities on these processes are undetectable.
The net result is that climate change scientists have been unable to produce any
believable evidence to support their alarmist claims. There is one very simple test. The
rate of discharge of dangerous greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere has increased at an
exponential rate during the past 50 years. If the consequences are as dramatic as claimed,
then the evidence of this should be clear and unambiguous in the principal climatic
responses – those of rainfall, river flow and floods. As demonstrated in Part 1 above,
there is no believable evidence of any undesirable changes.
It is ironical that fifty years ago civil engineers observed and reported anomalies in long
hydrological records. This caused them to examine proxy data where they found the same
anomalies. Now, fifty years later climate change scientists completely ignored both the
wealth of hydrological data as well as the well-reported multiyear anomalies in the data.
They have developed complex models of the global climate based on suspect proxy data
to predict adverse changes in the hydrological processes, for which there is no believable
evidence.
Another issue is that process theory is fundamentally incapable of producing predictions
in a numerical format required for adaptation studies, particularly hydrometeorological
time series.
Climate change scientists should not be surprised when experienced civil engineers
maintain that the GCM predictions are no more than unreliable, untested hypotheses.

50

16.4.Confusion in terminology
Another major philosophical hindrance is that the phrase climate change is not
adequately defined, particularly as climate is never constant on any time or space scale.
A preferable description is climate variability. Variability can be quantified numerically
while change is a descriptive term that has no numerically quantifiable meaning.
Unfortunately, the term ‘climate change’ has become associated with human causes and
has lost its general meaning.
17. No basis for alarmist claims
On 5 May 2005 the office of the South African Minister of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism (DEAT) issued a press release titled South Africa braces for impacts of climate
change: major conference to be held in October. Many local newspapers and magazines
carried excerpts from the release in articles on climate change. The emphases are mine.
It contained a statement that:
The simple truth however is that the climate is everyone's concern, as over the
next 50 years it may well define the worst social, economic and environmental
challenges ever faced.

It went on to say that:
Climate change could lead to provinces such Mapumalanga, Limpopo, the NorthWest, KwaZulu Natal and even Gauteng becoming malaria zones by 2050. In
less than 100 years, the research indicates that thousands of plant species may
well be extinct starting with a massive reduction in the distribution of fynbos and
succulent Karoo biomes. With clean water resources becoming increasingly
scarce, small-scale agriculture as likely to be hard hit with less rainfall in certain
regions and too much in others. In short, climate change will intensify the worst
effects of poverty through losses in biodiversity, agriculture, health and almost
every sector of society. The government climate change response strategy kicks
off with a series of events in October, including a conference of African scientists
with a national conference on climate change.

Other postulated threats were rising sea levels and expanding deserts. No solutions were
offered. If this view is sound, then South Africa is on the brink of a national disaster. I
can hardly think of a more alarmist statement of national policy. As I demonstrate below,
these claims are completely unfounded.
17.1.Temperature has increased
In their paper Temperature trends in South Africa: 1960-2003 Kruger and Shongwe
(2004) reported that 23 of the 26 climate stations analysed showed positive temperature
trends. Two warm phases were identified: the first was from the mid-1930s to the late
1940s, and the second was from the early 1980s to the end of the period of study. The
trends in the annual mean temperature were at the lower end of the range 0,1 to 0,3 0C per
decade. This is equivalent to an increase of 1 0C to 3 0C per century.
They also found that the trends had not themselves increased during the past decade. This
is notwithstanding the IPCC (2001) statement that the 1990s was the warmest decade and

51

1998 the warmest year in the instrumental record. Nevertheless, the increase in South
African temperatures correlates well with the global trend.
By definition, temperature is the most emphasised consequence of global warming but
there are some problems. Firstly, temperature is a measure, not a process. It has to be
coupled with something. For example, air temperature at various levels of the
atmosphere, sea surface temperature, land surface temperature, the vertical temperature
profile of water in a dam, and so on. Secondly, it is a measure of heat energy. Heat energy
in turn is one of several forms of energy. The energy cycle illustrated earlier in this report
shows how energy is transformed from one form to another during the various
atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial processes.
If glaciers and ice caps are melting this is confirmation a global increase of air
temperature. But this is meaningless in itself. The linkage between increase in air
temperature and all the other undesirable consequences still has to be demonstrated by
observation and not simply postulated by contestable theory.
17.2.Evaporation has increased
Solar radiation is converted to heat energy when it strikes a heat-absorbent surface such
as water, soil and vegetation. If water is present, its temperature will increase and some of
the heat energy will be converted to latent heat of evaporation, as water is lost to the
immediate atmosphere.
Incoming solar radiation drives the system. Its effects can be reduced by cloud cover, but
never increased. Evaporative losses are also dependent on the movement of warm, dry air
across the water surface. This also has an upper limit. Taken together, there is a
maximum, upper limit to evaporation losses from open water, soil and vegetation. This
maximum is approached in the hot, dry, cloudless conditions experienced in arid and
semiarid climates.
My studies of 1176 years of data from 20 representative observation stations showed that
there was an increase in evaporation at 14 stations, no change at two stations, and a
decrease at four stations.
In a paper discussed below, it is stated that GCM outputs predict a quadrupling of the
evaporation over a large, semiarid region of the African subcontinent. Quadrupling of
evaporation losses in a semiarid region is physically impossible and casts serious doubts
on the reliability of the GCMs and the knowledge of those who accepted the results.
17.3.Rainfall has increased
Rainfall over the southern parts of the region (southern Africa), as a whole has
shown no large systematic linear trends during the twentieth century. (Tyson and
Gatebe 2001.)
We note that the assertions made (by Prof. Alexander) are, perhaps, not
surprising given the approach used to analyse the data. For example, to analyse
mean annual rainfall (MAP) over South Africa is to ignore the fact that the region
is subject to strong climatic gradients, responding to widely differing atmospheric
processes on different sub-annual time scales and compounded by highly
variable landscape. (From a letter with ten signatories to the editor of Water

52

Wheel of May/June 2004 in response to my earlier viewpoint article Climate
change: there is no need for concern.)

I was the first person to report a sustained increase in the rainfall over South Africa based
on a study of 7141 years of district rainfall data. This contradicts the statement by Tyson
and Gatebe that there has been no change. Why was my observation of an increase
challenged by the spurious arguments in the above responses? Surely this is good news.
This denial of the beneficial consequences of global warming has become a trademark of
climate change scientists.
In 1948, forty years before the establishment of the IPCC, the Department of Irrigation
published a 160-page memoir by the civil engineer D F Kokot titled An investigation
into evidence bearing on recent climatic changes over southern Africa, (Kokot 1948). It
contained 418 references, including reports by early travellers and missionaries. He found
no evidence of a general decrease in rainfall or river flow, despite increases in CO2
emissions. He concluded that there was no evidence of a linkage between CO2 emissions
and rainfall over South Africa.
The report of the Desert Encroachment Committee appointed by the Minister of
Agriculture was published in 1951. (Note that this investigation was undertaken in a
drought period preceding the 1954 reversal.) This was a thorough multidisciplinary report
by a team of South Africa’s leading scientists. They concluded that there was no
evidence of a general decrease in the rainfall in South Africa that could be attributed to
climate change.
In 1993 the University of Pretoria hosted a discussion group organised by the Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) on the possible effect of climate change on water
resources. Differences of opinion were expressed, but one of the conclusions was that
climate change was likely to increase rainfall, not decrease it. This conclusion was
eight years before the IPCC (2001) policy statement.
The results of my recent investigations show that there has been a sustained increase in
the mean annual rainfall over South Africa from 497 mm to 543 mm during the 78-year
period of continuous district rainfall records. This agrees very well with the IPCC figure
of a worldwide increase of between 0,5 to 1% per decade during the 20th century. My
observation is reinforced by the concurrent increase in open water surface evaporation,
which increases atmospheric water content. This leads to the conclusion that any
additional global warming will further increase the annual rainfall over South Africa, not
decrease it. This is in accordance with current international observations and opinions.
This fact negates climate change scenarios that postulate a decrease in rainfall.
The comments by the writers of the letter published in Water Wheel quoted above
unwittingly support my view. If the increases are present, despite the strong climatic
gradients and widely differing atmospheric processes, this must surely strengthen my
position, not weaken it.
Over almost the whole of South Africa the annual rainfall consists of a mixture of
discrete high and low rainfall events. But it is the high rainfall events that saturate the
soils, sustain natural vegetation, provide moisture for agricultural crops and generate

53

river flow. The low rainfall events make a minimal contribution to these processes. An
increase in rainfall variability will result in an increase in rainfall from high rainfall
events and will therefore be beneficial.
The claims that the seasonal and daily properties of rainfall may have been adversely
affected by global warming despite the general increase in rainfall are illogical. This is
because the increase is the consequence of the increase in the frequency of beneficial,
widespread, heavy rainfall events.
Elementary physics

Then there is the matter of elementary physics and logical deduction. Surely, everybody
knows that an increase in global temperature must result in an increase in evaporation
from the oceans, lakes, dams, rivers, vegetation and the soil. It is equally obvious that all
this excess moisture must return to earth in the form of increased rainfall. There is no
theoretical or observational justification for the assumption that global warming will
decrease South African rainfall, whether annual, seasonal or daily.
I return to this subject again below.
18. The consequences of global warming
The following are my responses to the alarmist claims made in press statements issued by
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) and other reports.
It is NOT the purpose of these comments to criticise the researchers. My objective is to
highlight what I believe are serious shortcomings in their assumptions relating to the
interactions between climatological processes and the natural environment responses. All
of this is within the context that these research findings are being used to justify
drastic measures that will inevitably have an adverse effect on the prosperity of the
peoples of this country.
18.1.Global warming will not spread malaria
Climate change could lead to provinces such Mapumalanga, Limpopo, the NorthWest, KwaZulu Natal and even Gauteng becoming malaria zones by 2050.
(DEAT press release 5 May 2005.)

It has been claimed that global warming will result in the spread of malaria to areas
where it is not present in South Africa. When I was a child living outside Durban I slept
under a mosquito net. I slept under a mosquito net again during the war at Tripoli on the
edge of the Sahara desert. A year later I contracted malaria south of Florence in Italy. A
few months later I slept under mosquito nets again on the Adriatic coast of Italy, which
experienced winter snows. There could hardly be a greater climatic contrast between the
heat of the Sahara Desert and the snows of Italy. When I presented my views, I received a
response that the mosquito species in North Africa and Italy, were different from those in
South Africa!
Climate change scientists must surely be aware of the thorough study by Paul Reiter
Climate change and mosquito-borne disease published in 2001. The twenty-page report

54

has 189 references. He provides interesting historical information on the prevalence in
northern hemisphere cold climates as well as the DDT fiasco. Malaria occurred
throughout Europe during the Ice Age of the 16th and 17th centuries. I contracted it in Italy
in 1944. Since then it has been eradicated from Europe.
Reiter’s concluding comment was:
The natural history of mosquito-borne diseases is complex, and the interplay of
climate, ecology, vector biology, and many other factors defies simplistic analysis.
The recent resurgence of many of these diseases is a major cause for concern,
but it is facile to attribute this resurgence to climate change. The principal
determinants are politics, economics, and human activities. A creative and
organised application of resources is urgently required to control these diseases
regardless of future climate change.

I have also received a lot of information from professional colleagues. Returning closer to
home, only 16 deaths were reported in South Africa in 1974. This was the year before
DDT was banned. Twenty years after the banning of DDT, the death toll rose to thirteen
thousand per year. Another personally interesting statistic is that in KwaZulu-Natal in
1932 when I spent my nights under a mosquito net, the annual death toll was between
10 000 and 22 000. Malaria was later eradicated by DDT.
I have been informed that most countries in southern Africa either already have DDT
spraying programmes or are about to introduce them. Where DDT has been introduced
there has been a dramatic decrease in the incidence of malaria. There is also no evidence
that DDT is harmful to human beings. The Department of Health has produced figures
showing the numbers of cases and deaths per annum for the Northern Province,
Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the rest of South Africa for the years 1999 to 2004. For
South Africa as a whole, the total deaths were 406, 458, 119, 96, 142, 89, and 36.
What then is the basis for this claim that climate change could result in a reintroduction
of malaria into areas in South Africa where it was once prevalent but has since been
eradicated by chemical and other control measures? No reasonable person could possibly
agree with this patently alarmist and illogical claim.
The question then arises. Did those who made this alarmist statement make any effort to
study the wealth of literature on this subject, or even more importantly, discuss the issue
with South African experts in this field? If not, then why not?
18.2.Global warming will not result in desertification
The drier parts could even resemble the Sahara, and South Africa could end up
looking like Mauretania, Mali and Chad, where desertification is so serious, the
camel is the most reliable form of transport. (Introduction to Futures of the Karoo
conference 1978.)

In 1925 the Department of Agriculture published a detailed report The great drought
problem of South Africa. The report was presented by a five-person commission of
enquiry appointed by the government in 1920.
The following quote from the study is repeated here.
…the Commission states that two points seem firmly established: firstly that a
large portion of South Africa was dry long before (settlers from Europe) arrived,

55

as evidenced by the name “Karroo” and by the highly specialised droughtresisting flora of that region; and secondly, that since then enormous tracts of the
country have been entirely or partly denuded of their original vegetation…(as a
result of poor farming practices.)
The simple unadorned truth is sufficiently terrifying without the assistance of
rhetoric. The logical outcome of all is ‘The Great South African Desert’
uninhabitable by man.

This is the first reference to the desertification of the sub-continent – a recurring theme
that continues to the present day. This is despite the fact that there has been no
desertification of any region of South Africa since the prediction was first made 80 years
ago. Note also the specific reference to drought resisting flora. I return to this later.
In 1953 J Acocks produced his Veld Types map of South Africa and the phrase of the
‘marching desert’ became popular. The government introduced several measures such as
stock reduction schemes, while farmers introduced rotational grazing procedures. The
situation is now under control.
In the 1970s, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary, the World Meteorological
Organisation predicted that the rainfall over large areas of South Africa would decrease
as a result of global cooling, and desert conditions would prevail.
A conference on The future of the Karoo was held in Graaff-Reinet in November 1978. I
was one of seven invited speakers. The title of my presentation was Man, water and the
soil, (Alexander 1978). The reason for the conference was the alarm caused by the report
by the World Meteorological Organisation.
According to the World Meteorological Organisation, our beautiful land is turning
into a desert. They say the Karoo is expanding at such an alarming rate that by
2050, it could reach Mafeking and Vereeniging in the north, East London in the
east and Barkly West in the west.
The drier parts could even resemble the Sahara, and South Africa could end up
like Mauretania, Mali and Chad, where desertification is so serious, the camel is
the most reliable form of transport, and the remaining arable lands cannot
support the population, so hundreds of thousands die of starvation and disease.

I informed the conference that the fears were groundless. The only camels in South Africa
are in the zoos.
Remobilisation of the Kalahari sands

The following is an example where the lack of elementary scientific knowledge and
unjustified reliance on global climate models led to a completely false alarmist view. The
claim was that there would be a progressive desertification of a huge area of southern
Africa, including the whole of Botswana and large areas of South Africa, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Zambia, during the present century as a result of uncontained
climate change. This claim was made by Thomas, Knight and Wiggs in their article in
Nature Remobilization of southern African desert dune systems by twenty-first century
global warming (2005). It is very impressive on the surface with 17 figures and 29
references.
The Kalahari sands are the most extensive body of sand in the world. They stretch from
Upington in the south, beyond the Caprivi and into Angola and Zaire in the north. They

56

include eastern Namibia, virtually the whole of Botswana and western Zimbabwe. The
climate ranges from near desert conditions in the south, grasslands in the middle and
dense woodlands in the high rainfall regions in the north.
My favourite travelling companion for many years was Lester King's South African
scenery. Textbook of geomorphology (1963), and more recently ABA Brink's
Engineering geology of southern Africa (1985). Both of them deal with the Kalahari
dunefields in some detail. I have travelled extensively through this area, and have many
photographs showing the vegetal cover. I have also conducted an extensive study of the
geomorphology and vegetal cover of the Caprivi by helicopter and by boat. This is within
the region covered by the authors.
This is a quote from Brink (p175).
Of great interest because of their extremely widespread occurrence are the
superficial cover sands and fossil dunes, which attest to the presence of an
enormous sand sea at a late stage of the history of the Kalahari basin. Today
these sands are mobile only where there are regular sources of fresh sediment,
such as in proximity to the channels of major exotic rivers where disturbance has
taken place. Elsewhere they are stabilised by vegetation, which in north-eastern
Botswana, Angola, western Zambia and Zaire is often thick bush or even tropical
forest.

According to Juta's Magister Atlas for secondary schools (p78) the annual rainfall over
north-eastern Namibia is between 500 mm and 1000 mm and increases northwards into
Angola. The authors' Fig. 1 shows the rainfall to be in the range 400 to 800 mm. This can
by no means be considered to be a desert! In other words, rainfall is not the limiting
factor for vegetation. It is the porous soil that is unable to retain moisture. From this it
follows that a reduction in rainfall will not result in a corresponding reduction in
vegetation.
My major problem with the reasoning of the writers of the article, and others, is the over
simplistic views that they express. Rainfall will decrease, evaporation will increase,
therefore the vegetation will die, therefore the sand will be exposed, therefore the winds
will blow the sand over wide areas of southern Africa. It is all the unaddressed
‘therefores’ that are the problem.
Here is extract from the paper.
Empirical data and model simulations established that the interplay between
dune surface erodibility (determined by vegetation cover and moisture
availability) and atmospheric erosivity (determined by wind energy) is critical for
dunefield dynamics. This relationship between erodibility and erosivity is
susceptible to climate change impacts.

They used simulations with three global climate models and a range of emission
scenarios to assess the potential future activity of three Kalahari dunefields. They found
that, regardless of the emission scenario used, significantly enhanced dune activity is
simulated in the southern dunefield by 2039, and in the eastern and northern dunefields
by 2069. By 2099 all dunefields are highly dynamic, from northern South Africa to
Angola and Zambia with very serious consequences to the peoples of this vast region.

57

All these conclusions rested on the basic assumption that the existing vegetation would
be destroyed by climate change. Without the removal of the vegetation, the sand in the
fossil dunes cannot be eroded and transported by wind activity. The destruction of the
protective vegetation is the central issue, but was completely ignored in the paper.
In northern and eastern areas, the dunes are heavily vegetated, including mixed deciduous
woodland in places, owing to higher precipitation levels. How can climate change
possibly reduce this to a desert? Precisely what changes in rainfall and evaporation did
the authors postulate will lead to the destruction of all the natural vegetation over this
huge area of southern Africa and lead to the claimed ‘catastrophic’ results?
In is only in a single paragraph that rainfall and evaporation changes are mentioned for
the first and only time in the paper although these are the key factors in the whole
process. This is what it said. Note the very large differences in the outputs from the
different GCMs.
The first GCM predicted the doubling of potential evaporation over southern Africa,
[this is physically impossible] by 2100 but no mention is made of rainfall.
An older model predicted a 50% decline in summer rainfall in the northern areas
accompanied by a quadrupling of potential evaporation. [Impossible.]
A newer model predicted a 50% increase in rainfall and a smaller increase in potential
evaporation but the potential evaporation still exceeded the rainfall.
Now at last the penny dropped. Because their assumption is so fundamentally absurd and
incomprehensible I missed it all along. The writers maintained that because all models
predicted an increase in potential evapotranspiration that exceeded any change in rainfall
in all scenarios, this would result in the destruction of all the protective vegetation even if
the rainfall increases by 50%, i.e. to more than 1000 mm per annum in the northern areas.
They clearly did not understand the meaning of the word ‘potential’.
Potential evaporation exceeds rainfall over virtually the whole of South Africa. The
authors were apparently blissfully unaware of this fact, and assumed that if potential
evaporation exceeds the rainfall, no vegetation can survive. This is the foundation on
which their paper is based.
I do not for one moment believe that in an area that presently receives an annual rainfall
between 500 and 1000 mm; and is well vegetated; will lose all its vegetal cover; exposing
the underlying readily erodable sand; which will cause the dunes to be reactivated and
invade large areas of southern Africa – all because the GCMs predict an increase in
potential evapotranspiration.
There is no believable foundation for the claim that:
…changes in the erodibility and erosivity of the dune system (arising from climate
change) suggests that the environmental and social consequences of these
changes will be drastic.

No reasonable observer would agree that these extensive, well covered, Kalahari sands
could by any means be converted into a treeless, sandy desert within a matter of decades.
This is absurd.

58

I have dealt with this paper in some detail as it is an example of unfounded conclusions
based on a fundamental lack of knowledge of the critical processes. In the light of the
seriousness of the claims, one would have expected a much more robust and watertight
presentation. Claims such as these are then quoted as being reliable because they have
passed through the peer-review process.
18.3.Global warming will not result in a loss of habitat and species
In less than 100 years, the research indicates that thousands of plant species
may well be extinct starting with a massive reduction in the distribution of fynbos
and succulent Karoo biomes. (DEAT 5 May 2005.)

My knowledge in the fields of zoology, botany and meteorology is limited. Nor have I
carried out literature surveys on this subject. However, I coordinated research in these
fields for a number of years when I held the position of Manager of Scientific Services in
DWAF and served on several national research coordinating bodies.
As the issue relates to global warming, it is natural to consider temperature as the
dominant variable of interest. This in itself is a problem because temperature is a
measure, not a process. Nor does it have upper or lower limits. Temperature has to be
associated with something. In this report it is assumed that temperature refers to air
temperature close to ground level unless defined otherwise. It should also be noted that:


The changes in temperature postulated in the IPCC documentation are very small
when considered against the high, natural, hour-to-hour, day-to-day, year-to-year
and multiyear variability over most of South Africa.



It is rainfall, not temperature that determines the habitability of our planet,
including animal and plant species. Those species that thrive in hot, dry regions
have adapted to the harsh and highly variable temperature and rainfall conditions.



In the arid regions, local heat energy is primarily derived directly from solar
radiation, not ambient air temperature. Ambient air temperature acts as a
coolant, not a heating mechanism.



The role of increase in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is also of interest as
CO2 is beneficial to plant growth.
Therefore, it is essential that concurrent changes in all four driving processes as well as
the responses of the natural species to these complex and interacting driving variables
have to be included in the prediction models. This is by no means a simple exercise or
experiment. The complex interrelationships between the driving variables and the
responses are themselves highly variable. The authors below made no attempt to develop
simulation models that incorporated these variables and processes. Their sole criterion
was a postulated increase in average annual air temperature.
The second aspect that is not sufficiently accommodated in these studies is the highly
variable nature of temperature on all time scales from minutes through to decades.
Indigenous species have adapted to this variability, so temperature changes of the order

59

postulated in climate change scenarios are very small in relation to the daily ranges of
temperature in vulnerable regions.
The third aspect is the stated or implied ‘delicate balance of nature’ when the very
opposite is true. Nature is inherently robust, not delicate, and is never in a state of
equilibrium. The harsher the climate, the more robust the species that inhabit it.
The fourth aspect relates to shortcomings in analytical methodology based on abstract
process theory.
It needs no more than a glance at the daily weather forecast on TV to note that the
predicted (IPCC 2001) increase in global temperature of between 1.4 and 5.8 0C during
the next 100 years is only a fraction of the difference between the daily maximum and
minimum temperatures at any specific place in South Africa. The postulated temperature
increase is also of the same order as the difference in climate between Johannesburg and
Pretoria North. It is very difficult to accept that this small increase in the average annual
temperature could result in the wholesale destruction of habitat and species.
The following are comments on two papers by National Botanical Institute scientists and
co-authors, in which it is concluded that global warming could endanger the survival of
the Cape fynbos and succulent Karoo species. These two consequences of global
warming have been used to justify the view that global warming could cause irreparable
damage to these biomes and habitats, and that large public expenditures to counter global
warming are thereby justified. These issues must therefore be considered very
seriously.
Threat to fynbos biomes

There are several disturbing features in the Hannah et al (2005) paper The view from the
Cape: extinction risk, protected areas, and climate change in which the threats to the
fynbos species are described. The first is that the phrase ‘climate change’ is repeated
many times and is the main theme of the paper, but nowhere is ‘climate’ defined. The
only climatic property referred to is air temperature but nowhere are the changes in
temperature quantified. There is no reference at all to sustained increases in rainfall
described in this report, although its role must surely be at least equal to, if not greater
than changes in air temperature. There are no maps to identify the location of the
threatened areas, or maps of mean annual temperatures or rainfall. These omissions can
only create doubts in the minds of concerned readers.
The second is that the projected changes are derived from down-scaled GCM outputs.
The GCMs are not even capable of producing reliable results of the rainfall for the southwestern Cape as a whole let alone for small areas. It has been predicted that rainfall
south-western Cape will decrease whereas there were substantial increases in the past and
these increases will continue as long as global temperatures keep increasing. This is
discussed in more detail below.
These omissions must raise doubts in the minds of a impartial observers.
The title of the paper and references to climate change should have referred to
temperature changes, not climate changes. The two are not synonymous.

60

Threat to Karoo biomes

Similarly, Musil et al (2005) in their paper Lethal effects of experimental warming
approximating a future climate scenario on southern African quartz-field succulents: a
pilot study, describe a limited experiment where the air temperature in the immediate
vicinity of the plants was forced to rise by enclosing them in 18 transparent hexagonal
open-top chamber arrays.
There is no reference to the effect of rainfall other than a single sentence:
Change predicted future warming and aridity trends sufficient to cause large
reductions in species richness in Mediterranean climate Fynbos and Succulent
Karoo biomes…(My emphasis.)

But rainfall has increased over most of the area and will continue to increase in future, so
the reference to aridity trends is incorrect and unsubstantiated. This obviously casts
doubts on the validity of the conclusions.
Nor is there any mention of the fact that these chambers prevented the movement of air in
the immediate vicinity of the plants. This is essential for the transpiration and
consequently the movement of fluid through the plants. The enclosure of the plants must
inevitably have an adverse effect by suppressing this essential process. This was not
mentioned in the paper.
The next unreported issue is that the ambient temperature in the Karoo is directly related
to solar energy input and not the influx of air from elsewhere. Visualise an experiment
where two spanners (say) are placed next to one another. One in the shade of a shrub and
the other in the sun next to it. If the temperatures of the two spanners are measured, they
will be very different from one another. This is because the temperature of the one in the
shade is controlled by the ambient air temperature and the one in the sun by solar
radiation.
Another personal experience is that all our houses on construction projects in the Karoo
had corrugated iron roofs. The sheets would expand when the sun shone and contract
when a cloud passed in front of the sun. It was quite noisy, and we used to say that the
roofs were 'talking' to us. Clearly the heat from solar radiation was considerably more
than the ambient air temperature. All proof that was needed was to move in and out of the
shade on a sunny day.
In hot, dry, arid regions movement of the ambient air acts as a coolant and is unrelated to
the effects of global warming. The plants in the enclosures died because they were cut off
from the cooling effect of surrounding air movement, not because of the increase in
temperature. What then is the effect of the postulated increase in temperature arising from
global warming when most of the heat energy in arid regions is directly from solar
radiation and the ambient air acts as a coolant and not a heating mechanism?
In addition to the above, it must surely be obvious to anybody who has lived in the Karoo
or observed the environmental processes, that it is the temperature extremes that
determine the survival of plant life, not the annual averages.
The authors stress that this was a pilot project. It was based on 18 small chambers that
excluded all movement of cooling air, at a particular site, and specific plant species. But

61

that is not how it was interpreted by the South African authorities. This is very
important as the public and the decision-making authorities, in my opinion, are
being seriously misled by these grossly unscientific experiments.
18.4. Changes in rainfall in the southern and western Cape
How important is the omission of references to changes in rainfall resulting from global
warming in the above studies? Fig. 13 is an analysis of the annual rainfall for District 5 in
the centre of the south-western Cape region. (See Fig. 14 below.)

Figure 13. Annual rainfall for District 5 in the Western Cape from 1923 to 2000.

A very clear increase in rainfall is evident in both the histogram and the cusp shape of the
accumulated departure plot. There is also a statistically significant 20-year periodicity.
There is an indication of an accelerated increase after 1972. None of this very important
climatological information was provided in the studies discussed above.
During January 2005 the SAWS kindly provided me with the recently revised district
rainfall data for the period 1940 to 2004. This is shorter than the previous record from
1923 to 2000. Other than Districts 14 (no data for the 1950s) and 58 (Lesotho) the
analyses are complete.

62

I carried out a few calculations using the data supplied by the SAWS. It only took about
four hours. I analysed the data for districts 1 to 20 in the western and southern Cape,
which include the fynbos and the succulent Karoo regions. (See Fig. 14 below.) I divided
the data for each district into three equal 21-year periods. These were from 1940 to 1960,
1961 to 1981, and 1982 to 2002 (inclusive). The use of 21-year periods neutralises the
effect of the statistically significant 21-year periodicity in the data, which in turn is
directly related to corresponding changes in solar activity.
Two years 2003 and 2004 were omitted in the first round of analyses. I then selected the
lowest of these two remaining years and compared them with the ranked data. For
example, the rainfall in District 1 for 2003 was the 5th lowest during the 65 years of
record. The results are shown in Table 13. The rainfalls are in millimetres.
Fig. 14 below shows the location of the South African rainfall districts. Fig. 15 shows the
percentage increases in rainfall in the 20 districts within the south-western Cape. Table 13
shows the progressive increase in rainfall during the period of record. This information
completely negates the view that future conditions in the south-western Cape will be drier
than at present.

63

indicate decreases.)

The letters ‘s’ an ‘f’ indicate districts with succulent Karoo and fynbos biomes occur in
the above figure and Table 13. Note the substantial percentage increases in the annual
rainfall in all but four districts in Figure 15 and Table 13..
Note the wide range of rainfall conditions where these species thrive. Authors of the
alarmist reports failed to provide this information or the equivalent annual temperatures.

Interpretation of the facts
The midpoints of the 21-year sequences are 1950, 1971 and 1992. The details in the table
demonstrate the following:
 There was a 17% (57 mm) increase in regional rainfall during the 42-year period
1950 to 1992, and a greater increase during the whole period of record.
 Only four districts showed a decrease in rainfall during the period of record.
 The other 15 districts with complete records all showed increases within the range
of +2% to +68%.
 The regional rainfall showed a consistent increase from the first to the second to
the third periods.
 In not a single district was either the 2003 or 2004 rainfall the driest on record.
For the region as a whole, the average of the worst of these two years was only
the 16th lowest on record.
This very simple analysis showed that except for the three districts (1, 2 and 3) along the
west coast, and the single district (12) on the south coast, all other districts in the western
and southern Cape, including those in which the fynbos and large areas of the succulent
Karoo are located, exhibited consistent increases in rainfall during the period of record.

65

The SAWS weather station at Cape Agulhas at the southernmost tip of the African
continent also recorded an increase in temperature during this period. Furthermore, it is
reasonable to assume that CO2 has also increased. If all three of these principal elements
that affect plant growth have increased for the past 65 years, what is the basis for the NBI
authors’ alarmist predictions? Furthermore, if the rainfall analysis shows that there has
been a sustained increase in rainfall during the past 65 years, and that this increase will
continue as long as global warming continues, what weight should be placed on the
allegation that:
In less than 100 years, the research indicates that thousands of plant species
may well be extinct starting with a massive reduction in the distribution of fynbos
and succulent Karoo biomes. (DEAT 5 May 2005.)

The information above clearly illustrates that these alarmist predictions are invalid.
Finally, why did the NBI scientists not carry out the simple analyses described here using
the district rainfall data that has been available since the 1970s? The analyses would have
taken less than a day to perform, and do not require any numerical expertise other than
simple arithmetic. This would have demonstrated the unreliability of global climate
models and consequent invalid conclusions in their papers.
18.5.Climate change in the Western Cape
With the above in mind, consider the detailed, 155-page report A status quo,
vulnerability and adaptation assessment of the physical and socio-economic effects of
climate change in the Western Cape was prepared by 15 authors from seven institutions
in June 2005, (Midgley et al 2005). Under normal circumstances this report should carry
heavy weight. Unfortunately a single fundamental issue on which the report is based is
demonstrably false and completely undermines the scientific integrity of the report and
all the conclusions drawn from it.
The very foundation of the report is that global warming will reduce rainfall over the
entire region. This assumption is based entirely on global climate model outputs, whereas
a simple analysis of the long records of the many rainfall stations in the region shows that
there has been a general increase in rainfall. This was demonstrated above where some
districts show substantial increases of up to 68% during the period of record. As global
warming is reported to have increased steadily during the past century, it follows that
rainfall will continue to increase as long as global temperatures continue to rise.
The following are brief extracts from the introductory section of the report. The emphases
are mine. References to a drier future climate are patently false, as future climate in
this region will be wetter, not drier.
In this study we have carried out a broad reassessment of the vulnerability of the
Western Cape to climate change impacts using a wider range of climate
scenarios from more sophisticated climate models …
The future climate of the Western Cape is likely to be one that is warmer and
drier than at present according to a number of current model predictions.

66

A future that is warmer and possibly drier, will encompass a range of
consequences that will effect the economy, the livelihoods of the people and the
ecological integrity of the Western Cape region.
Projections for the Western Cape are for a drying trend from west to east…[My

analyses demonstrate the opposite. See Fig. 15 above.]
In a warmer and drier future, the competition for fresh water will increase steeply.
The vulnerability of estuaries to warming and drying is particularly acute …
The impact of climate change manifested by a warmer and drier climate are likely
to be a progressive impoverishment in species richness …
A drier environment would restrict the spread of alien invasive species …
The combination of increasing water scarcity, and rising temperatures will also
regularly affect sectors of the economy that are particularly dependent on
ecosystem goods and services, for example agriculture, forestry and fishing.
Economic sectors such as insurance, banks (through the underlying secured
assets), transport and communication infrastructure and construction may all be
affected to some degree by climate change.
Climate variability has been linked to variation in solar activity, i.e. the sunspot
cycle, (Houghton et al (2001). However, recent analyses by Foukal et al (2005)
has called this hypothesis into question, citing the small variation of solar output
(0.8%) that can be attributed to the sunspot cycle and the relatively poor ability of
instruments to measure accurately these variations.

I deal with this in Part 1 above. Solar physicists are entitled to maintain that variations in
solar radiation are too small to account for the linkage between sunspot numbers and
climate. They are not entitled to conclude that no linkage exists. This is the fundamental
difference between process theory and observational theory. Solar activity is the
dominant source of climate variability in South Africa. The results of all analyses
that ignore this are suspect.
The authors do not provide tables of either annual rainfall or annual temperatures
although these are critical issues for their whole presentation. In their Figure 6 they show
a range of temperatures of less than 40C, which is less than the temperature increase from
eight in the morning to midday. Their postulated decrease in rainfall is less than the
difference in annual rainfall at any site between two successive years. To assume that this
combination will result in a warmer and drier climate with all the postulated
consequences is totally unrealistic and unacceptable.
There is more information on historical rainfall in the south-western Cape than in any
other region of South Africa. Why was this wealth of rainfall data not analysed and
anomalies identified and characterised as I have done in this report? This would have
provided a solid base for extrapolation into the future. Instead, their report is replete with
uncertainties and pleas for more research, (i.e. funding).
The above analyses demonstrate the fundamental inability of global climate models
to model South African rainfall on any scale.
It is particularly disappointing to note that the prestigious National Botanical Institute and
the South African Biodiversity Research Institute have associated themselves with these

67

scientifically inadequate studies, and the unfounded, alarmist predictions drawn from
them.
18.6.Global warming will not increase eutrophication
The following extracts are from a viewpoint article by Hart, Ashton and Allanson: Is
climate change really no concern. A call for a more holistic vision. (Water Wheel May/
June 2004.) I was not given the opportunity to respond at the time.
Will Alexander’s viewpoint article suggests that climate change is of no
environmental concern. Flying in the face of contemporary opinion is a brave call.
But we believe it is erroneous. It simplifies, even trivializes, an issue that affects
humanity at large, and demands debate.
As a prominent water resources engineer, Will Alexander cannot be unaware of
thermal stratification events in standing waters, and the eutrophication threats to
our national water resource base. Yet his conclusion disregards any
consideration of the impacts of warming on these crucial issues.
Temperature plays a ubiquitous role in ecology. It is a prime determinant of
habitat suitability for living organisms, and serves as the singularly most
important abiotic dimension of ecological niche for virtually all living organisms.

I am very familiar with the eutrophication problem in many of South Africa’s dams and
associated research. I was responsible for all research conducted by the DWAF
Hydrological Research Institute on this subject and served on the national coordinating
body, the National Programme for Environmental Sciences. My critics were aware of
this. I was also directly involved with the implementation of control measures for a
number of years, including the control of aquatic weeds. I have examined more dams,
lakes and rivers in southern Africa than my critics.
As shown in an earlier section of this report, the rate of increase in air temperature in
South Africa was within the range of 0.1 to 0.3 0C per decade. This is equivalent to the
increase in the temperature from 9 am and 10 am on a sunny day! Did these writers
really expect readers to believe that this very small increase in average temperature of a
water body will have the postulated serious consequences?
Did they expect readers to believe that there would be progressive increase in the
eutrophication or other undesirable biological activity of a series of dams on a river with
their different temperature regimes, for example from Grootdraai Dam to Vaal Dam to
Bloemhof Dam on the Vaal River? Or from Midmar Dam to Albert Falls Dam to Nagle
Dam to Inanda Dam on the Mgeni River? Pongolapoort Dam located in northern
KwaZulu-Natal lowveld is probably the warmest, large, freshwater body in South Africa.
Are eutrophication and other undesirable biological processes greater in this dam than in
any other dam in South Africa?
If these progressive deteriorations are indeed present, why were these not quoted as
examples instead of referring readers to ‘the veritable arsenal of information
documenting these effects’ ?
The same applies to biological activities in a river system. The water temperature will
change progressively from the upper to the lower reaches of a river. Are we expected to

68

believe that the natural biological activities change from acceptable to unacceptable along
the length of the river as the temperature increases?
The implication that increases in average annual water temperature are undesirable, is
unacceptable within the context of the very wide range of temperatures experienced in
South African rivers from east to west, and from north to south, and from day to day.
The growth of undesirable aquatic weeds such as water hyacinth is largely independent of
temperature. I have observed this problem in the dams and lakes from Lake Malawi in the
north, Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River, through to Hartbeespoort Dam in South Africa,
all of which have different temperature regimes.
I was accused of trivialising an issue that affects humanity at large, so let me provide an
interesting observation. The growth of floating water hyacinths in the nutrient rich
Hartbeespoort Dam had become a serious problem for recreational activities, although
these plants had a beneficial effect of suppressing dangerous algal growth. Responding to
public pressure, the Department of Water Affairs agreed to destroy the plants by aerial
spraying. Academic limnologists warned that the dead plants would sink and decay thus
deoxygenate the water in the dam. They predicted that this would result in massive fish
deaths. In the event, the dead plants remained floating until they were completely
decayed and not a single dead fish was found.
18.7.Global warming will not increase soil erosion
It has been claimed that climate change will increase soil erosion, and maps have been
produced showing that soil erosion is greatest in the high rainfall areas. My earlier studies
showed that there has been a decrease of sediment transport in rivers as well as sediment
deposition in dams due to active anti-soil erosion measures. A walk along the hiking trails
of the high rainfall areas of the eastern escarpment from the Drakensberg in South Africa
all the way through to the Rift Valley in Malawi will show crystal clear streams and no
evidence of active soil erosion.
Soil erosion is a natural geomorphological process. It is the result of a sequence of
processes, each of which has to be satisfied before the next occurs. The sequence starts
with the degradation and removal of overlying protective vegetal cover. As global
warming will result in an increase in rainfall this will increase vegetal cover, not diminish
it, and consequently decrease the rate of natural soil erosion where no other factors are
present. In those cases where the protective material has been removed, this will expose
the underlying material. The exposed material must be erodable. If it is solid rock it will
not erode. At the other extreme dispersive soils are highly erodable. Thereafter there must
be a detaching and transporting medium, either flowing water or less frequently, wind.
The velocity of the water must be capable of detaching and transporting the unprotected
and erodable material. This is a complex process. Steep slopes result in high water
velocities and therefore high erosion potential. However, steep slopes have to consist of
non-erodable material otherwise they would have been flattened by natural erosion long
ago. Only when all four conditions have been met can soil erosion occur. There is no
linkage between soil erosion and climate change.

69

18.8.Global warming will not adversely affect agriculture
Maize, wheat, sugar and cotton lands will shift and change, our famous southern
Cape vineyards are likely to shrink, fungal rusts, weevils and worms, along with
parasite-vectoring mosquitoes are likely to change or otherwise change their
distribution ranges – either in space and/or in time. (Hart, Ashton and Allanson
2004)

The authors do not profess to have any knowledge in these fields. Why were experts in
agriculture, entomology and tropical diseases not consulted? There is no foundation for
these alarmist claims.
18.9.Global warming will not result in a drop in food production
There will be a drop in food production including an estimated drop of 20% in
grain production. (DEAT 15 December 2004.)

The 2004/05 maize harvest was the biggest since 1994 and there was a surplus of 4
million tonnes. Maize farmers are now seriously considering using maize surpluses for
the production of ethanol for use as a fuel.
Increases in temperature, rainfall and atmospheric carbon dioxide are beneficial to
agriculture. Why were no experts in these fields consulted? There is no foundation for
this prediction.
18.10.Global warming will not increase health problems
Climate change will have a major impact on our people with health problems like
increased cancer rates. Waterborne diseases will increase. (DEAT 15 December
2004.)

The postulated changes in climate will be no more serious than moving from
Johannesburg to Pretoria, or from Pietermaritzburg to Durban, or vice versa. The
principal risk of incurring skin cancer is exposure to solar radiation, not an increase in
temperature. The risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as cholera is
associated with poor hygiene, not climate.
18.11.Global warming will not increase droughts
Changes in temperature and precipitation regimes in future, particularly in
respect of extreme drought and flood conditions, will have profound effects.
(Tyson and Gatebe, 2001.)

It has been postulated that global warming will result in an increase in the frequency and
magnitude of droughts. The study of the concurrent properties of the annual
hydrometeorological data series was the main thrust of my recent studies reported in
Part 1 above. Sequences of wet and dry years in both rainfall and river flow are natural
phenomena that have been observed and reported since biblical times. I found no support
for the view that global warming will increase the likelihood of droughts in southern
Africa. Such increases that may have been observed are the result of variations in
solar activity, not global warming.

70

18.12.Global warming will not increase floods
Any temperature or rainfall record shows a large variability. The inevitable result
of variability added to higher average temperatures (meaning higher evaporation)
and higher average rainfall will be a greater number and greater intensity of both
droughts and floods. (Houghton 2004.)

Droughts and floods are fundamentally different hydrological phenomena and are not
processes at two ends of a continuous scale. The principal concern regarding droughts is
the long sequences of years of deficient rainfall whereas for floods is their short duration
(measured in hours), magnitude.
Major floods in southern Africa are highly destructive, largely due to the steep slopes of
the rivers and exposure to widespread, severe flood-producing rainfall events, including
tropical cyclones and equally destructive cut-off low-pressure systems. Consequently
research on floods has received more attention than in most other countries of the world.
The floods recorded in the 1850s remain the highest on record in several rivers. In 1856
the Mgeni River overflowed its banks and flowed across the centre of Durban and into
Durban harbour.
Climate change does not feature in research on floods as any change, should it be present,
would be overwhelmed by the natural variability. (See Alexander 2002 Statistical
analysis of extreme floods.) Claims have been made that the world-wide increase in the
loss of life and damage by floods is the result of global warming. This is not so. The
increases in loss of life and possessions are the result of increases in the
vulnerability, as population growth forces disadvantaged communities to occupy
flood-prone areas.
18.13.Global warming will not threaten water resource management
As a consequence mainly of anticipated changes in precipitation, the UKTR95
scenario for 2050 shows decreases in annual runoff of the order 0-40% over
much of South Africa. From a perspective of water resources management
however, equally significant changes to those of mean annual runoff are
increases of 10-20% in the interannual CV of runoff. These increases could add
to the cost and complexity of managing water resources by requiring increased
storage capacities as well as more stringent reservoir operating rules in regard to
releases in dry years. (Schulze, Meigh and Horan 2001.)
The certainty of prolonged and intense water restrictions. (DEAT 15 December
2004.)

The paper by Schulze, Meigh and Horan: Present and potential future vulnerability of
eastern and southern Africa’s hydrology and water resources (2001), is an excellent
example of untested hypotheses based on questionable GCMs. It confirms the unanimous
views of the world’s leading scientists in water resource analyses with whom I have
discussed the issue, that climate change scenarios are no more than untested hypotheses
that have no place in water resources development and management.
In southern Africa in general, and South Africa in particular, we have a wealth of
routinely observed hydometeorological data. Many rainfall records exceed 100 years in
length and many river flow records exceed 80 years in length. Yet this wealth of data was

71

totally ignored by these authors who rely solely on the outputs of global climate models
and simplistic rainfall and runoff model assumptions for their analyses.
In the abstract of their paper it is stated that:
This paper presents a synthesis of water as a vulnerable resource in space and
time under present climatic conditions by assessing various rainfall, evaporation
and runoff indices in the region. Further, uncertainties regarding this already
high-risk natural environment are compounded by superimposing elements of
potential climate change for the year 2050 scenario over the region.

The following are some of the views that are expressed in the paper that are far removed
from reality.
Figure 3d in the paper shows an increase in annual potential evaporation for the 2050
scenario for the whole of Botwana, Namibia and eastern Zimbabwe i.e. the area covered
by the Kalahari sands, of between 4% and 8%. The GCMs used by Thomas et al (2005)
discussed earlier, predicted increases of between 200% and 400% for the same region.
These order of magnitude differences in GCM outputs illustrate the fundamental
shortcomings of global climate models. In both cases, it would have been a simple
exercise to determine historical trends based on real world data, and extrapolate them into
the future.
The coefficient of variation (CV) is quoted several times in the paper to descibe
variability in the context of water resources. ‘The inter-annual variability of
precipitation, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV,%) is an important
consideration in water resource planning’. This is an unacceptably simplistic
characterisation of the statistical properties of rainfall and river flow. They have no place
in water resource planning. These properties are addressed in Part 3 of this report and in
the hydrological literature.
In Fig. 4 (c) of their paper, they map the drought risk index as the ratio of the tenth
percent to the fiftieth percent of the annual runoff. However, no relationship exists
between drought risk and annual runoff, as the most important property of a drought is its
duration.
In their Fig. 4 (d) they map a flood severity index as the ratio of the 50-year: 2-year, 1day runoff. It is well known that the flood-producing runoff per unit area of a catchment
decreases with increase in catchment area. The ratio between the 50-year and 2-year, 1day unit runoff will vary along the length of a river and is not a regional characteristic.
(See Alexander 2002, Statistical analysis of extreme floods.)
A reduction in rainfall is predicted for the whole of South Africa by 2050. This is
contrary to the IPCC scenarios as well as my observation of an increase in rainfall during
the past 78 years. Rainfall will continue to increase as long as global warming increases,
whatever the cause. This is another example of questionable GCM outputs that were not
calibrated or verified by comparison with real world observed data.
The resulting decrease in river flow by 2050 is equally questionable.

72

As a consequence mainly of anticipated changes in precipitation, the UKTR95
scenario for 2050 shows decreases in annual runoff of the order 0-40% over
much of South Africa.

This is a dramatic prediction with far reaching consequences. There are no observational
grounds to support these simplistic and alarmist claims that are based solely on GCM
predictions and questionable rainfall-runoff models.
The authors do not reference a single publication on hydrology or water resource
development in South Africa, other than to publications from their own organisation. This
is despite the numerous publications on this subject during the past 50 years right up to
the present day. (For example Alexander 1985 Hydrology of low latitude southern
hemisphere land masses and Management of the water resources of the Republic of
South Africa issued by DWAF in 1986.)
No water resource practitioner would even remotely consider designing or operating
water resource development projects based on GCM scenarios applied to simplistic
rainfall-runoff model assumptions. This is particularly in the light of the availability of a
wealth of routinely recorded data, and sound analytical methods based on advanced time
series analyses, and not on primitive coefficients of variation.
18.14.Global warming will not increase poverty
In short, climate change will intensify the worst effects of poverty through losses
in biodiversity, agriculture, health and almost every sector of society. (DEAT 5
May 2005.)

The inclusion of ‘poverty’ is a typical alarmist tactic. Poverty is unrelated to these factors.
On the contrary, it is the recommended action to counter the unavoidable and continued
increases in greenhouse gas emissions that will increase poverty, malnutrition and
disease.
18.15.Global warming will not increase extreme events
Evidence exists to suggest that variability and extremes in the southern parts of
southern Africa may be increasing especially in the drier, western parts. Between
1931 and 1990, the intensity of extreme events has increased significantly over
South Africa. (Tyson and Gatebe 2001.)

It has been stated that signs of adverse climate changes have already been observed in
South Africa. I have not found any adverse changes in the hydrometeorological processes
other than those described in this report. Nor have I seen any examples of postulated
changes that have been subjected to rigorous analyses. Climate, as well as the natural
environment that responds to it, are in a continuous state of flux on all time and space
scales. As I have described in this report, it is a major and time-consuming exercise to
distinguish between natural variability and variability that is the consequence of human
activities. If undesirable changes are assumed to be present, then the question remains
whether or not they are of sufficient magnitude to require incorporation in practical
applications where most other components have uncertainties of the same order. There is
no believable evidence of a meaningful increase in extreme events in South Africa.

73

19. The remedies?
South Africa’s report A national climate change response strategy for South Africa was
submitted to the UN Conference of the Parties who signed the Kyoto protocol at Buenos
Aires in December 2004. The following comments are on postulated actions required to
reduce the impact of global warming that were proposed in the report. Regrettably they
reflect a lack of knowledge on these issues.
19.1.Replacement of coal-fired power stations
The use of lower grade coal for power generation was criticised because of postulated
greater emissions of dangerous greenhouse gasses. Visualise the following laboratory
experiment. Burn a measured amount of pure carbon in a flask. The two products will be
heat energy and CO2. Now add some sand to the same amount of carbon and repeat the
experiment. Exactly the same amount of CO2 and heat energy will be produced. The inert
sand will be a by-product. There will not be any increase at all in CO2. Technology exists
to trap any other noxious gasses that may be produced.
To suggest that South Africa should cease using lower grade coal because this contributes
to global warming, demonstrates the researchers’ lack of understanding, irresponsibility
and careless disregard of the consequences to South Africa’s economy. The costs
involved in converting to other sources of energy can be far better used to fight
poverty, malnutrition and disease.
19.2.Better water resource management
This statement is offensive coming from those who have little experience in this subject.
Refer to the comprehensive and well-illustrated book Management of the water
resources of the Republic of South Africa, published by the Department of Water
Affairs in 1986 and earlier sections of this report.
19.3.Disaster management
It is the increased exposure to the consequences of natural phenomena that results in high
loss of life and damage to property. This was tragically illustrated by the tsunami disaster
in Indonesia and adjacent countries. There is no evidence to support the view that climate
change will increase the frequency and magnitude of natural disasters. It is the
vulnerability to these disasters that is increasing, not the magnitudes of the events
themselves. I discuss this in detail in my report commissioned by the United Nations
IDNDR secretariat titled Risk and society - an African perspective, (Alexander 1999).
19.4.Agricultural diversification
It is stated that South Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change because a large
portion of the country’s agricultural production consists of maize farming. The document
proposes that South African maize farmers should consider changing to other crops as
long duration droughts will occur during the next three decades which will make maize
farming unprofitable.

74

Maize is the staple food for tens of millions of people on the African continent. The
statement that South African maize farmers should consider changing to other crops, as
long duration droughts will occur during the next three decades, which will make maize
farming unprofitable, is both false and highly irresponsible.
19.5.More energy efficient transport
Reduction in fuel consumption has long been a target of vehicle manufacturers. This will
increase the cost of transport, particularly to the poorer communities who live far from
their places of employment.
19.6.More energy efficient housing models
This is an absurd suggestion for South African conditions where the majority of the
population live in sub-standard housing.
19.7.Technology transfer
The transfer of technology and skills from the developed to the developing nations was
recommended. I have been closely involved in technology transfer for most of my career.
There have been many well-meaning but misguided recommendations based on the
transfer of mild northern hemisphere technology to the semiarid and arid climatic
conditions of Africa. This technical report is a good example of material that is new to
science that comes from a developing nation. South African scientists in this field have
made the mistake of blindly following northern hemisphere science and assuming that it
is relevant to South African conditions without carrying out their own evaluations.
20. Conclusions to Part 2
This is an extremely serious situation. Alarmist claims are being made that are without
foundation. If these alarmist views are correct, then South Africa will be in a very serious
position in the years ahead, and we will almost certainly be heading into a recession with
all that this implies for the prosperity of our nation. Why has no South African authority
deemed it necessary to appoint an independent commission of enquiry on such a grave
issue instead of relying on the self-serving views of a small group of inexperienced
natural scientists?
20.1.Recommendations
Even if by some miracle Eskom closed down all its power stations, and all road and air
transport was banned, this will not have the slightest effect on South Africa’s climate now
or in the future.
In view of the very high cost of proposed prevention measures and the possible
adverse effects on the national economy, I strongly recommend that the Government
should place everything on hold. An independent commission of enquiry should be
appointed that includes representatives of all sectors of society that are likely to be
affected by global warming and proposed control measures.

75

76

PART 3: EVALUATION, ADAPTATION AND
PREDICTION
Major parts of the climate system respond slowly to changes in greenhouse gas
concentrations. Even if greenhouse gas emissions were stabilised instantly at
today’s levels, the climate would still continue to change as it adapts to the
increased emission of recent decades. Further changes in climate are therefore
unavoidable. Nations must prepare for them. (My emphasis.)

From the joint statement issued by eleven national academies of science: Global response
to climate change. June 2005.

21. Summary of Part 3
The problem that now confronts climate change scientists is that advanced data
analyses do not support their theories.
The IPCC should have sought expert advice on numerical analyses based on
observation theory, before issuing unfounded statements that have caused a great
deal of alarm to people and the nations of the world, divided scientists, and
produced scepticism in the eyes of experts in the affected fields.
The consequence, as shown in this report, is that South African climate change
scientists do not possess the skills required for evaluation, adaptation and prediction
studies. They will no doubt continue to deride all those who hold opposing views,
and will deliberately obstruct efforts directed towards finding workable solutions to
this very difficult problem. The people of South Africa will suffer as a result of this
unpatriotic policy.
22. Introduction to Part 3
A full set of data used in the analyses as well as the analyses themselves will be available
for study in the archives of the Department of Civil and Biosystems Engineering of the
University of Pretoria after the completion of the full report.
The analytical methods for evaluation, adaptation and prediction of the consequences of
global warming, from whatever cause, are summarised below. Details will be provided in
the full report.
A fundamental weakness of studies of the consequences of global warming on climate, is
the inability to quantify the changes in numerical terms that others can use to evaluate the
effects on the principal concerns of water resources, agriculture and the natural
environment, and through these, the financial consequences and the effects on national
economic welfare. It is this inability that is the direct cause of rising reluctance of
international decision-makers to introduce costly measures in the absence of any
assurance that the financial stringency will produce the desired results.

77

23. General information
There have been major changes in a whole climate change issue since I started preparing
this summary report in April 2005. I have had to spend a lot of time in keeping abreast of
the fast changing international developments. Nevertheless, this has been a good exercise
and has led to the production of this summary report where the principles are established
for the first time in South Africa and possibly elsewhere as well. They are in full
accordance with the latest international developments.
23.1.Change in emphasis
It is now universally acknowledged that whatever the causes of the observed global
warming, the proposed measures to contain or reverse it will only have a limited effect at
most, within the foreseeable future. The emphasis has now moved from prevention to
adaptation.
Adaptation can take a number of forms. The creation of nature reserves to protect rare
species is an example. This report is devoted to those methods that require a numerical
understanding of the processes. It is the first publication in South Africa that deals
directly with numerical methods required for adaptation to future trends, or other
abnormalities associated with climate change, whatever the cause.
23.2.Differences of approach
Nowhere in the world are the designs of water supply systems or structures exposed to
flood damage based on process theory. Without exception, they are based on the analysis
of the wealth of data published by the responsible national authorities. Many recorded
data series are now approaching 100 years in length.
In contrast, there is a growing group of scientists in the soft sciences (sciences that do not
rely on recorded data for their studies) that place the emphasis on process theory. Ideally,
the combination of both process theory and observational theory should be applied to the
solution of climate-related problems. However, the very opposite is happening. The rift
between the applications of process and observational theories to climate-related
problems is growing, not closing. This is illustrated by the refusal of the organisers of the
recent national conference on climate change to invite those with opposing views to
address the conference.
The problem that now confronts those climate change scientists who rely on process
theory, is that advanced data analyses do not support their theories. This is illustrated
repeatedly in this report. Instead of acknowledging this and working towards a solution,
they appear to be involved in a fruitless search for data and that supports the theory,
instead of acknowledging the results of the data analyses and working towards the cause.
Lord Kelvin made this mistake more than a hundred years ago and modern climate
change scientists are repeating it.

78

23.3.Approach used in these studies
The approach adopted in this report, is the well-tried approach used in civil engineering
practice for more than half a century. The procedure consists of four consecutive steps.
The first step is the assembly of the database required for the analyses. This consists of
individual data sets recorded at each site or district. Each set is a time series of annual
values.
The second step is the quantification of the properties of the principal variables in each
time series.
The third step is the determination of whether or not long-term (i.e. multi-year) trends
and other properties are discernible concurrently in all or most individual time series, and
in all or most processes.
The fourth step is the identification of the most likely causes of the long-term trends
should they be present. This is not an essential step in the analyses.
The fifth step is the development of analytical methods to accommodate these
abnormalities in practical applications.
The results presented in this report are based on a diligent study of many thousands of
years of data published by the responsible South African authorities. This is the most
comprehensive study of climate-related data ever undertaken in South Africa and
probably elsewhere in the world. The results have been published in peer-reviewed
papers, one in South Africa and the other in the UK, (Alexander 2005a and 2005b). Some
of the findings are the first reported in the scientific literature anywhere. Why do climate
change scientists find it so difficult to acknowledge these findings?
24. Data requirements for climate variability analyses
The data must be publicly available data from the official state authorities responsible for
its collection and publication, namely the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry
(DWAF), and the South African Weather Service (SAWS). Large volumes of data are
available from these two sources and there is no justification for retrieving data from
other, less reliable and less representative sources.
24.1.Variables of interest
The principal variables of interest in numerical analyses are rainfall, river flow, open
water surface evaporation and flood peak maxima.
Temperature is a measure and not a process. It has to be attached to variables such as air
temperature at a specified altitude and site, or ground temperature generated by direct
solar radiation. The postulated linkages between annual average air temperatures
and environmental responses are highly suspect.
While annual average temperatures may be of interest in Antarctica they are of no
practical significance in continental South Africa. Temperature does not feature in water
resource or flood analyses.

79

24.2.Time scale
The universally used time scale is the annual values. In many applications the
hydrological years starting on 1st October are used, not calendar years. It can be shown
that starting months other than October provide a more efficient division into annual
values but these vary geographically and are not used in practice.
In situations where the analyses require shorter duration periods, the standard practice is
to disaggregate annual values into seasonal or monthly values. Direct analyses of
monthly or seasonal values has no practical significance, as the values in the immediately
preceding or succeeding months will have a large effect on the consequences of
deviations from average values.
24.3.Space scale
The appropriate space scale will depend on the application. As the interest is in the effects
of climate variability, it would be incorrect to study point rainfall records for example.
The interest is in rainfall over an area, not at a point on the ground. It was for this reason
that the SAWS established and maintained its district rainfall database. This has been
successfully used in practice ever since its establishment more than 30 years ago. While
point rainfalls may vary over a wide range within a rainfall district, this increases the
validity of using a single district rainfall value rather than multiple point rainfall values.
River flow and flood peak maxima are areal properties that are related to the size of the
catchment.
Unlike rainfall, evaporation varies only slowly with geography. No areal values are
available.
24.4.Data must not be manipulated
It is very important that other than patching minor gaps in the records, the data must not
be manipulated by smoothing or by any other techniques either before or during the
analyses. The reason is that such smoothing will mask important sudden changes. The
compilation of data into artificial data grids for GCM analyses is both unnecessary and
suspect. This is because the grids are artificial features that do not relate to regional
climate or topography.
24.5.Database
The database used in the analyses in computer-readable format will be included in the
final report.
25. Hydrometeorological processes
The soil-moisture deficit has to be satisfied before runoff can occur. This is a function of
evaporation losses between rainfall events. River flow and floods are therefore a function
of both rainfall and antecedent evaporation.
The following table is from my 1985 contribution Hydrology of low latitude Southern
Hemisphere landmasses. (Alexander 1985). It shows how the principal variables change

80

with aridity and combine to produce river flow that decreases exponentially with increase
in aridity. This illustrates the dangers of applying mild climate hydrology to the situation
in South Africa.

My subsequent analyses showed that both rainfall and evaporation increased during the
period of record. It is the difference between the two that is important for predicting the
effects of climate change on river flow. This is illustrated in Fig. 16.

81

Figure 16. Relationship between mean monthly potential evaporation (unshaded), rainfall (vertical
shading), and river flow (solid shading) at four representative dam catchments. The values in the
vertical axes are millimetres.

This information illustrates the danger of making generalisations regarding the
relationships between these processes within the context of climate change. The average
monthly relationships between the three processes: evaporation, rainfall and river flow,
are substantially different at the four sites.
Steenbras Dam is located in the winter rainfall region of South Africa. Evaporation and
rainfall are out of phase. This has a particular hydrological advantage, in that catchment
losses due to direct evaporation from the soil and vegetation during the period of
maximum rainfall are low, and consequently the percentage of the rainfall that
contributes to river flow is high.
Woodstock Dam is located at the foot of the Drakensberg with a relief of 1500 m in its
basin. The catchment rainfall is much higher than at Steenbras Dam, but it is synchronous
with potential evaporation. However, cloud cover associated with the high rainfall,
suppresses the evaporation losses to some extent.

82

At Vaal Dam the relationships between rainfall, potential evaporation and river flow are
typical of those of the sub-continental interior.
Rooiberg Dam is located in a semi-desert region. Evaporation losses are very high, and
only 2,7% of the already low rainfall is converted into river flow. For South Africa as a
whole only about 8,5% of the rainfall is returned to the oceans under natural conditions,
(i.e. ignoring upstream abstractions).
These differences illustrate the danger of generalisations relating to climate change such
as statements that an increase of X% in evaporation will result in a decrease of Y% in
water supplies. Also, no two dam basins have the same ratio of surface area to stored
volume. A dam in a river with a flat gradient will have a large surface area and much
larger exposure to evaporation losses than a dam on a steep river in a narrow valley.
26. Trend analyses
Graphical analyses are often treated with disdain by theoreticians. However, the
properties of recorded data must be determined before they can be described
mathematically. Graphical analyses provide insights that are not detectable by
mathematical analysis. Failure to appreciate this led to the inability to detect the
unambiguous increase in rainfall over South Africa during the period of record.
In graphical analyses, each observation is separated into two components, the record
mean (the signal), and the departures from the record mean (the noise). If it is observed
on the graph that the variability about the mean is not purely random but exhibits a
regular pattern, then the non-random component has to be identified, quantified, removed
from the noise component and added to the signal component. This provides an estimate
of the true mean, its behaviour, and the randomness of the noise component. Only then
can mathematical procedures be used to describe the properties of the data.
The procedure is very simple, and does not involve any manipulation of the data such as
the use of filters or smoothing. Nor does it involve any mathematical theory, other than
standard serial correlation analyses. The procedure is as follows.
Given a set of annual sequences, calculate the record mean and subtract this value from
each of the observations. Some of the results will be negative. Divide each of these
differences by the mean. Start with zero, add the differences one at a time, and plot the
accumulated sums. The last accumulated value will be zero. The result is a graph of the
accumulated departure from the record mean. The pattern of the plot on the graph is then
interpreted.
The next exercise is the determination of the degree of dependence of one observation on
the previous observations. The serial correlation coefficient is a measure of the
correlation between observations a range of distances apart (lags). Given N observations
x1, … xN, (N-1) pairs of observations, (x1, x2), (x2, x3), …., (xN-1, xN) can be developed.
The correlation coefficient between xt and xt+1 is then determined using standard
correlation analyses. The procedure is repeated for lags of 2, 3, … observations apart.
These are then plotted on a graph called a correlogram, in which rk is plotted against lag

83

k. The statistical confidence band is also determined using standard procedures, and
shown on the graph.
If any cyclical or oscillatory behaviour exists in the data, this will be evident in the form
of cyclicity in the correlogram. I did not find this in any of the annual data sets. The
correlogram is a very useful tool for detecting anomalous behaviour of the mean itself.
The correlogram is a much more useful tool for searching for linkages between
atmospheric processes and the hydrometeorological responses, than spectral analysis
methods, which do no more than disaggregate the data into a series of pseudo-cycles.
27. Environmental prediction modelling
The processes in the natural environment are highly complex and there has been a
tendency towards simplistic conclusions that are unsupportable by numerical, statistical
or logical deductions.
There are two possible numerical approaches to environmental prediction modelling. The
first is the analysis of the past and project it into the future. This is the approach that I
have followed for the past three years. I found a general increase in the rainfall over
South Africa that nobody else has reported. I could not find any support for any of the
other climate change claims.
The other approach is the development of deterministic (cause-effect) models. While
conceptually very attractive, they are not in general use in South Africa despite half a
century of research. There are solid theoretical reasons for this inability. They include the
well-known problems of dimensionality in particular, as well as those of uncertainty and
scale. These problems are not accommodated in the GCMs.
28. Advanced water resource analyses
There is an urgent need for a more refined characterisation of the annual flows in South
African rivers. This is required for water resource planning and operation procedures, as
well as for the determination of in-stream environmental requirements, particularly
during drought periods.
A further requirement is the development of a method for the prediction of the likelihood
of the onset, magnitude, and duration of severe droughts that will necessitate the
imposition of water restrictions on a regional scale. This ability will also be of use when
planning the appropriate time for the implementation of new water resource development
projects.
The situation is now becoming critical as South Africa's water resources rapidly approach
the limit of exploitation.
Anomalies in hydrological data series have long been known and have been the subject of
a great deal of research, particularly during the period 1950 to 1980. Although
sophisticated methods have been developed and are available, the tendency in civil
engineering practice in water resource development is towards the use of simple,
conservative, well calibrated empirical methods, (Alexander 2000). Conservatism is

84

therefore built into design practice. Climate change scenarios postulating increases in the
magnitude of these processes are of little practical interest. They are generally regarded
as no more than untested hypotheses.
28.1.Time series analyses
In water resource applications, the point of departure is the knowledge that the historical
record will not be repeated during the design life of the project. The emphasis is therefore
on the development of models that will produce equally likely sequences of annual river
flows. These are then disaggregated into monthly values. A number of sequences are
generated sequentially and subjectively interpreted depending on the application.
The requirements are not only accuracy but also robustness, consistency, and ease of
application.
There are four levels of assurance in time series analyses:
1. Property not present.
2. Property not detectable when using a specific method or methods.
3. Property present and operationally meaningful but has not yet reached a high level
of statistical significance.
4. Property present and statistically significant at an appropriate level.
It is tempting to carry out level 4 analyses and if the property is not statistically
significant, to proclaim that it is not present. This is not correct. There is a world of
difference between ‘statistically significant’ and ‘operationally meaningful’.
The development of a suitable model for the dual purpose of identifying and then
accommodating important, but difficult to quantify signals in hydrological data series,
requires some philosophical adjustments to current analytical procedures.
The obvious analytical sequence is to quantify the processes and then to determine the
causes of any observed abnormalities but only if this is required. It is equally obvious that
the procedure cannot be used reliably in reverse. Unfortunately this has become common
practice in climatological analyses. A good example is the erroneous interpretation of the
results of spectral analyses of rainfall data, e.g. Tyson (1987). This has seriously
hampered climatological research. There are other examples where anomalies in the data
series have been identified and have been erroneously assumed to be the consequence of
climate change without any supporting hydrological or meteorological evidence.
The family of models most used by climatologists and others in the natural sciences is the
spectral analysis models. Like all probability distributions it is a curve-fitting procedure.
These analyse the whole data spectrum and do not separate the mean from the variability
about the mean. Consequently, the variability has to be reduced (smoothed) by using
binomial or other filters. This is undesirable for two reasons. It is precisely this year-toyear variability that is of major climatological interest. Secondly the compound
oscillatory behaviour assumed in the method has led to the erroneous assumption that it is
present in the data. Another objection is that this method cannot be used with confidence

85

for the generation of synthetic sequences required for water resource analyses. Spectral
analysis methods do not feature in modern civil engineering procedures.
Graphs and tables are inherently more sensitive tools for identifying signals in data series
than mathematical equations or computer models. The numerical quantification of the
processes should be the last step in the analytical procedure, not the first. Because of this,
non-numerical descriptors have to be used to describe the strengths of conviction of the
analyst. The descriptions used in this presentation are visually discernible, operationally
meaningful, and statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Those who maintain
that the first two levels are subjective assessment and are therefore undesirable, should
appreciate that without them the identification of the effect of climate change on the
hydrological and meteorological processes will become virtually impossible.
Another very important philosophical issue is best illustrated by the following simple
example. It is obvious that rainfall is the direct result of atmospheric processes. It is
equally obvious that changes in the atmospheric processes cannot be reliably inferred
from changes in the rainfall at a single site. However, if the same change is present in an
increasing number of sites over an increasingly wide area, then logically the strength of
conviction must increase accordingly.
28.2.Analytical methodology
The analytical methodology described in this report is a radical departure from that
currently in use in South Africa and elsewhere. It is nevertheless soundly based on the
analysis of the largest and most comprehensive hydrometeorological database yet
assembled in South Africa. The methodology is simple and requires no mathematical or
statistical expertise to understand and apply it.
29. Water resource modelling
29.1.Characterisation river flow sequences
Hurst (1951), analysed 1080 years of data from the Rodda Nilometer in the Nile River
recorded during the period 641 AD to 1946 AD, which he used to determine the required
storage capacity of the proposed new Aswan High Dam. He found an unexplained
anomaly in the data. He then analysed other long geophysical records, where he found the
same anomaly. These were sediment deposits in lakes (2000 years), river flow (1080
years), tree rings (900 years), temperature (175 years), rainfall (121 years), sunspots and
wheat prices. This anomaly became known as the Hurst phenomenon, or Hurst’s Ghost.
Salas et al (1977) noted that the interpretation of the Hurst phenomenon has been a
controversial subject in statistical hydrology ever since Hurst published his first results.
They reviewed the literature on this subject, and concluded that the Hurst phenomenon is
demonstrably not the result of a simple unique property, but should rather be
interpreted as a transient phenomenon with independent time series, which can be
accentuated by a mixture of effects including autocorrelation, non-stationarity and
non-normality. [Climate change scientists please note!]

86

The analyses of a large hydrometeorological database described in this report confirmed
this conclusion by Salas et al, but went one step further, in that I identified and quantified
the autocorrelation and non-stationarity. The study also confirmed the non-normality in
the data. In addition, the study showed an important and previously unreported
characteristic of South African river flow time series. This is the statistically significant,
predictable, sudden reversals, from sequences of low rainfall and river flow to sequences
of high rainfall and floods. These could well be the missing links in the Hurst
phenomenon.
The Gaussian models described in the hydrological literature during the past 30 years are
inherently incapable of modelling this multidecadal periodicity with its characteristic
reversals, asymmetry and instability. A non-stationary statistical model that was capable
of replicating the multidecadal properties had to be sought. The model had to be capable
of being used to assess the possible effects of climate change scenarios on water resource
development and management. This would be via the generation of long, multidecadal
synthetic sequences of rainfall and river flow using Monte Carlo procedures.
29.2.Development of the analytical model
The development of the model was an important departure from current statistical models
such as those described by Pegram & McKenzie (1991), and Basson et al (1994). In these
models the record mean is used with serial dependence limited to one or two years. All
other abnormalities that may be present were assumed to be noise components and were
modelled as such.
In the graphical analyses presented in this report, each observation was separated into two
components, the record mean (the signal), and the departures from the record mean (the
noise). If it was observed on the graphs that the variability about the mean was not purely
random (white noise), but exhibited a regular pattern, then the non-random component
was identified, quantified, removed from the noise component and added to the signal
component. This provided an estimate of the true mean, its behaviour, and the
randomness of the noise component. Only then were mathematical procedures used to
describe the properties of the data. A model was developed that re-combined the varying
mean with the variability about the varying mean.
29.3.Marginal distribution
The next step was the selection of the most suitable marginal distribution to describe the
observed properties. All marginal distributions are curve-fitting procedures, in that a
model is sought that best describes the properties of the hydrological records. The
selection of the most appropriate distribution may be based on mathematical procedures,
or by visual examination of the plotted data.
Hipel (1985) made the pragmatic observation that natural processes are inherently nonstationary, and therefore the greater the time span of the historical series, the greater the
probability that the series will exhibit characteristics which change with time. This was

87

confirmed by Alexander (2002), based on the statistical analyses of annual flood peak
maxima at 152 representative sites totalling 6 728 years of record.
The difficulty in finding an appropriate distribution lies with the fact that observations are
the consequence of a number of dependent and independent, chance-related, hydrological
and climatological processes, with the result that the data are not identically distributed,
but may be sufficiently so for most practical applications.
The selection criterion used in this report, was that the distribution had to be one that is
widely used in current hydrological analyses. Alexander (2002), reduced the number of
distributions that qualified for this requirement to the log Pearson Type 3 distribution
using conventional moment estimators (LP3/MM), which is widely used in South Africa
and internationally, followed by the generalised extreme value distribution using
probability weighted moments, (GEV/PWM), and the recently developed generalised
logistic distribution using L-moments (GL/LM), as a poor third.
The second requirement was that the distribution had to be capable of being used
successfully for the generation of multidecadal synthetic sequences. This requires the
ability to introduce long-term periodicity with its characteristic reversals and asymmetry
in the distribution parameters, as well as the recovery of these values from the synthetic
data sets. This ruled out the LP3/MM distribution and left the GEV/PWM distribution,
which proved to be ideal for the purpose. Its structure is simple and its application does
not require an advanced knowledge that is beyond that of most practitioners. Details of
the distribution and its synthetic data generation algorithms are provided in Alexander
(2000), and expanded in the main report.
29.4.Accommodating periodicity
Hutchins (1889) reported the presence of 11-year periodicity in South African rainfall and
its linkage with the sunspot cycle. He noted that the annual rainfall rose steeply to a
maximum and then fell gradually to a minimum. He also made several references to
occasions when ‘great floods ended a period of drought’. In 1971 and subsequently,
Tyson & Dyer (1978) and others published a number of papers in which they
demonstrated the presence of an 18-year cyclicity in South African rainfall, based on
spectral analyses. Alexander (1978) demonstrated the presence of 20-year (now 21-year)
periodicity in South African river flow, and its linkage with the double sunspot cycle
based on graphical analyses. Subsequent statistical analyses confirmed these conclusions.
There can be no doubt about the presence of this periodicity in the rainfall and river flow
records, and its linkage with solar activity. The signal is very clear, and if concurrent
periodicity in climatological processes can be found, this could be an important step in
linking the climatological processes and the hydrometeorological responses. No efforts in
this direction appear to have been made by climate change scientists.
29.5.Measures of serial dependence
The dependence of a measurement in one year on that in the previous year, can be
disaggregated into three components – an autoregressive (AR) component and a moving

88

average (MA) component, which together are described as the deterministic component,
and the third component, which is the unexplained residual component. This should be a
pure random component, often described as ‘white noise’. Over the years these ARMA
models have been used extensively in South Africa, (Basson et al, 1994 and Pegram and
McKenzie 1991) and internationally, Yevjevich (1972). The general conclusion based on
the application of these models, is that such serial dependence that may exist in South
African data, does not extend beyond one year, and that the moving average component
and periodicity can be safely ignored in hydrological analyses. This is the basis for
assuming that long term periodicity is not relevant in hydrological analyses.
However, there is a serious flaw in this approach. The family of ARMA models is based
on the Gaussian distribution, the reason being that linear operations on the Gaussian
variates preserve Gaussianity. This proved to be satisfactory, and as a result, the
theoretical research on the development of stochastic models that can explicitly handle
variables that are non-Gaussian has only been initiated recently, (Lewis 1985). A nonGaussian model was developed for the present study. It can accommodate multidecadal
periodicity in climatological and hydrological processes. The following are the principal
equations.

ARMA models retain Gaussian properties, i.e. the two parameters (mean

, and standard

deviation s ) can be recovered from the synthetic data set. However, this is not possible if
periodicity is introduced in either the mean or the standard deviation, and a non-Gaussian
model has to be used. The generalized extreme value distribution was selected for this
purpose.

89

where et is GEV distributed,

where U is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, and k, α and µ are
the GEV distribution parameters.
Periodicity can be introduced by multiplying the mean

by a random component

which is a function of the period, amplitude, and form of the periodicity which need not
be cyclical. All the distribution parameters can be recovered from the synthetic data sets.
This confirms the validity of the model. Details are provided in the full report.
30. Conclusions to Part 3
A generalized extreme value distribution was developed that can be used to simulate the
multidecadal properties of rainfall and river flow. The simulation procedures can be used
to refine the reservoir storage-yield relationship, as well as to model possible effects of
climate change scenarios on water resource development and management.
Climate change scenarios that postulate increases in the severity of both floods and
droughts pose a conundrum. Widespread floods caused rivers to flow strongly; dams are
filled; soils become saturated and vegetation flourishes. Droughts cause rivers to dry up;
dams are emptied; soils dry out and vegetation wilts. How then is it possible for the
frequency of both floods and droughts to increase, as one negates the effect of the other?
There are other aspects of climate change scenarios that predict changes in hydrological
processes that generate scepticism in the eyes of practitioners. Anomalies in the data that
are well known to hydrologists are now being discovered and attributed to climate
change.
How can climate change scientists characterise variability about the mean condition
without characterising the behaviour of the mean itself? An equally important question is
how will global warming affect the statistically significant periodic behaviour described
in this report? It is the high rainfall events that by their presence or absence introduced
the statistical significance in the periodicity of the data.
The IPCC should have sought expert advice before issuing unfounded statements
that have caused a great deal of alarm to people and the nations of the world,
divided scientists, and produced scepticism in the eyes of experts in the affected
fields.
