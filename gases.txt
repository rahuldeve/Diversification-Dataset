Greenhouse Gases
Description of the
Activity

Reason for Doing
the Activity

Students observe and contrast thermal properties of three major greenhouse
gases. Using simple, readily available materials, students collect temperature
change over time for dry air, water saturated air, carbon dioxide, and methane.
Climate change is a major global issue of our time. Understanding the essential
principles of climate science will enable students to better assess information and
to contribute to what will be ongoing climate discussions as informed citizens.
Climate literacy is supported by all the science education standard initiatives
including the earlier National Science Education Standards (NSES), the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Benchmarks for Science
Literacy, and more recent educational guideline documents such as the U.S.
Global Change Research Program’s Climate Literacy Essential Principles and the
College Board’s Science Standard’s for College Success.

The amount of solar energy absorbed or radiated
by Earth is modulated by the atmosphere and depends
on its composition. Greenhouse gases—such as water
vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane—occur naturally
in small amounts and absorb and release heat energy
more efficiently than abundant atmospheric gases like
nitrogen and oxygen. Small increases in carbon
dioxide concentration have a large effect on the
climate system.

ESM-PE.2.1.2 Make a claim, using representations and
models of incoming solar radiation (insolation) and
the greenhouse effect, how changes in the
atmosphere (i.e., atmospheric composition, cloud
coverage) and in Earth’s surface (i.e., glacial
coverage) will affect the energy budget. ESMPE.2.1.2a Identify major greenhouse gases (e.g.,
water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone) and
their natural and anthropogenic sources. Interpret the
long-term annual flux of the Keeling Curve.

However, in so many science education standards documents, textbooks and
curriculum guides alike, greenhouse gases are merely identified – facts to be taken
at face value – with little or no opportunity presented as to how their thermal
properties might be explored, measured and contrasted. Although there are many
complex and dynamic interactions between greenhouse gases and with all other
components of Earth’s climate system, this activity provides an opportunity for
students to ask questions, take measurements, make observations, and interpret
findings.

Background

Earth’s atmospheric gases are often divided up into constant and variable
components. The major constant gas components remain the same over time and
location are:
Nitrogen (N2)
Oxygen (O2)
Argon (Ar)

78%
21%
1%

The major variable gas components that vary over time and location are:
Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
Water Vapor (H20)
Methane (CH4)
Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
Ozone (O3)
Nitrogen oxides
(NO, NO2, N2O)

0.038%
0-4%

While nitrogen and oxygen comprise 99% of the atmospheric gases, they have
little effect on atmospheric processes and consequently little to no effect on
weather or climate. The gases which make up far less than 1 percent of the
atmosphere have a much greater influence on both short-term weather and longterm climate. The less abundant gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, and sulfur dioxide all have an important property. These gases have
the ability to absorb thermal energy (heat) emitted by the earth and thus are able to
warm the atmosphere. This warming is what is popularly called the "greenhouse
effect." There are obvious benefits to these so-called greenhouse gases as without
them the surface of the earth would be about 30 degrees Celsius cooler, and far
too cold for life, as we know it, to exist. On the other hand, these greenhouse
gases are so thermally potent that even proportionately small amounts can cause
Earth’s lower atmospheric temperature to rise.
Current concern about global climate change refers to the altering of temperature
and precipitation resulting from the anthropogenically induced accumulation of
greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, which include water vapor, carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), tropospheric ozone (O3) and
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are relatively transparent to incoming solar radiation
but they absorb outgoing infrared radiation emitted from Earth's surface.

Greenhouse
Effect

Most of the incoming solar radiation (short wavelength, shown in purple) is absorbed and
converted to long wavelength radiation (shown in red), at or near the Earth's surface.
Thermal energy (heat) results from the absorption of some long wavelength radiation by
atmospheric gases, including water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
nitrous oxide (N2O). The greenhouse effect is the retention of this heat in the atmosphere.
Some human activities increase the amount of greenhouse gases, primarily CO2.

What is it about
these gases that
allow them to
retain heat in the
atmosphere?

Long wave radiation emanating from Earth’s surface causes molecules of a
specific size and structure to vibrate. The greenhouse gases are of the right
molecular size and structure for this to occur. This vibration or resonance allows
the molecules of these gases to heat up.

Grade Level

Secondary School (depth of interpretation and analyses of results can be adjusted
accordingly.)

Materials

Clear plastic water bottles with hole drilled into cap (recommend one bottle for
every 3 students). The bottles should all be the same type, have clear plastic sides
(remove any labels), and all be approximately 20 ounces in size.
Thermometers (analogue, digital or digital recording; one for each bottle).
Vinegar
Baking Powder
Methane Gas (from laboratory gas jet)
Light source (clamp lamp or goose neck) and bulb (standard incandescent or
directed spot; one setup for each bottle).

1. Students should be divided up into four different groups (one for each bottle
and for each gas). So that all students can be engaged in data collection
and recording, it is best that no more than three students are in each group.
Each group of students will have one bottle in which one of the gases
(regular air, water saturated air, CO2 or CH4) will be placed. (For the
saturated air, carbon dioxide, and methane filled bottles see below.)
2. Record the starting “room” temperature by holding the bottle cap and
temperature probe in the air for 1 minute. Record this temperature. NOTE:
Do not just set the probe on a desk. If you do, you’ll be recording the desk
temperature. Also, don’t hold the tip of the probe because then you’ll be
taking your temperature.
3. Place one of the four gases (regular air, saturated air, carbon dioxide or
methane) into each of the designated bottles. (Be certain to follow directions
and safety procedures below).
4. Screw the cap on tightly by holding the cap and turning the bottle. (Although
in the reverse, counterclockwise direction, this is the way a good bottle of
champagne should be opened!)
5. Place all the bottles at a designated distance from the light source (we
recommend not less than a foot, and no more than a foot and one-half.)
6. Plug in the lamp and turn it on, and start collecting and recording
temperature on the data chart provided every minute for 15 minutes. After
15 minutes, turn the light off and continue recording the temperature for an
additional 10 minutes.
7. Plot the data you collected down in step 7 for temperature (Y) and time (X)
on the data graph provided.

Procedures

For the bottle with air: Just tighten the cap.
For the bottle with saturated air: Place a piece of saturated sponge in the bottom
of the bottle. Make certain it is large enough to cover at least half of the bottom of
the bottle.
For the bottle with carbon dioxide and for pouring the gas into the bottle:
Carbon dioxide can be easily made with baking soda and vinegar. Vinegar (acetic
acid) CH3COOH, and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) NaHCO3 produces an
acid-base reaction when they come in contact with one another. The fizzing and
bubbling indicates that a gas (CO2) is being produced. Chemically, the reaction is:
CH3COOH + NaHCO3 ---> CH3COONa + H2CO3
The H2CO3 (carbonic acid) quickly turns into carbon dioxide and water.
H2CO3 ---> H2O + CO2
(The CO2 is what you see in the foaming and bubbling in this reaction.)
Pour 30 ml (about 1 ounce) of vinegar into a plastic cup or beaker. Spoon in ½ tsp
of baking powder. Allow the reaction to bubble and fizz without disturbing it. When
the fizzing is over, carefully pour the CO2 into the bottle. [Adding more vinegar and
baking soda will just make the reaction bubble excessively, and the CO2 will tend to
bubble over the beaker and you won’t be able to get it into the bottle.] BE
CERTAIN NOT TO POUR ANY LIQUID INTO THE BOTTLE! Repeat this process
two more times. Put the cap on the bottle.

Note: CO2 gas is more dense than air. It will stay in the beaker, forcing out the air.
Although you can’t see it, you can pour CO2 gas out of the beaker just like you
would pour a liquid. By way of teacher demonstration, a match can be lit and
placed down into the gas. The match will be extinguished showing that the oxygen
in the air has now been forced out, replaced by the carbon dioxide. Students can
also feel the CO2 being poured out of the beaker because it’s cold (similar to cold
carbon dioxide gas coming out of a fire extinguisher). As the reaction with baking
soda and vinegar is “endothermic,” meaning that energy (as well as CO2) leaves
the products during the reaction cold, care should be taken not to introduce any of
the liquid into the bottle as it will continue to keep the temperature of the liquid
depressed.
For Methane: As methane is lighter than air, simply invert the bottle over a gas jet
in the lab and allow some gas to flow into the bottle for a few seconds. The gas jet
needs only to be turned on for a few seconds to replace the air and fill the bottle.
NOTE: as natural gas can be ignited by a flame, extreme care should be
taken to keep any lighted material away from the gas jet and bottle. Only the
teacher should fill the bottles with methane, and only the closed bottle
should be given to the student.
Analyses and
Questions (for
students)

A Few Points to
Keep in Mind

1.

Describe the general trend in temperature over time that was observed. For
example, did the temperature of the gas show a consistent increase, did it
show a rapid rise and then level off, or did it reach a peak temperature
above which it rose no further? After the light was turned off, how did the
trend in temperature drop compare to its rise? (Explain)

2.

Compare and contrast the temperature change of your gas with the three
other gases? Which one showed the lowest temperature rise? Which one
showed the greatest temperature rise?

3.

What was the apparent effect of adding CO2, CH4 and H20 on temperature?

4.

Although this activity is an investigation into thermal properties of several
gases found in the atmosphere, it is not meant to be a model for what is
occurring in the atmosphere. In what way is Earth’s atmosphere different
than what is found in the bottle? How does Earth’s atmosphere differ in
composition and what processes are occurring in the atmosphere that are
not occurring in the bottle? The phenomenon that this activity explores is
typically called the “greenhouse effect.” Do you think this is a good term to
use? (Explain why or why not.)

Temperature is a number. That number is related to energy, but it is not energy
itself. It is related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance.
So, temperature is not energy. That’s why, technically, we measure thermal energy
not temperature.
Incandescent light bulbs give off most of their energy in the form of heat-carrying
infrared light photons -- only about 10 percent of the light produced is in the visible
spectrum (this is why incandescent light bulbs waste a lot of electricity). However,
as greenhouse gases are most responsive to the infrared portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum incandescent bulbs are a good choice for this activity.

The term "greenhouse effect" is actually poorly named as one typically thinks of a
greenhouse as a place where trapped air is warmed. This is not the case with our
atmosphere, which is a porous layer through which electromagnetic radiation, both
short wave, visible (and ultraviolet) light energy and longer wave, infrared energy,
travel.
Visible light, as well as ultraviolet light, travels from the Sun to the Earth. Some of
this energy (about 1/3) is reflected back to space by the upper atmosphere, but
most of the rest travels unimpeded to the surface of the earth where it is absorbed,
The earth radiates infrared energy out into space. However, some of this energy
gets "captured" by a layer of GHG (greenhouse gases) as it leaves Earth. Some of
the energy captured by these little critters is sent back into space; but some of it
gets deflected back to Earth. The rest is absorbed by other CO2 (or other GHG)
molecules. and the process is repeated.
Even though it's an inaccurate metaphor, the name "greenhouse" effect still
persists. And the gases that are part of our atmosphere are sorted out according to
the way they redirect energy or let it pass through. Greenhouse gases - carbon
dioxide, water vapor, and methane - are champs at capturing the heat energy and
redirecting it everywhere, including back towards Earth.
