The physical layer of a communication link covers the aspects of physical
data transmission between the nodes of a network. In this presentation, the
requirements of CAN physical layers and some existing concepts are
discussed.
The MAC (Medium Access Control) layer of the CAN protocol defines the
non-destructive bit-wise arbitration, so that the message with highest prior
identifier will get the bus. Therefore, any CAN physical layer has to support
the representation of a recessive and a dominant state on the transmission
medium. The transmission shall be in the recessive state if no bus node
transmit a dominant bit. If one or multiple bus nodes transmit a dominant
bit, then the transmission medium shall enter the dominant state, thus
overwriting the recessive state.

The CAN physical layer can be divided in three sub-layers. The PLS
layer is implement in the CAN controller chips. The PMA layer
describes the transceiver characteristics. The MDI layer specifies the
cable and connector characteristics.
The PMA and MDI layers are subject of different international,
national and industry standards as well as proprietary specifications.
Most common is the ISO 11898 standard specifying a high-speed
transceiver for CAN-based networks.

The bit stream in a CAN message is coded according to the NonReturn-to-Zero (NRZ) method. This means that during the total bit
time the generated bit level is either ÔdominantÕ or ÔrecessiveÕ. The
alternative method, the Manchester coding, requires in each bit a
falling or rising edge, which leads to higher frequency.

One characteristic of Non-Return-to-Zero code is that the signal
provides no edges that can be used for resynchronization if
transmitting a large number of consecutive bits with the same
polarity. Therefore bit-stuffing is used to ensure synchronization of all
bus nodes. This means that during the transmission of a message, a
maximum of five consecutive bits may have the same polarity.
The bit-stuff area in a CAN frame includes the SOF, Arbitration field,
Control field, Data field and CRC field.

Because the Control Field of the CAN Data Frame contains two
reserved bits of dominant value and the Data Length Code the
practical maximum number of stuff-bits is not the same as
theoretically calculated.
The shown table is the result of simulation for all possible CAN
Standard Frames. There is no frame with the maximum number of
stuff-bits existing. CAN frames with a Data Length Code of 7 contain
more stuff-bits in average than the others. This is why the DLC has
the value of 0111 (0 = dominant, 1 = recessive).

One bit time is specified as four non-overlapping time segments (see
next slide). Each segment is constructed from an integer multiple of
the Time Quantum (tq). The Time Quantum is the smallest discrete
timing resolution used by a CAN node. Its length is generated by a
programmable divide of the CAN nodeÕs oscillator frequency. There is
a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 25 Time Quanta per bit. The bit
time is selected by programming the width of the Time Quantum and
the number of Time Quanta in the various segments. This has to be
done in the CAN controllers.

Basically the CAN bit period can be subdivided into four time
segments. Each time segment consists of a number of Time Quanta.
¥ SYNC_SEG is 1 Time Quantum long. It is used to synchronize the
various bus nodes.
¥ PROP_SEG is programmable to be 1, 2,... 8 Time Quanta long. It is
used to compensate for signal delays across the network.
¥ PHASE_SEG1 is programmable to be 1,2, ... 8 Time Quanta long. It
is used to compensate for edge phase errors and may be lengthened
during resynchronization.
¥ PHASE_SEG2 is the maximum of PHASE_SEG1 and the
Information Processing Time long. It is also used to compensate
edge phase errors and may be shortened during resynchronization.
¥ Information Processing Time is less than or equal to 2 Time Quanta
long.
¥ The total number of Time Quanta has to be from 8 to 25.
Programming of the Sample Point allows optimizing the Bit Timing: A
late sampling for example allows a maximum bus length; an early
sampling allows slower rising and falling edges.

Signal Propagation for Hard-Synchronization

© CiA

It is necessary to compensate for signal propagation delays on the
bus line and through the electronic interface circuits of the bus nodes.
The sum of the propagation delay times of controller, optional
galvanic isolation, transceiver and bus line has to be less than the
length of the Propagation Time Segment (Prop_Seg) within one Bit.
You have to add up the following delays depending on the selected
components: CAN controller (50 ns to 62 ns), optocoupler (40 ns to
140 ns), transceiver (120 ns to 250 ns), and cable (about 5 ns/m).
These delays have to be considered twice, because after hard
synchronization the most far away node is expect switching edges
with delay of the propagation time, and the bit of the transmitter has
to wait another propagation time to guarantee that the identifier bit or
the Acknowledge slot bit of the Receiver is valid. Using ISO 11898
compliant transceiver and high-speed optocoupler you can reach a
maximum bus length of 9 meters at 1 Mbit/s.

But it is allowed to use bridge-devices or repeaters to increase the
allowed distance between ISO 11898 compliant nodes to more than 1

The maximum achievable bus line length in a CAN network is
determined essentially by the following physical effects:
¥ the loop delays of the connected bus nodes and the delay of the
bus lines
¥ the differences in bit time quantum length due to the relative
oscillator tolerance between nodes
¥ the signal amplitude drop due to the series resistance of the bus
cable and the input resistance of bus nodes
The shown practical bus length can be reached with ISO 11898
compliant transceivers and standard bus line cables. Note, there are
no optocouplers considered.

A CAN network consists of several nodes, each clocked with its
individual oscillator. Because of this, phase shifts can occur in
different nodes. Each CAN controller provides a resynchronization
(soft synchronization) mechanism to compensate phase shifts while
receiving a CAN frame.
An edge is expected in the Sync_Seg. In the case of a slower
transmitter meaning the edge is detected in the Prop_Seg, the
receiver lengthens the Phase_Seg1 with a maximum of the
programmed value of the Resynchronization Jump Width (RJW = 1 ..
4 tq).

There are several official and industry standards dealing with CAN
medium attachment.
Most important for general purpose applications is the CAN highspeed standard ISO 11898.
The ISO 11519-1 specification will be withdrawn in the near future,
and is only used by the German LBS standard (DIN 9684) for
agriculture machines.
Fault-tolerant transceivers used in car body electronics will be
standardized by the ISO TC22 SC3 WG1.
The ISO 11992 standard was originally developed for truck/trailer
connections, and provides also fault-tolerant capability.
A SAE task force is working on a single-wire transmission
specification.
Proprietary fiber-optical solutions as well as wire-less transmission
are available.
A power-supply transmission is possible but not commercially
available due to the high price of the transceiver.

An ISO 111898-2 compliant bus node requires a microcontroller and
a CAN controller, which is connected to the transceiver via a serial
data output line (Tx) and a serial data input line (Rx). The reference
voltage output Vref provides an output voltage of 0.5 X Vcc nominal.
The transceiver has to be powered with a nominal supply voltage of
+5 V.
At static conditions the differential input voltage at a bus node is
determined by the current flowing through the differential input
resistance of that node. In case of a dominant bit the output
transistors of the transmitting node are switched on, causing a
current flow, whereas the transistors are switched off for a recessive
bit.

A CAN controller is connected to the ISO 11898 compliant
transceiver via the Tx serial data output line and the Rx serial input
line. The transceiver is attached to the bus line via its two bus
terminals CAN-H and CAN_L., which provide differential receive and
transmit capability. Tx and Rx are direction-related signals. The
differential signal between CAN_H and CAN_L is undirected.
Each transmitting CAN node reads the output back; but there is delay
between the bits transmitted and the according received bits to be
consider.

The CAN in Automation (CiA) international users and manufacturers
group has recommended some baud rates to be used in general
purpose CAN networks as well as the maximum bus length for a
given baud rate. In addition, the bit-timing is recommended, so that
nodes from different manufacturers can be connected to one CAN
network without calculating the bit-timing parameters.

These recommended DC parameters for bus line cables are suitable
for ISO 11898-2 based networks. To minimize the voltage drop on
long distances the termination resistor should be higher than in the
ISO 11898-2 standard.
The system integrator has to consider the DC parameters for the
connectors as well. To calculate the voltage drop, he has to add for
each node with 9-pin D-Sub connector about 5 m W to 20 m W to the
total transmission resistance.

The table provides a first indication on which kind of wire cross
section should be considered for the signal pair of the bus trunk cable
(Philips Application Note AN96116 for the PCA82C250/1 CAN
Transceiver). The table bases on the following assumptions:
¥ 32 nodes: Rw < 21 W
¥ 64 nodes: Rw < 18.5 W,
¥ 100 nodes: Rw < 16 W.
Ground potential shifts should not lead to a fall of voltage of more
than 2 V.

The wiring-topology of a CAN-network should be as close as possible
to a single line structure in order to avoid cable-reflected waves.
Essentially it depends on the bit timing parameters, the trunk cable
length Lt and the drop cable length Ld whether reflections will be
tolerated. In practice short stubs Ld are necessary to connect devices
to the bus line successfully. They should be as short as possible,
especially at high bit rates. At 1 Mbit/s the length of the cable stubs
should not exceed 0.3 m.

Basically each of the termination resistors is spit into two resistors of
equal value, i.e. two resistors of 62 Ohm instead of one resistor of
124 Ohm.The special characteristic of this approach is that the socalled common-mode signal is available at the center tap to the
termination. As the common-mode signal is simply a DC voltage in
the ideal case, this center tap can be grounded via a capacitor.
However it is obvious that the capacitor should be connected to a
ÔquitÕ ground level. For example a separate ground lead to the
connectorÕs ground pin is recommended, if termination is placed
inside of bus nodes.

In some applications a topology different from a single line structure
is needed, e.g. a star topology with three branches. To accommodate
such a topology, the multiple termination concept may be considered.
Essentially this approach suggests, that the total termination
resistance is being distributed over more than two resistors. If for
example a star topology is needed with three branches, then one may
consider to terminate each branch with about three times the total
termination resistance. With this approach it is essential that the total
termination resistance does suit the transceiverÕs output drive
capability.

Daimler-Benz has patented a star topology with common termination in the
star. This topology overcomes resonance problems and undesired harmonies
and is insensitive to incoming disturbing signals.
To understand why there is only one termination, it should be noted that a
one-side termination of a transmission line is sufficient to avoid resonance,
because a wave traveling toward the termination point will be absorbed
there and never reflected again.

Fault-tolerant transceivers are primarily intended for low-speed
applications, up to 125 kbit/s, in passenger cars.The device provides
differential transmit capability but will switch in error conditions to a
single-wire transmitter and/or receiver.
In the supported failure cases all nodes continue communication with
reduced signal-to-nose ratio. Once the wire corruption is removed,
the fault-tolerant transceiver automatically resumes differential signal
transmission.
Fault-tolerant transceivers will be standardized in the ISO 11898-3
document. A New Work Item Proposal (NWIP) will be submitted to
the ISO TC22 SC3 WG1 in Fall 1999.

During normal operation several bus failures may occur that may
influence the bus operation. In several applications, in particular in
car body electronics, fault- tolerance capability is required.
Except in case 8 the transceiver will indicate the failure to the
microcontroller via a dedicated error flag output. This signal can be
used for diagnostic purposes.

The fault-tolerant transceiver was originally specified by DaimlerBenz and other passenger car manufacturers. This approach will
substitute the ISO 11519-1 standard.
The dominant bit is represented by 3.6 V (CAN_H) and 1.4 V
(CAN_L) meaning there is difference voltage of 2.2 V; the recessive
bit difference voltage is 5 V (CAN_H = 0 V and CAN_L = 5 V).

Transceiver compliant with ISO 11992 provide fault-tolerant capability
on wiring failures. This standard was primarily developed for truck
and van applications to withstand high common mode HF emission
(more than 100 V) and high ground offsets (about 6 V). Some
external circuitry is necessary to get this results, and also some
current consumption must be accepted.
The dominant bit values are 18 V at CAN_H line and 9 V at CAN_L
line (difference voltage = 9 V). The recessive bit has also a difference
voltage of 9 V, but the CAN_H line is 9 V and the CAN_L line is 18 V.
ISO 11992 compliant transceivers are manufactured by Temic
(B10011S).

Due to the large coupling losses in passive starcoupler solutions it
was not possible to carry data over a distance longer than 5 m to 10
m.
For the definition of the active starcoupler the bus structure was left
and the fieldbus melded into one point, the starpoint device. The CAN
bus is now limited to the star point and is only a few cm long,
interconnecting the different optical links. The starcoupler is able to
handle a number of links restricted only by the transceiver
characteristics.
In this approach the optocoupler used in traditional control
applications is substituted by the optical transmission path. The
optical Transmitter/Receiver-Pair resides in the bus nodes and in the
active starcoupler.

In some applications it is an advantage to control a system without
using a wire-based transmission. A typical case is when two moving
sub-systems have to communicate , e.g. in a crane or an excavator
or in a tank.
The simplest application for a remote link is the point-to-point link:
e.g. break open the existing CAN bus and throws in a pair of CAN RF
gateway to accommodate a large distance, a moving target, or
anything similar.
A radio frequency connection can be used as a transparent link
between two or more CAN nets but can also be set up to pass only
certain messages.
