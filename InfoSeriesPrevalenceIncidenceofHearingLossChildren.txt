  The number of Americans with a hearing loss has 

evidentially doubled during the past 30 years. Data 
gleaned from federal surveys illustrate the following 
trend of prevalence for individuals age 3 years or older 
with a hearing loss: 13.2 million (1971), 14.2 million 
(1977), 20.3 million (1991), and 24.2 million (1993).1,2 An 
independent researcher estimates that 28.6 million 
Americans had an auditory disorder in 2000.3 This 
estimate is reasonably well within projections from the 
19711993 trend line that evolved from federal surveys.4   
  Children who are hard of hearing will find it much more 
difficult than children who have normal hearing to learn 
vocabulary, grammar, word order, idiomatic expressions, 
and other aspects of verbal communication.5 

  The number of children with disabilities, ages 621, who 
were served in the public schools under the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B in the 2000-
01 school year was 5,775,722 (in the 50 states, District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico). Of these children, 70,767 
(1.2%) received services for hearing. However, the 
number of children with hearing loss and deafness is 
undoubtedly higher, since many of these students may 
have other disabilities as well.6 Data by disability are not 
reported by the Department of Education for ages birth to 
5 years.  

  Several studies indicate variance in the prevalence of 
newborns with congenital hearing loss in the United 
States. The overall estimates are between 1 and 6 per 
1,000 newborns.7,8 Most children with congenital hearing 
loss have hearing impairment at birth and are potentially 
identifiable by newborn and infant hearing screening. 
However, some congenital hearing loss may not become 
evident until later in childhood.9  

  According to Blanchfield et al.,10 as many as 738,000 

individuals in the United States have severe to profound 
hearing loss. Of these, almost 8% are under the age of 18.  

  Among African American, Cuban American, Mexican 

American, Puerto Rican, and non-Hispanic White 
children, it is estimated that approximately 391,000 
school-age children in the United States have unilateral 
hearing loss.11  

  According to Niskar and colleagues,12 approximately 

14.9% of U.S. children have low-frequency or high-
frequency hearing loss of at least 16 dB HL in one or both 
ears.  

  Profound, early-onset deafness is present in 411 per 

10,000 children and is attributable to genetic causes in at 
least 50% of cases.13
