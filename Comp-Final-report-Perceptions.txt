EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY      JULY 2011  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Exmoor Landscape Perceptions Study provides important data on how members of the 
public  perceive  each  of  the  landscape  types  within  Exmoor  National  Park.    Over  the 
course  of  a  year,  volunteers  surveyed  325  members  of  the  public  at  agreed  sites 
throughout  the  National  Park,  recording  how  respondents  described  each  of  the 
landscape types, and their emotional response to the landscape. It also recorded data on 
how Exmoor is valued in terms of the cultural services it offers, as well as the publics 
response  to  landscape  change.    Its  results  will  inform  the  forthcoming  review  of  the 
Exmoor National Park Management Plan.   
 
The  Exmoor  Landscape  Perceptions  Study  has  provided  statistical  evidence  for  subjective 
responses  which  can  easily  be  taken  for  granted,  such  as  peoples  appreciation  of 
Exmoors  variety  and  scenic  beauty,  and  the  high  levels  of  tranquillity  achieved  at  many 
locations throughout the National Park. Its results indicate that the statutory purposes of 
the  National  Park  are  being  successfully  fulfilled,  and  that  Exmoors  special  qualities  are 
being retained.  The study therefore endorses the effectiveness of current management by 
landowners, farmers and the National Park Authority, and demonstrates the importance 
of continued good management of all parts of the National Park in the future.   

The  overwhelming  conclusion  of  this  study  is  the  publics  appreciation  of  ALL  types  of 
landscape within Exmoor National Park, reflected in the words used to describe different 
landscapes, and in the positive emotional responses that those landscapes evoke.  It also 
confirms  the  emotional  benefits  of  Exmoor  (and  presumably  other  National  Parks)  to 
individuals, and  collectively  to society as a whole. 
 
Respondents  used  a  total  of  262  adjectives  to  describe  the  various  views,  ranging 
alphabetically  from  beautiful  to  wow!  Beautiful  and  peaceful  were  the  top  two 
adjectives  overall,  and  feature  near  the  top  of  the  lists  for  most  of  the  individual  sites.  
However, further down the lists the adjectives for each area become more place-specific.  
For  example,  Brendon  Common  (purple,  open,  vast,  expansive)  contrasts  with 
Watersmeet (river valley, rocky, water rushing, fairytale, dramatic) and Woody Bay 
Station (pastoral, rural, livestock, farmland, sloping hills). 
 
The emotional responses to the Exmoor landscape were overwhelmingly positive.  A total 
of  144  different  emotions  were  expressed,  with  relaxed,  happy,  peaceful  and  calm 
being  the  clear  top  four.    Again,  further  down  the  lists  for  each  survey  site,  a  greater 
variety  of  emotions  begin  to  appear,  for  example  observant,  close  to  the  sky,  elated 
and  expectant  were  only  associated  with  upland  moorland  sites,  whereas  protected, 
delighted, mesmerized and reflective were only associated with valley/ woodland sites.  
When  asked  directly,  86.8%  of  respondents  felt  relaxed,  79.1%  felt  happy,  69.5%  felt 
uplifted, 0.3% felt intimidated, 0.6% felt uncomfortable and 2.8% felt melancholic.  
 
Demographic  factors  (age,  gender,  place  of  residence)  and  environmental  factors 
(weather, season) do not appear to affect whether people feel relaxed, happy or uplifted 
in  the  different  landscape  types,  although  data  on  ethnicity  and  socio-economic  status 
(which  may  influence  peoples  response)  were  not  collected  for  this  study.      From  this

study,  therefore,  it  appears  that  it  is  the  different  combinations  of  landscape  elements 
(rivers, coast, moorland, field patterns etc.) and landscape qualities (openness, enclosure, 
wildness) which create different emotional responses in people.   
 
Exmoors landscape provides a wide variety of cultural services, although comparison of 
this study with previous research suggests that Exmoors landscape provides slightly 
different cultural services for residents and visitors. 
 
12.7% of previous visitors had noticed negative changes in the landscape, and 23.9% had 
noticed positive changes.  The ranges of both positive and negative changes are quite wide 
and cover many different land management issues, but no specific issues were repeatedly 
mentioned at different survey sites.  Residents of the National Park were more likely to 
observe landscape changes than occasional visitors.     
 
Finally, respondents expressed a number of favourite views and routes within the National 
Park.  These ranged from well-known viewpoints to secret spots and encompassed many 
different landscape character types, although coastal routes were particularly popular.

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: INTRODUCTION      JULY 2011  

1.0 

INTRODUCTION 
 

1.0.1  This report was commissioned jointly by Exmoor National Park Authority (ENPA) and the 
Exmoor  Society.    It  was  prepared  by  Fiona  Fyfe,  with  assistance  from  Emma  Dennis  of 
ENPA  and  a  group  of  dedicated  volunteers  who  carried  out  the  questionnaire  surveys, 
whose  commitment  of  time,  energy  and  enthusiasm  we  gratefully  acknowledge.      We 
would  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  contribution  of  statistician  Fiona  Stott,  who  helped 
with the questionnaire and spreadsheet design, and with the data analysis. 
 

1.0.2  The  report  is  intended  to  inform  the  forthcoming  review  of  the  Exmoor  National  Park 
Management  Plan.    It  will  also  contribute  to  the  meeting  the  following  two  objectives 
within the existing Exmoor National Management Plan 2007-2012: 
 
A4.1: Base-line data from the public on what is important to them in the landscape and why will 
be established by the end of 2012. 
 
A4.2:  A  survey  of  the  different  views  on  perceptual  landscape  characteristics  such  as  scenic 
quality, tranquillity and wildness will be completed and the results taken into account by the end 
of 2012.   
 

1.0.3  The  report  is  particularly  timely  given  the  coalition  Governments  wish  to  measure  and 
quantify peoples levels of happiness, and it ties in with previous research projects  which 
address how people relate to landscape and what the benefits and values of landscape are 
to society.   
 

1.0.4  The aim of the report is to explore the following four questions: 

x What is important to the public in the Exmoor landscape and why? 
x How  do  people  perceive  the  different  landscape  types  within  Exmoor  National 

Park? 

x What factors influence that perception? 
x How should this affect management policies and strategies? 

 

1.0.5  Following a section presenting background information, the first three of these questions 
are  addressed  in  the  Results  section,  with  the  fourth  addressed  in  the  Conclusions  and 
Recommendations section.  References and sources of further information are provided at 
the end of the report, along with Appendices describing the survey sites and summarising 
the  key  qualities  of  each  landscape  type,  and  containing  full  answers  to  the  open-ended 
questions.

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: BACKGROUND      JULY 2011  

2.0  BACKGROUND 

 
2.1 

Landscape Character Assessment and the importance of landscape perception 
 
The European Landscape Convention 

2.1.0  The European Landscape Convention (ratified by the UK in 2006) defines landscape as: 

 
An  area,  as  perceived  by  people,  whose  character  is  the  result  of  the  action  and 
interaction of natural and/or human factors (emphasis added)  

 
This definition puts peoples perception of landscape as a central consideration. It has led 
to  new  interest  in  understanding  how  people  relate  to  and  perceive  the  world  around 
them, and how the findings of research on the subject can be practically applied. 
 

2.1.1  The Oxford pocket dictionary definition of perceive is: 

 

Apprehend with the mind or through one of the senses, observe, notice, understand. 
 

Landscape perception is about our response to landscape- how it makes us feel and the 
reactions it evokes in us.  This project utilises the contrasting landscapes within Exmoor 
to see if people respond differently to the various landscapes within the National Park.  
 
Landscape Characterisation Methodology 

2.1.3  Peoples perceptions of landscape are an important part of the landscape characterisation 
process,  as  explained  in  the  Countryside  Agency/  Scottish  Natural  Hertiage  (SNH) 
Landscape Character Assessment Guidance (2002), p.35 para. 5.14: 
 
Any consensus views gained through the involvement of stakeholders can also play an important 
part  in  indicating  the  importance  of  these  perceptions  of  landscape,  which  make  such  a  key 
contribution to character.  Stakeholders will often have special knowledge about an area which 
will mean that their perceptions are influenced by particular associations which a landscape may 
have. 
 
Para.  5.14  gives  the  following  examples  of  perceptual  aspects  of  landscape.    Some  are 
visual; others rely on other senses too:

Beauty/ scenic attractiveness

In  Topic  Paper  3,  the  Countryside  Agency/  SNH  Landscape  Character  Assessment 
Guidance describes the importance of communities of place (para 1.6) and the need to 
involve  the  people  who  live,  work  and  visit  a  particular  area  in  the  landscape 
characterisation  process.  This  report  therefore  complements  the  existing  Exmoor 
Landscape  Character  Assessment,  enabling  the  subjective  responses  of  individuals  to  be 
represented,  as  well  as  the  professional  judgement  which  has  already  been  written  into 
the Landscape Character Assessment. 

 
 

Landscape Types within Exmoor 
 

2.1.5 

2.2 

 

2.2.1  Exmoor is a landscape of contrasts- from open elevated moorland to enclosed, wooded 
river valleys; from soft, green farmland to jagged coastal cliffs. It is these wide variations in 
landscape within a relatively small area which make the Exmoor landscape so distinctive 
and interesting, and also make it an ideal subject for a study such as this one. 
 

2.2.2  The  Exmoor  Landscape  Character  Assessment  (completed  in  2007)  identified  nine 
distinctive  landscape  types  within  the  National  Park  (shown  in  fig.  2  overleaf)  and  listed 
below.    Photographs  of  each  of  the  nine  landscape  types,  and  summaries  of  their  key 
qualities are provided in Appendix 1.

2.3  Brief review of previous studies of Exmoor 

 

2.3.1  How people respond to and value landscape has been the subject of a large number of 
recent publications.  Several of these are listed in the References and sources of further 
reading.    What  follows  here  is  a  brief  summary  of  previous  reports  which  relate 
specifically to Exmoor.  It is not intended to be a full literature review.   
 
Moorlands at a Crossroads Land Use Consultants (2004) 

2.3.2  This  report,  commissioned  by  the  Exmoor  Society,  aimed  to  provide  an  independent 
evaluation of the state of Exmoors moorlands, and to guide the Exmoor Societys work in 
promoting the conservation and enjoyment of Exmoor.  It included the results of a postal 
survey  sent  out  to  all  Exmoor  Society  members  to  obtain  their  views  on  the  special 
qualities of Exmoor (Sections 3.41-3.49).  When asked to rank which landscape elements 
were most special to their appreciation of Exmoor, many respondents commented along 
the lines of you can only take Exmoor as a whole! and Exmoor is a unity....  However, 
on the basis of rankings given, the moorland came out as the most important landscape 
element  (77%)  followed  by  the  coast  (30%);  woodland  and  rivers  (both  23%);  villages 
(10%) and farmland (9%).   
 

2.3.3  When  asked  to  identify  the  qualities  of  the  moorlands  that  make  them  special  to  their 
appreciation of Exmoor, the three qualities of views and openness, peacefulness,  and 
wildness  and  remoteness  were  the  most  popular,  chosen  by  94%,  92%  and  89%  of 
respondents respectively.  These aesthetic and perceptual qualities came out higher than 
other  qualities  such  as  flora,  fauna  and  archaeology,  indicating  the  importance  of 
perceptual qualities in how this sample of people value Exmoors landscapes. 
 

2.3.4  Different types of moorland were valued for different reasons.  For example, the Coastal 
Heaths were particularly highly valued for their views; the Northern Heather Moors for 
their flora and fauna, and the Central Grass Moors for their wildness and remoteness.   
 
 
Experiencing  Landscapes:  Capturing  the  Cultural  Services  and  Experiential 
Qualities of Landscape by The Research Box, in association with Land Use Consultants 
and Rick Minter, published by Natural England in 2009.  
 

2.3.5  This  wide-ranging  report  presents  the  results  of  a  programme  of  qualitative  social 
research into how people relate to and value the landscape and its component elements.  
The  research  was  carried  out  in  eight  contrasting  National  Character  Areas  (NCAs), 
around England, including Exmoor.  The report raises many interesting points in relation 
to peoples attitudes towards landscape and the elements within it.   
 

2.3.6  Eight  cultural  services  provided  by  landscape  were  examined,  which  were  felt  to 
represent a wide scope of services which would offer a structure for capturing peoples 
responses.  These were: 
 

x A sense of history (or heritage);

Inspiration (stimulus); 

x A sense of place (identity, home); 
x
x Calm (relaxation, tranquillity); 
x
x
x
x

Leisure and activities (recreation); 
Spiritual; 
Learning (education), and; 
Escapism (getting away from it all).   

 

2.3.7  The study concluded that all landscapes deliver all of the cultural services identified to a 
greater or lesser extent, although some landscape elements are big hitters in terms of 
the  range  of  cultural  services  delivered,  including  water,  rivers  and  streams,  the  coast, 
mountains and hills, moorland, field systems and villages.   
 

2.3.8  As well as examining peoples responses to particular landscape features, the study also 
addressed  how  people  responded  to  the  composition  of  the  landscape,  for  example, 
variety/  simplicity;  natural  vs.  man-made;  openness/  enclosure    and  also  its  quality  and 
condition.    In  summary,  people  preferred  the  ability  to  see  patterns,  colours,  layers  of 
views  and  boundaries,  so  complex  landscapes  well-punctuated  with  features  were  often 
preferred to simple ones.  People perceived naturalness in different ways.  Although the 
best landscape experiences were predominantly natural in the sense of being green and 
rural, respondents often liked the presence of man-made features to achieve a sense of 
history, community or accessibility, particularly if these features blended in (old churches, 
thatched roofs etc.).  Openness seemed to be valued more than enclosure and was a main 
contributor  towards  escapism.    However,  enclosure  could  create  variety  with  the 
contrast making open views more impressive.  It could also increase the sense of peace 
and isolation by shielding the surroundings (and other people).   People generally had a 
limited  ability  to  judge  the  landscape  in  terms  of  quality  and  condition,  or  to  perceive 
change in natural features. However, improving landscape quality was evidenced through 
better-kept  hedges,  information  signs  and  the  return  of  wildlife  through  better  land 
management.   
 

2.3.9  Many of the participants in the Exmoor survey expressed a strong allegiance to Exmoor 
and its landscape. Participants feedback suggested that Exmoor is seen as a highly distinct 
area with a clear identity, offering a wide range of cultural services.  There appeared to be 
a strong sense of place coming from the distinctive character of both the moorland itself 
and the landscapes diversity.  Compared with other NCAs, Exmoor scored particularly 
highly in terms of sense of place, inspiration, calm, leisure activities, spiritual and escapism. 
 

2.3.10  To  a  great  degree,  the  perceived  lack  of  change  was  valued  in  the  Exmoor  landscape.  
Overall it was regarded as a high-quality area with a high aesthetic value, although some 
threats to the landscape were identified, including increased traffic, speeding motorbikes, 
visual clutter from road signs, poor quality development and certain agricultural changes 
such as biomass crops and use of plastic sheeting.    
 

2.3.11  The  Exmoor  sample  was  largely  made  up  of  local  residents,  rather  than  visitors,  and 
consisted  of  workshops  attended  by  people  mainly  (but  not  exclusively)  from  the

northern part of the National Park.  The Experiencing Landscapes report considers Exmoor 
as  a  whole  and  does  not  make  any  distinction  between  the  different  landscape  types 
present within the Exmoor NCA.  The Exmoor Landscape Perceptions Study therefore looks 
at  the  Exmoor  landscape  in  much  more  detail,  and  deliberately  addresses  some  of  the 
issues  raised  in  the  Issues  for  Further  Study  (Section  11)  of  the  Experiencing  Landscapes 
report, such as interviewing visitors as well as local residents, and addressing the question 
of whether people perceive change in the landscape.  For the Exmoor Landscape Perceptions 
Study,  interviews  were  carried  out  throughout  the  National  Park  and  undertaken 
outdoors, looking at a specific view, as described in the Methodology section below.

3.0  METHODOLOGY 

 

3.0.1  A  total  of  11  survey  sites  were  selected  throughout  Exmoor  National  Park.    One  was 
located in each of the nine landscape types (carefully chosen with a view as representative 
of that landscape type as possible), plus two others- one (Cosgate Hill) with a view over 
several different landscape types, and one (Fyldon Ridge) with expansive views outside the 
National  Park.    A  questionnaire  survey  of  members  of  the  public  was  undertaken  by 
volunteers  at  each  site.    Surveys  were  undertaken  throughout  the  course  of  a  year  in 
order  to  assess  the  impacts  of  the  changing  seasons  on  how  people  perceive  the 
landscape.    The  location  of  the  survey  sites  is  shown  in  fig.  3.    Volunteers  were 
encouraged to approach a range of people in terms of age and gender, and to try to get a 
mixture of visitors and local residents.

4.0  RESULTS 

 

 

4.0.1  This section looks firstly at the sample of respondents and the background data on age, 
gender etc. It then presents the results of the survey in relation to the first three of the 
broad  questions  which  the  study  set  out  to  address.    The  fourth  question,  relating  to 
management recommendations, will be answered in the following section.

4.1.2  Most respondents were either 25-50 or 50+.  These two groups accounted for 80.6% off 
all respondents.  The least represented age bracket was 16-25 (6.8%) although whether 
this was because this age group were at school/ university or working when the surveys 
were undertaken, or whether it is because there genuinely are fewer people of this age in 
the National Park cannot be ascertained from this survey.

4.1.3  Roughly  equal  proportions  of  men  and  women  were  surveyed  (39.4%  and  45.5% 
respectively).    There  ware  also  some  couples  and  families  who  completed  the  survey 
together.   
 
Q.1: How often do you visit Exmoor? 

How often do you visit Exmoor?

Fig. 6: Frequency of visits to Exmoor 
 

4.1.4  The  greatest  proportion  of  respondents  (29.2%)  visit  Exmoor  more  than  once  a  year, 
indicating a good level of repeat visits to the National Park.  The other four categories: 
Live here; More than once a month; Once every few years and Only visit were also well 
represented. 
 
Q2: What is the reason for your visit here today? 

4.1.5  This  was  a  free-response  question,  as  it  was  only  intended  to  explain  respondents 
answers to later questions.  As an extreme example, if the reason someone was visiting 
was  to  scatter  grannys  ashes  then  we  wouldnt  expect  them  to  be  feeling  particularly 
cheerful!   
 

4.1.6  By far the greatest number (29.5%) of respondents said they were on holiday, followed by 
walking, day trip, and dog-walking. Only 4 respondents (1.25%) were working.  Several 
of the under-16s were training for Duke of Edinburgh or Ten Tors expeditions and others 
were geocaching.  More unusual reasons for being at a survey site included being lost, a 
new camera and cycling from Lands End to John OGroats!

Fig.7: Where respondents live 
 

4.1.7 Only  8.3%  of  respondents  lived  within  the  National  Park.  The  sites  with  the  highest 
proportion of local people (often dog walkers) were Nutcombe Bottom, Porlock Marsh 
and  Selworthy.  30.8  %  of  respondents  were  from  Devon  or  Somerset  but  outside  the 
National Park, and 60.6% were from further afield. These figures illustrate the local and 
national  appeal  of  Exmoor,  and  represent  a  different  make-up  of  respondents  from  the 
earlier  study  by  Research  Box  et  al.(2009),  where  the  vast  majority  of  responses  came 
from local people.   
 
Q4: Where did you grow up?

4.1.8  The vast majority of respondents grew up in the countryside or a town/suburb (43.1% and 
41.2%  respectively).  Only  15.1%  grew  up  in  a  city.    If  this  figure  is  representative  it 
suggests people who grew up in the countryside/ town wish to return to the countryside, 
and that the wish to visit the countryside is less strong in those who grew up in a city.

4.2  What is important to the public in the Exmoor landscape and why? 

 
Q.9: Which of the following values do you associate with the Exmoor landscape: 
Identity/  sense  of  place/  feelings  of  being  at  home;  Understanding  of  the  past; 
Inspiration; Escapism/ getting away from it all; Relaxation/ tranquillity/ peace and 
quiet;  Spiritual  values;  Learning  and  education;  Leisure  and  recreation;  Having 
quality time? This question was intended to relate to Exmoor as a whole, rather than 
individual landscape character types.   
 

4.2.1  Respondents  associated  Exmoor  with  all  these  cultural  services  (initially  identified  by 
Research  Box  et  al.  (2009).    The  Exmoor  Landscape  Perception  Study  found  that  the 
highest  value  associated  with  Exmoor  was  relaxation/  tranquillity/  peace  and  quiet,  by 
81.5%  of  respondents  overall.    This  was  followed  by  escapism/  getting  away  from  it  all 
(69.5%)  and  having  quality  time  (61.8%),  leisure  and  recreation  (84.5%),  inspiration 
(46.2%)  and  sense  of  place/  being  at  home  (36%).    The  lowest  values  were  associated 
with learning and education, understanding the past and spiritual values, but even these 
were all over 23% (see fig. 8).

Fig. 9: Cultural services provided by the Exmoor Landscape 
 
In general, the results of the Exmoor Landscape Perception Study supported those of the 
Research  Box  report  in  relation  to  Exmoor,  in  that  both  studies  found  Exmoor  to  be 
associated  with  all  the  cultural  services  identified  in  the  Research  Box  report,  but  with 
relatively  low  numbers  of  people  associating  Exmoor  with  learning  and  education  and 
understanding  the  past.    However,  the  higher  number  of  respondents  and  the  wider 
cross-section  of  locals  and  visitors  have  enabled  some  refinement  of  the  Research  Box 
findings.  Firstly, Sense of place/ being at home was one of the strongest responses in the 
Research  Box  survey,  but  relatively  low  in  the  Exmoor  Landscape  Perception  Study 
survey, which instead emphasised the areas association with relaxation/ tranquillity/ peace 
and  quiet.    These  variations  are  likely  to  be  a  result  of  the  different  proportions  of 
residents and visitors in the two surveys, and whether they regard Exmoor as their home 
or  as  somewhere  tranquil  to  visit  for  relaxation.    Spiritual  values  ranked  higher  in  the 
Research Box study than in the Exmoor Landscape Perceptions Study, although as the term is

likely  to  mean  different  things  to  different  people  it  is  difficult  to  compare  this  cultural 
service between studies. 
 
Q.10:  (To  previous  visitors  only)  Have  you  noticed  any  negative  changes  to  the 
scenic quality of the landscape? 

4.2.3  12.7% of previous visitors had noticed negative changes in the landscape.  Some of these 
were  very  site-specific,  such  as  the  new  fence  below  Watersmeet.    Others  were  more 
general,  such  as  dumping  of  rubbish/  litter.    However,  there  were  no  repeated  issues 
which arose repeatedly at different sites.  A full list of responses is provided in Appendix 
2.   
 
Q.11:  (To  previous  visitors  only)  Have  you  noticed  any  positive  changes  to  the 
scenic quality of the landscape? 

4.2.4  23.9% of previous visitors had noticed positive changes in the landscape.  Many of these 
were  recorded  at  Nutcombe  Bottom  and  related  to  the  construction  of  the  Tall  Trees 
Trail and the provision of improved footpaths through the woodland.  Positive comments 
were  recorded  on  many  general  topics  including  moorland  management,  footpaths  and 
signage, but again they were very varied, with few issues being repeatedly mentioned at 
different survey sites.  A full list of responses is provided in Appendix 3. 
 
It  was  noticeable  from  the  answers  to  questions  10  and  11  that  a  higher  percentage  of 
National Park residents perceived landscape change than those who lived in surrounding 
counties  or  further  afield.    Similarly,  frequency  of  visits  also  had  an  impact  on  the 
percentages  of  people  noticing  change,  with  National  Park  residents  the  highest  and 
occasional visitors the lowest.    
 
Q.12: Are there any changes you would like to see? 

4.2.5 

4.2.6  The  answers  to  this  open-ended  question  are  set  out  in  Appendix  4.    The  majority  of 
answers relate to the provision of visitor facilities such as signposts, benches and dog bins.  
Some  relate  directly  to  landscape  management  (e.g.  fewer  conifer  plantations;  greater 
return  to  heather  moor)  and  a  few  relate  to  improvement  of  access  (e.g.  bus  services, 
cycle path provision and access to rivers).  The most frequent request was for litter and 
dog bins.   
 
Q.13: Do you have a favourite landscape view from within Exmoor National Park?  
If yes, where is it, and why do you like it? 

4.2.7  The most popular viewpoint was Dunkery Beacon/ Hill, with the spectacular, panoramic 
views being the most frequent reason for its popularity.  Other popular viewpoints were 
Valley of Rocks, Watersmeet and Tarr Steps.  As the table in Appendix 5 shows, a large 
number  of  favourite  views  were  recorded  located  all  around  the  National  Park.    Many 
different  reasons  were  given  to  explain  why  people  like  these  views,  but  the  majority 
relate  to  the  landscape  in  some  way,  either  through  the  colour  or  composition  of 
elements within the view, or through perceptual qualities such as openness or a sense of 
distance.   Appreciation of changing seasons was also given in several answers.

Q. 14: Do you have a favourite series of views (i.e. along a road or footpath) from 
within Exmoor National Park? If yes, where are they? 

4.2.8  Again, a wide variety of routes were listed, but the top three (the A39 Coast Road, the 
Coastal Path and Woody Bay- Hunters Inn) are all coastal routes.  Variety and contrast of 
scenery were a key reason for peoples choices, which included main roads, minor roads 
and footpaths.  A full set of responses are given in Appendix 6.    
 
 

4.3  How  do  people  perceive  the  different  landscapes  within  Exmoor  National 

Park? 
 
Q5: How would you describe this scene today? 

4.3.1  The most common words given were general adjectives.  A full set of responses are given 

in Appendix 7, but for the survey as a whole, the top 15 words are as follows: 
Beautiful 
Peaceful 
Fantastic 
Pretty 
Stunning 
Lovely 
Picturesque 
Green 
Tranquil 
Amazing 
Natural 
Relaxing 
Breathtaking

4.3.2  This general list reflects the most common descriptive words for each site (listed below), 
which  also  contain  mostly  non  place-specific  adjectives  at  the  top  of  their  lists  such  as 
beautiful and peaceful.  It is interesting to note that the least typical Exmoor sites of 
Fyldon  Ridge,  Nettlecombe  and  Porlock  Marsh  show  the  greatest  variation  when 
compared with the above list for Exmoor as a whole, although two of these sites also had 
relatively small samples. 
 
Brendon Common: Beautiful, stunning, wonderful, peaceful. 
Cosgate Hill: Amazing, beautiful, calm, peaceful. 
Fyldon Ridge: Beautiful, hazy, panoramic. 
Great Hangman Hill: Beautiful, fantastic, breathtaking. 
Nettlecombe: Picturesque. 
Porlock Marsh: Calm, interesting. 
Selworthy: Beautiful, breathtaking, fantastic. 
Tarr Steps: Beautiful, peaceful, sunny. 
Watersmeet: Beautiful, peaceful, spectacular. 
Woody Bay Station: Beautiful, open, green.

4.3.3.  However, further down the lists, the less commonly-used words become far more place-
specific, and it becomes possible to identify each site from the words used to describe it, 
as shown in the examples below: 
 
Brendon common: Remote, spacious, expansive, exhilarating, vast. 
Cosgate Hill: Soft, contrasting topography, varied, rolling moorland, fields. 
Fyldon Ridge: Hazy, panoramic, typical Devon, farmed, expansive 
Great Hangman Hill: spectacular, dramatic, high, open, coastal. 
Nettlecombe:  Picturesque,  Classical  painting,  green,  man-made  and  natural  at  the  same 
time, changing seasons. 
Nutcombe Bottom: Bluebells, wooded, spectacular mature trees, peaceful, with paths. 
Porlock Marsh: Desolate, strange, striking, evocative, barren. 
Selworthy: Gentle, wide-open, colourful, man-made, restful. 
Tarr Steps: Idyllic, noisy, inviting, historically interesting, sublime. 
Watersmeet: River valley, rocky, water rushing, fairytale, dramatic. 
Woody Bay Station: Pastoral, rural, livestock, farmland, sloping hills. 
 
In  all,  262  different  adjectives  were  used  to  describe  the  various  views,  ranging 
alphabetically  from  beautiful  to  wow!  This  variation  is  impressive,  and  illustrates  the 
diversity of perception of landscapes across the National Park, but it is easy to overlook 
given the generic words at the top of each list.   
 
It  is  clear  from  the  positive  nature  of  the  responses  that  respondents  think  extremely 
highly  of  all  parts  of  the  Exmoor  landscape.    The  more  negative  descriptions  generally 
relate  to  the  weather  (wet,  cold)  or  to  the  effects  of  salinisation  on  Porlock  Marsh 
(desolate, barren).  It is also interesting to note how highly the word peaceful features 
on each list, despite the large numbers of people present at some sites such as Tarr Steps 
and Watersmeet.  This suggests an ability by respondents to blot out other people, cars, 
ice cream vans etc. and to focus on the natural and attractive elements of the landscape. It 
also suggests that the sites are sufficiently well-managed so that they retain their beauty in 
spite of the large numbers of visitors.

4.3.6  The views considered to be most wild were Porlock Marsh, Brendon Common and Great 
Hangman  Hill,  suggesting  a  perceived  association  between  moorland  and  wildness.  
Watersmeet also has a high number of responses towards the wild end of the spectrum, 
possibly because of the proximity of water and the steep form of the valley. The views 
considered  to  be  the  most  managed  are  Selworthy,  Nettlecombe,  Fyldon  Ridge  and 
Woody Bay Station, all of which contain a high proportion of farmland.   
 

4.3.7  Even  though  the  reality  is  that  all  of  the  National  Park  is  managed  in  some  way,  the 
perception of respondents is that there is considerable variation in the levels of wildness/ 
management  between  the  different  survey  sites  in  the  National  Park.        Of  all  the 
landscape attributes queried in this question, the responses to wild/ managed showed the 
fewest extremes, with a high proportion of responses in the middle three categories.

4.3.8  Responses regarding the level of enclosure were generally as expected.  Porlock Marsh, 
with its flat topography and big sky was considered to be the most open site, followed by 
the  elevated  sites  of  Great  Hangman  Hill,  Cosgate  Hill,  Brendon  Common  and  Fyldon 
Ridge.    The  site  considered  to  be  most  enclosed  was  the  woodland  site  of  Nutcombe 
Bottom,  where  views  are  enclosed  by  trees.    The  sites  enclosed  by  topography  (Tarr 
Steps and Watersmeet) also had a relatively low number of most open responses.

honeypot  sites  of  Tarr  Steps  and  Watersmeet  having  the  lowest  number  of  most 
tranquil responses.  Interestingly, however,  Watersmeet had no responses at all in the 
two most busy categories, suggesting either that respondents are good at blotting out 
other people (as suggested by the high number of peaceful responses in Q.5 above) or 
that the topography, woodland and current management of the site enable large numbers

of people to be absorbed into the landscape. The sites with the highest number of most 
tranquil responses were Porlock Marsh and Selworthy. 
 

4.3.10  The  sites  with  the  greatest  number  of  most  busy  responses  were  considered  to  be 
Selworthy, Brendon Common, Fyldon Ridge and Tarr Steps.  All but one of these survey 
sites were on roads/ in carparks, and although the roads/ carparks should not have been 
included in the view, if there was moving traffic in the vicinity, it may well have influenced 
peoples responses.  However, not too much should be read into this, as other carpark 
sites (e.g. Nutcombe Bottom; Woody Bay Station) did not record any responses in the 
most busy category. 
 

4.3.11  Across  the  National  Park  as  a  whole,  47.1%  of  respondents  considered  the  scene  they 

were observing to be most tranquil, with 2.5% considering it to be most busy.

three  most  historic  categories.  Selworthy  stands  out  as  being  the  site  considered  by 
respondents  to  be  the  most  historic,  possibly  because  of  the  presence  of  traditional 
buildings in the view.

Common.    However,  this  only  relates  to  one  persons  response,  and  may  be  due  to 
misunderstanding the phrasing of the question or incorrect recording of the answer.

4.3.14  The data for this is overwhelmingly positive, with all but one site receiving 50%-100% of 
responses in the highest scenic quality category.  The exception was Woody Bay station, 
with  42.5%.    Woody  Bay  Station  also  had  the  highest  number  (5%)  of  responses  in  the 
lowest  scenic  quality  category,  although  these  results  may  be  explained  by  the  poor 
weather  during  one  of  the  surveys  there.    Nutcombe  Bottom  also  had  relatively  low 
scores, suggesting that the coniferous forest is not considered to be of such high scenic 
quality as the other landscape types.   
 

4.3.15  Overall, 68% of people considered the views to be of the highest scenic quality, followed 

by 16%, 6.5%, 3.1% down to 0.9% in the lowest quality category.   
 
Q.7: How do you feel emotionally as you look at this scene today? 

4.3.16  The responses for this section were overwhelmingly positive, and are produced in full in 
Appendix 8.  The clear top four emotions over all sites were relaxed (78 respondents), 
happy (63 respondents), peaceful (55 respondents) and calm (42 respondents).    
 

4.3.17  These four emotional responses were also the top responses at Cosgate Hill, Nutcombe 
Bottom,  Selworthy,  Tarr  Steps,  Watersmeet  and  Woody  Bay  (the  farmland  and  valley/ 
woodland sites).  The moorland sites had slight variations, with free replacing happy at 
Brendon  Common,  and  Good  to  be  alive  replacing  calm  at  Great  Hangman  Hill, 
suggesting  that  these  elevated  moorland  sites-  and  the  effort  required  to  reach  them- 
provoked a slightly different emotional response.   
 

4.3.18  Fyldon Ridge had lucky instead of relaxed in the top four, possibly reflecting the fact that 
most respondents at this site were on their way somewhere in a vehicle, rather than at 
their  destination.    Nettlecombe  had  only  relaxed  listed,  but  there  were  only  small 
number  of  responses  at  this  site.      Porlock  Marsh  had  happy,  calm  and  with  wildlife/ 
nature as the top three responses.  peaceful and relaxed were slightly further down the 
list.

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: RESULTS      JULY 2011  

 

4.3.19  A  total  of  144  different  emotions  were  expressed,  and  further  down  the  lists,  the 
variations  in  emotional  response  between  the  different  landscape  types  become  more 
apparent.    For  example,  observant,  close  to  the  sky,  elated  and  expectant  were 
associated  only  with  upland  moorland  sites;  protected,  delighted,  mesmerized, 
reflective and ethereal were associated only with valley/ woodland sites, and serene, at 
rest, thankful and quiet were associated only with farmland sites.   
 

4.3.20  The spiritual nature of peoples response to the landscape was apparent in emotions such 

as thankful to God, spiritual and blessed.   
 

4.3.21  A small number of less positive emotions were also expressed, including claustrophobic, 
insignificant and wistful at valley/ woodland sites; both happy and sad, wet/ miserable 
because of the weather and challenged at farmland sites; distressed, eerie and like the 
darkness  at  Porlock  Marsh,  and  overwhelmed  with  awe  at  upland  moorland  sites.  
Although they only form a tiny proportion of the emotional responses expressed, these 
more  negative  responses  are  important  as  they  allow  people  to  experience  a  range  of 
emotions,  and  also  demonstrate  the  complexity  of  peoples  response  to  the  landscape.  
Negative emotions were usually expressed in conjunction with positive ones.   
 
Q.8  When  you  look  at  this  scene  today,  do  you  feel  any  of  these  emotions: 
Relaxed, happy, uplifted, intimidated, uncomfortable, melancholic?

4.3.22  Overall,  86.6%  of  respondents  felt  relaxed.    Nettlecombe  (which  had  a  smaller  sample 
than  the  other  sites)  had  100%  of  respondents  feeling  relaxed;  Great  Hangman  Hill, 
Nutcombe Bottom, Selworthy and Watersmeet all had over 90% of respondents feeling 
relaxed,  suggesting  that  people  feel  relaxed  in  all  the  types  of  landscape  (i.e.  upland 
moorland, farmland and valley/ woodland).  Tarr Steps and Woody Bay Station both had 
over 80% of respondents feeling relaxed, and the lowest results were from Fyldon Ridge 
and  Brendon  Common,  with  71.4%  and  75%  respectively.    As  mentioned  above,  it  is 
possible that the relatively low result for Fyldon Ridge may be because people there were

4.3.23  A slightly lower overall percentage (79.1%) of respondents said they felt happy.  Again, the 
sites in which people felt happiest represented each of the upland moorland, farmland and 
valley/ woodland types of landscape.  The sites where people felt least happy were Fyldon 
Ridge (possibly for the reasons given above) and Woody Bay Station (possibly as a result 
of the wet weather).

correlation between being on high ground and feeling uplifted, and the sites with a positive 
response of 80% or above again included upland moorland sites (Brendon Common and 
Great Hangman Hill), Farmland (Nettlecombe and Selworthy) and valley/ woodland sites 
(Nutcombe  Bottom  and  Watersmeet).    Three  sites  (Cosgate  Hill,  Porlock  Marsh  and

4.3.25 Only one respondent (at Woody Bay Station) felt intimidated when looking at the view.  It

worse weather conditions (misty moorland, for example).   
 

4.3.26 One person at Tarr Steps and one person at Great Hangman Hill felt uncomfortable; one

Fig. 18: Percentage of respondents feeling melancholic at each landscape character type 
 

4.3.27  All  sites  except  Brendon  Common,  Nettlecombe  and  Tarr  Steps  had  at  least  one 
respondent  feeling  melancholic.    Several  respondents  qualified  their  answers,  saying  yes 
but in a good way or because of the rain.  Porlock Marsh had the highest percentage 
feeling  melancholic,  giving  the  bleakness  of  the  landscape  following  salinization  as  the 
reason.  Feeling melancholic usually occurred in conjunction with other emotions such has 
happy and relaxed, indicating the complexity of peoples responses to landscape, and the 
importance of Exmoor in enabling people to experience a variety of emotions.   
 
 

4.4  What factors influence peoples perception of the different landscapes within 

Exmoor National Park? 
 

4.4.1  The sample of people expressing negative emotions is too small to analyse statistically, and 
(as explained above) the factors which influence those negative perceptions were usually 
explained  by  the  respondents  (too  many  people,  groundwater  salinization  etc.).  
However, it is possible to analyse the positive emotional responses (feeling relaxed, happy 
and uplifted) against the background data, in order to see if peoples age, gender, place of 
residence,  where  they  grew  up  or  frequency  of  visits  affects  how  they  perceive  the 
landscape.   
 

4.4.2  Using the data from this study, none of these demographic factors were found to have a 
noticeable effect.  For example, between 83%-91% of respondents felt happy, regardless of 

PREPARED BY FIONA FYFE www.fionafyfe.co.uk

29

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: RESULTS      JULY 2011  

whether  they  visited  Exmoor  every  day  (ie.  they  live  there),  more  than  once  a  month, 
more than once a year, once every few years or only visit.  It was noticeable that a lower 
proportion  of  under  16  year-olds  felt  uplifted  but  this  could  well  have  been  due  to 
unfamiliarity with the term, as they expressed other positive emotions.   
 

4.4.3  As  the  demographic  factors  did  not  appear  to  affect  perception  of  landscape, 
environmental  factors  (weather  and  season)  were  tested.    Apart  from  the  predictable 
result that people felt slightly less happy when it was raining, neither weather nor season 
had a noticeable influence on whether people felt happy, relaxed or uplifted. 
 

4.4.4  Yet figs. 15-18 show variations in the emotional responses of respondents to the various 
landscape types.  If these responses cannot be explained by demographic or environmental 
factors  then  it  suggests  that  the  variations  in  emotional  response  are  a  result  of  the 
different  landscape  types  and  the  combination  of  elements  and  qualities  within  those 
landscapes.    This  would  support  the  findings  of  the  Research  Box  et  al.  (2009)  report, 
which identified certain landscape features (e.g. rivers and streams, coast, mountains and 
hills, moorland, field systems, villages) as being particularly highly valued for the cultural 
services  they  provide,  and    presumably    for  the  positive  emotional  response  they 
evoke.  Other landscape qualities such as openness or enclosure were also found to evoke 
different  reactions.      Different  landscape  types  have  different  combinations  of  these 
elements and qualities e.g. field systems in farmland landscape types; rivers and enclosure 
in valley landscape types and moorland and openness in upland moorland landscape types.  
Some  landscape  types  have  combinations  of  these  elements-  for  example  the  Coastal 
Heaths  (Great  Hangman  Hill)  have  both  moorland  and  coast,  with  strong  qualities  of 
openness,  wildness  and  exposure.      It  is  likely  that  the  variations  in  responses  between 
similar  types  of  landscape  e.g  High  Wooded  Coastal  Combes  (Watersmeet  survey  site) 
and Incised Wooded Valleys (Tarr Steps survey site) could be at least partially explained 
by  subtle  differences  in  the  combination  of  these  landscape  elements  and  qualities.  
Similarly the differences in responses between the Open Moorland (Brendon Common) 
and Coastal Heaths (Great Hangman Hill) may also be due to the presence of the sea and 
the dramatic cliffs and shoreline. 
 
Interesting  and  valuable  as  these  findings  are,  they  should  be  treated  with  a  note  of 
caution,  as  a  recent  publication  by  DEFRA  (2011)  highlights  research  suggesting  that 
ethnicity  and  socio-environmental  factors  also  affect  peoples  perception  of  upland 
landscapes,  and  data  on  these  factors  was  not  recorded  for  the  Exmoor  Landscape 
Perceptions Study.  Also, there is an element of self-selection within the sample, as people 
who do not like Exmoor (or how it makes them feel) are unlikely to chose to visit. 
 

4.4.5 

4.4.6  The survey undertaken of members of the Exmoor Society in 2004 and published in the 
Moorlands  at  a  Crossroads  report  indicated  a  marked  preference  for  moorland  as  the  
landscape  element  most  special  to  their  appreciation  of  Exmoor  (77%)  followed  by  the 
coast  (30%),  woodland  and  rivers  (both  23%)  and  farmland  (9%)  (see  section  2.3.2). 
Although the Exmoor Landscape Perceptions Study did not ask exactly the same question, it 
is interesting to note that moorland survey sites did not always score more highly in terms

of  scenic  beauty  than  other  types  of  landscape  (fig.  14),  and  nor  did  they  produce 
consistently higher positive emotional responses than other landscape types (figs. 15-17).   
 

4.4.7  But perhaps the greatest divergence from the results of the Exmoor Society survey is the 
appreciation  of  farmland  sites.    Farmland  was  ranked  very  low  in  the  Exmoor  Society 
survey, with only 9% of respondents considering it to be most special to their appreciation 
of  Exmoor.    Yet  the  Exmoor  Landscape  Perception  Study  has  demonstrated  the  positive 
responses which farmland landscapes can generate, in terms of both emotional response 
(feeling happy, relaxed and uplifted) and verbal description.

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS      JULY 2011  

5.0  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

5.1  General Conclusions 

 

 

5.1.1  The  overwhelming  conclusion  of  this  study  is  the  publics  appreciation  of  ALL  types  of 
landscape within Exmoor National Park, reflected in the words used to describe different 
landscapes, and in the positive emotional responses that those landscapes evoke.   
 

5.1.2  Nevertheless, people do perceive differences between the different landscape types, and 
these differences are expressed through the wide variety of words used to describe those 
landscapes  (262  different  adjectives),  and  peoples  emotional  responses  to  them  (144 
different emotions).   However, these differences are not apparent in the most frequently-
used words, which tend to be generic and positive terms such as  beautiful, peaceful and 
happy which were used throughout the National Park. 
 

5.1.3  Demographic  factors  (age,  gender,  place  of  residence)  and  environmental  factors 
(weather,  season)  do  not  appear  to  affect  how  people  respond  emotionally  to  different 
landscape  types,  although  data  on  ethnicity  and  socio-economic  status  (which  may 
influence peoples responses to landscape) were not collected for this study.   From this 
study,  therefore,  it  appears  that  it  is  the  different  combinations  of  landscape  elements 
(rivers, coast, moorland, field patterns etc) and landscape qualities (openness, enclosure, 
wildness)  which  create  different  emotional  responses  in  people.    This  endorses  the 
Research  Box  et  al.  (2009)  findings  on  the  values  attributed  to  different  landscape 
elements and qualities. 
 

5.1.4  A related observation is that 85% of respondents grew up in the countryside or a town/ 
suburb, with only 15% growing up in a city.  If this is a fair sample it suggests that where 
people live as a child influences their choice of where to visit as an adult.  However, those 
who  grew  up  in  a  city  did  not  have  noticeably  less  positive  responses  to  the  Exmoor 
landscape than those who grew up in the countryside/ town/ suburb. 
 

5.1.5  Data collected by this study confirms the emotional benefits of Exmoor (and presumably 

other National Parks) to individuals, and  collectively  to society as a whole.   
 

5.1.6  Exmoors landscape provides a wide variety of cultural services, although comparison of 
this study with previous research undertaken by Research Box et al. (2009) suggests that 
Exmoor provides slightly different cultural services for residents and visitors, with a sense 
of place/ being at home and spiritual values being ranked more highly by residents and 
relaxation/  tranquillity/  peace  and  quiet  being  more  highly  ranked  by  visitors.    Both 
studies  found  that  learning  and  education  and  understanding  the  past  were  ranked 
relatively low. 
 

5.1.7  A  relatively  low  proportion  of  respondents  had  noticed  positive  or  negative  changes 
within the landscape, but of those that had, the greatest number were residents and the 
smallest number were occasional visitors.  The changes which people had noticed covered 
a variety of topics but were rarely repeated across different survey sites.  When people

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS      JULY 2011  

were asked what changes they would like to see, the majority referred to improved visitor 
facilities  (benches,  bins  etc),  with  some  referring  to  land  management  (fewer  conifer 
plantations;  increased  area  of  heather  moorland)  and  others  suggesting  various  access 
improvements. 
 

5.1.8  A  larger  proportion  of  respondents  had  a  favourite  view  and/  or  a  favourite  series  of 
views within the National Park.  The favourite viewpoint was Dunkery, followed by Valley 
of Rocks, Watersmeet and Tarr Steps.  The favourite three routes were coastal (the A39, 
the Coast Path and Woody Bay- Hunters Inn).  Many different favourite views and routes 
were  recorded,  located  throughout  the  National  Park  and  including  main  roads,  minor 
roads  and  sites  only  accessible  by  footpath.    Reasons  for  preference  often  included 
references to landscape- either the combination of elements within it, or other qualities 
such as a sense of space or the distance or contrast within a view.   
 

5.1.9  The  Exmoor  Landscape  Perceptions  Study  has  provided  statistical  evidence  for  subjective 
responses  which  can  easily  be  taken  for  granted,  such  as  peoples  appreciation  of 
Exmoors  variety  and  scenic  beauty,  and  the  high  levels  of  tranquillity  achieved  at  many 
locations  throughout  the  National  Park.  The  results  of  the  study  demonstrate  that  the 
statutory purposes of the National Park are being successfully fulfilled, and that Exmoors 
special  qualities  are  being  retained.    The  study  therefore  endorses  the  effectiveness  of 
current management and demonstrates the importance of continued good management of 
all parts of the National Park in the future.   
 

5.1.10  Clearly, the ways in which people perceive and value landscapes are extremely complex 
and cannot be comprehensively addressed by a single study.  Nevertheless, it is hoped that 
the results of this study will add a further piece to the jigsaw.  Despite the complexity of 
the  subject,  a  number  of  clear  conclusions  are  apparent  which  may  influence  future 
management of the National Park. This leads on to the final question to be addressed by 
the study: 
 

5.2  How should peoples perception of landscapes affect management policies and 

strategies? 
 

5.2.1  The  extremely  positive  responses  by  the  public  to  the  Exmoor  landscape  indicate  that 
current  management  by  farmers,  foresters  and  landowners,  supported  by  the  National 
Park Authority and others is very effective.  The following comments are suggestions only, 
intended to stimulate discussion amongst those preparing the forthcoming review of the 
Exmoor National Park Management Plan.   
 

5.2.2  The  variety  of  landscape  character  within  the  National  Park  is  fundamental  to  peoples 
appreciation  of  it.  Farmland,  moorland  and  valleys/  woodland  create  equally  positive 
responses.  It is therefore important that the unique combination of landscape elements 
and qualities within each landscape type are retained and enhanced, in line with current 
policy.

EXMOOR LANDSCAPE PERCEPTIONS STUDY: CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS      JULY 2011  

5.2.3 

It  was  apparent  during  the  selection  of  survey  sites  that  farmland  was  relatively 
inaccessible compared to moorland and woodland, with far fewer footpaths or places of 
service  provision.    Given  peoples  positive  responses  to  farmland  landscapes,  it  may  be 
beneficial  to  increase  levels  of  access  to  these  areas,  and  to  consider  the  provision  of 
facilities (footpaths, toilets etc) to encourage visitors to farmland areas, possibly reducing 
the  pressure  at  other  honeypot  sites.    Of  course  any  such  schemes  would  need  to  be 
undertaken with all due sensitivity to the concerns of farmers, particularly regarding the 
wellbeing  of  livestock.    Results  from  farmland  survey  sites  suggest  that  the  challenge  of 
accommodating modern agricultural practices within the historic landscape framework is 
being  achieved,  although  the  associated  challenge  of  funding  farm  conservation  projects 
(such as hedgebank repair) outside designated SSSI areas remains. 
 

5.2.4  All the cultural services provided by the Exmoor landscape need to be encouraged, with 
relevant projects instigated and/or supported through the National Park Management Plan 
where  possible.    Of  particular  importance  is  the  encouragement  of  projects  which 
emphasise learning/ education or understanding of the past.   
 

5.2.5  The Exmoor landscape is clearly of enormous value to peoples emotional well-being, as 
well as their physical health.  Exmoor (along with other National Parks) has a role to play 
in providing society with these benefits.  It is therefore important that visitors continue to 
be encouraged and welcomed to Exmoor, and that the National Park continues to reach 
out to attract as wide a range of visitors as possible, thereby contributing to long-term 
benefits to society.   The sample for this survey contained relatively few 16-24 year olds, 
and if this pattern is representative, then new methods of communication to attract this 
age group should be explored.  There are many opportunities for using technology-based 
media to reach out to young adults, and those already undertaken by the National Park 
such as its Twitter feed (currently with 500 followers) and its new image-rich and dynamic 
website  should  be  encouraged.      The  National  Park  Authoritys  plans  for  an  Exmoor 
National  Park  presence  on  Facebook  and  for  a  mobile  phone  app  should  also  be 
supported.    In  addition,  adventurous  recreation  (providing  it  fits  with  National  Park 
purposes  and  special  qualities)  should  continue  to  be  promoted  through  the  Active 
Exmoor  brand,  and  a  broadening  of  the  range  of  National  Park  visitors  through  the 
Mosaic scheme should also be supported.  Provision of low-cost accommodation such as 
hostels and camping barns, and good public transport, should also facilitate visits by young 
people. 
 

5.2.6  Finally,  some  small-scale  improvements  which  have  been  pointed  out  by  a  number  of 
respondents (e.g provision of dog bins at Tarr Steps and the visual improvement of the 
fence at Watersmeet) would improve the visitor experience at these sites.  The new Tall 
Trees Trail and easy-access paths at Nutcombe Bottom received very positive comments, 
suggesting similar access schemes would be well-received in other parts of the National 
Park.
