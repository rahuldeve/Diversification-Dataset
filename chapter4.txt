Greenhouse Gases

CHAPTER 4

Why some gases are greenhouse gases, but
most aren’t, and some are stronger than others

About Gases
The layer model is what is called an idealization of the real world. It has the essential ingredient of the greenhouse effect, but it is missing numerous things that are important in the real
atmosphere. Starting from the Layer Model, the next few chapters add things one at a time,
assembling the rest of the ingredients that control the temperature of the real Earth. The first
task is to understand how real gases interact with infrared (IR) light in the real atmosphere.
Let us begin by defining different ways of describing the amounts of gases in the atmosphere. The word concentration means the number of molecules within some volume. The
difficulty this raises for gases in the atmosphere is that the concentration, defined in this way,
changes as the gas expands or contracts. It is often more convenient to talk about proportions of
gases; for example, oxygen is about 20% of the molecules of gas in the atmosphere, and nitrogen is almost 80%. The proportion of CO2 is currently 0.039%. We can express that in a more
mnemonic way by saying 390 parts per million, or ppm. This number is called a mixing ratio.
A gas exerts pressure, a pushing force, on itself or on the surface of anything in contact
with it. The force comes from deflected momentum of gas molecules bouncing off the surface.
The pressure of a mixture of gases can be taken apart into what are called partial pressures
arising from each type of molecule in the gas, which add up to the total pressure. The partial
pressure of CO2 , for example, is written as pCO2 .
One might expect heavier gases to contribute disproportionately to the pressure because
they seem like they would hit the walls harder. It works out, however, that heavier gas molecules
are moving more slowly than the light ones are, just enough so that the pushing force, proportional to the mass times the velocity, is the same on average with every type of molecule
regardless of how heavy it is. It is as if a bunch of ping-pong balls and bowling balls rolled
against the wall all pushed equally on the wall. They are equal because you have to roll the
bowling balls more slowly. At a given temperature, each molecule has the same amount of
energy on average invested in motion, what is called kinetic energy. A heavy molecule will
move more slowly with its allotment of kinetic energy.

A gas pressure, in units of microatmospheres (μatm), is numerically nearly equal
to its mixing ratio in parts per million (ppm).

The bottom line is that the partial pressure from a gas is more or less proportional to the
mixing ratio, the numerical proportion of the gas. If you think in pressure units of atmospheres,
the actual numbers are the same for the partial pressure and the mixing ratio. For CO2 , for
example, the mixing ratio is currently about 390 ppm, and its pCO2 is about 390 μatm.

CHAPTER 4

Greenhouse Gases

Gases, Vibrations, and Light
Most of the mass of an atom is in its nucleus, which resembles conceptually a massive sun at the
center of a solar system. Two nuclei of two different atoms always repel each other because of
their positive charges. Electrons float in ghostly quantum mechanical probability clouds, called
orbitals, around the nucleus. For some combinations of atoms, the electrons fall into orbitals that
are shared between the two nuclei. These electrons are the glue that holds together a chemical
bond between the atoms.
A chemical bond is like a spring in that the two nuclei on either end of the bond have
some freedom to move closer or farther apart. There is an optimum, lowest-energy distance for
the nuclei to be from each other. If they are any closer, the positive nuclei will start to repel
each other. Farther from each other, you get less energy gain from sharing the electrons. A
bond vibrates when the distance between the nuclei oscillates between the nuclei being too close
together, then too far apart. This is called a stretching vibration.
An atom may participate in more than one chemical bond. The bonds, and extra electrons
that the central atom holds on to, arrange themselves around the atom to find their positions and
angles of least energy. Here again there is some flexibility in the angle of the bond, which leads
to a bending vibration.

Chemical bonds vibrate at particular frequencies.

Molecular vibrations in gas molecules are like vibrations of a piano string in that they
tend to be at specific “ringing” frequencies. For weights and springs, the vibrational frequencies
depend on two things: the mass of the weights and the springiness of the spring holding them
together. Imagine the weights moving together, nearing the optimal distance but with enough
momentum to carry them closer than they would like to be, continuing the oscillation. Heavier
weights would have enough inertia to keep moving closer for a longer time than would a lighter
pair of weights, so the frequency of the vibration will be slower with heavy weights. If the
spring is very stiff, it will reverse the velocity of a vibration more quickly, and the frequency
of the oscillation will be higher. Vibrations in chemical bonds depend on the mass of the nuclei
and on the energy penalty for stretching or bending the bond, which determines the springiness
of the chemical bond.
Most forms of liquid and solid molecules are not so “choosy” about frequency of IR light
that they can absorb or emit, because the molecules interact with each other so much that more
or less all frequencies of IR light can be absorbed and emitted. Liquids and solids are pretty
good blackbodies, in other words. Gases however only absorb and emit specific frequencies of
IR light, meaning that they are generally not very good blackbodies.
In fact, most of the gases in the atmosphere do not absorb or emit IR light at all, because
vibrations in their bonds do not create an imbalance in the electrical field. Both O2 and N2 , the
most abundant gases in the atmosphere, are symmetric molecules, made of two identical atoms
whose electric fields just cancel each other out. Neither atom can hold the electrons any more
tightly than the other, so there is no difference between the electrical field on one side of the
molecule versus the other. The symmetry is unbroken when you stretch or compress the bond.
Symmetrical molecules with only two atoms are never greenhouse gases.

To create or absorb infrared light, the molecule must be electrically lopsided,
at least in passing.

Gases, Vibrations, and Light 31

If the symmetry is broken by having different types of atoms on each side, like carbon
monoxide (CO) or nitrogen oxide (NO), the molecules begin to have some greenhouse properties.
Both these types of molecules are very reactive and are not found in enough abundance in the
atmosphere to lead to much greenhouse effect, but these are good stepping-stone molecules
to think about before moving to more complicated atoms like CO2 . Because the atoms have
different charges in their nuclei, their chemistry is different, including how hard they pull on
those electrons in their shared chemical bond. One side of the molecule will probably have a
slight positive charge, and the other will be slightly negative. This charge imbalance is called a
dipole moment. When the bond vibrates, it changes the steepness of the transition from positive
to negative, which drives the electric field. Changing the electric field is how greenhouse gases
interact with IR light. One could even oscillate the electric field by simply rotating the molecule.
Molecules with three or more atoms must have more than one chemical bond because a
single bond never connects more or less than two atoms. Imagine a set of three weights connected
in a line with two springs. When this contraption is jiggled, its bonds bend and stretch together,
as an integrated system, rather than each bond simply vibrating according to its own springiness
and weight, independent of the other. The whole thing rings like a bell, and like a complex bell
with a rich tone, there are multiple oscillations with different frequencies all going on at once.
The CO2 molecule is shaped in a straight line with carbon in the middle (Figure 4-1).
Oxygen tends to pull on electrons more tightly than carbon does, but the oxygen atom on one
side pulls the electrons just as tightly as the other oxygen on the other side. The molecule has
no permanent electrical field asymmetry (dipole moment). If all you do to the molecule is rotate
or stretch it, you have not broken the symmetry and you will have no effect on the electric field.

The CO2 bending vibration mode is the important one for climate.

However, two modes of vibration do generate an asymmetry in the electric field. The most
important CO2 vibrational mode for climate is the bending vibration. When the CO2 molecule
is bent, the oxygens, carrying slight negative charges, swing from one side of the molecule
to the other. The CO2 bending vibration absorbs and emits IR light; it is said to be infrared
active. The next section shows that the bending vibration absorbs IR light in the heart of Earth’s
emission spectrum, giving it strong leverage over Earth’s climate.

infrared light in the atmosphere.

The other vibrational mode is an asymmetric stretch, in which one bond is growing longer
as the other gets shorter, back and forth. There is less IR light of this frequency to absorb in the
atmosphere, so this mode has less impact on the Earth’s radiation budget than the bend does.
Water, H2 O, is a molecule that is bent in its lowest energy state (Figure 4-2). This is
because the oxygen has two pairs of electrons hanging off it, which push the hydrogens toward
the other side. Hydrogen atoms hold their electrons more loosely than oxygen atoms in chemical
bonds, so each hydrogen has a slightly positive charge (denoted in Figure 4-2 as the lowercase
Greek letter delta δ+). The oxygen end of the molecule has a slight negative charge. In contrast
to CO2 , water has a dipole moment built into its resting structure. Just as for the NO molecule,
rotating an H2 O molecule would oscillate the electric field and generate light. Because the
arrangement of the nuclei in H2 O is more complex than for NO, there are many modes of
vibration of the water molecule, including a symmetric stretch and a bend. These modes are
also IR active.
Water vapor is very electrically lopsided and can absorb and emit lots of
frequencies of infrared light.

How a Greenhouse Gas Interacts with Earthlight
Figure 4-3 shows blackbody spectra for temperatures ranging from 300 K, surface temperature
on a hot summer day, down to 220 K, which is about the coldest it gets in the atmosphere,
up near the troposphere at about 10-km altitude. There is also a jagged-looking curve moving
among the smooth ones. This is the intensity of light that an IR spectrometer would see if it
were in orbit over the Earth, looking down. Figure 4-3 is not data, but rather a model simulation from one of our online models that will be used in the Exercises. The Web address is
http://understandingtheforecast.org/projects/infrared_spectrum.html.
The spectrum of the light leaving the Earth going into space ranges between two different
blackbody spectra, a warmer one of about 270 K and a colder one from about 220 K. Parts of
the spectrum, most notably the broad, smooth part around 1,000 cycles/cm, follow the warmer
blackbody spectrum. There do not happen to be any gases in the atmosphere that absorb or emit
at this frequency, so this IR light is coming directly from the ground. Because the greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere are transparent to IR light in this band of frequencies, it is called the
atmospheric window.
The blackbody curves are like the temperature scale on a thermometer. You can
read the temperature of the infrared source as its intensity against this scale.

Figure 4-3 The solid line is a model-generated spectrum of the infrared light escaping
to space at the top of the atmosphere. For comparison, the broken lines are blackbody
spectra at different temperatures. If the Earth had no atmosphere, the outgoing spectrum
would look like a blackbody spectrum for 270 K, between the 260 K and 280 K spectra
shown. The atmospheric window is between about 900−1,000 cm−1 , where no gases
absorb or emit infrared light. CO2 , water vapor, ozone, and methane absorb infrared
light emitted from the ground and emit lower-intensity infrared from high altitudes, where
the air is colder than at the surface.

Other parts of the spectrum seem to follow the colder blackbody curve, like, for example,
at around 700 cycles/cm. This IR light is coming from greenhouse gases in the cold upper
atmosphere. The big dip in the spectrum at about 700 cycles/cm is from the bending vibration
of CO2 . IR light emission and absorption are a two-way street (Chapter 1), so CO2 absorbs
the intense, “warm” IR from the ground at this frequency and re-emits the same frequency
but at a lower intensity, because of its colder temperature (Figure 4-4). The atmosphere is
called optically thick in the CO2 bend frequency range and optically thin in the atmospheric
window.
The situation is analogous to standing on a pier and looking down into a pond of water.
If the water were very clear, you could see light coming from the bottom; you would see rocks
or old tires in the reflected light. If the water were murky, the light you would see would be
scattered light coming from perhaps just a few inches down into the water. The old tires would
be invisible, alas. The muddy lake is optically thick, so the light you see comes from near the top.
Figure 4-3 is constructed so that the area under a curve of a spectrum is proportional to the
total energy flux. You can eyeball the energy change as the area change. The areas of the pure
blackbody curves go up proportionally to the temperature raised to the fourth power because
of the Stefan-Boltzmann equation (Equation 2-1 in Chapter 2). The area trick works with the
jagged spectrum as well, representing the total energy loss of the planet to space. The effect of
an atmospheric absorption band is to take a bite out of the blackbody spectrum from the Earth’s
surface, decreasing the area and therefore decreasing the outgoing energy flux.

Methane absorbs IR light at around 1300 cycles/cm. Whereas the CO2 bending vibration
absorbs right at the peak of the blackbody spectrum of the Earth, methane absorbs in one of
the tails of the spectrum. In a competition between CO2 and methane for which is the stronger
greenhouse gas, the advantage here goes to CO2 . However, the next section introduces another
difference between the gases, which more than makes up for this, so that methane winds up as
the more powerful greenhouse gas of the two.

The Band Saturation Effect
Figure 4-5 shows the results from a series of model runs for different atmospheric CO2 concentrations, ranging from 0 to 1000 ppm. For reference, the atmosphere in 2010 contains about
390 ppm. With no CO2 , the atmosphere would be transparent to light of around 700 cycles/cm,
like it is in the atmospheric window. Adding the first 10 ppm of CO2 has a fairly noticeable
impact on the shape of the outgoing light spectrum, a sharp V-shaped slice out of the spectrum.
As the CO2 concentration is increased to 100 ppm, the center of the peak runs into the blackbody
curve from just a bit colder than 220 K, and it does not get any deeper as the CO2 concentration
is raised to 1000 ppm. This is the band saturation effect, the band referring to the range of
frequencies, and saturation meaning “used up,” all absorbed by the CO2 .
The reason for the saturation effect can be understood by analogy to the murky pond. As
the water gets murkier, it decreases the distance that a photon of light can travel before it is
absorbed. It does not take much mud in the water to obscure the old tire on the bottom, shifting
the visible depth from the bottom at say 3 m to maybe only 1 m. If the pond gets a lot murkier,
you will be able to see only a few centimeters down into the water. Making it murkier still will
limit the view to only 1 cm. The change in depth is getting less sensitive to the murkiness of

Figure 4-5 A demonstration of band saturation by CO2 . The addition of 10 ppm CO2 (upper
right) makes a huge difference to the outgoing infrared light spectrum relative to an atmosphere
that has no CO2 (upper left). Increasing CO2 to 100 and 1,000 ppm (lower panels) continues
to affect the spectrum, but you get less bang for your CO2 buck as CO2 concentration gets
higher.

the pond. In the same way, the changes in the temperature at which the atmosphere radiates to
space get smaller as the CO2 concentration of the air gets higher. You just see the coldest light
that you can get.

The center of an absorption band gets saturated as the gas gets more
concentrated, but the band gets fatter.

Each model run returns a value for the total IR energy flux leaving the location, called
Iout on the webpage and in units of W/m2 . These values are plotted in Figure 4-6. There is a
huge change in the outgoing energy flux between the runs with 0 ppm and 10 ppm because you
go from having no absorption to having a quite noticeable peak by adding a relatively small
amount of CO2 , just 10 ppm. Then, as you go up to 100 and 1,000 ppm, the change in energy
balance for each new molecule of CO2 , or each new ppm of CO2 , gets weaker.
The energy balance never becomes totally insensitive to further additions of CO2 , however.
More CO2 will always make it warmer, even up to the 70 atm of CO2 in the atmosphere of
Venus. In part, this is because as the CO2 concentration increases, the absorption peak in Figure
4-5 gets fatter, even if it cannot get much deeper. The middle of the absorption band is saturated,
but the edges are unsaturated.

Figure 4-6 Band saturation viewed in a different way from Figure 4-5. This is a
plot of the total energy flux carried by all infrared light, which is proportional to
the area under the spectrum curves in Figure 4-5. The outgoing energy flux is less
sensitive to CO2 when the CO2 concentration is high.

Even though the center of the CO2 bend frequency is saturated, more CO2 would
still affect Earth’s infrared energy output.

Given that the absorption bands are determined by vibrational frequencies of the molecule,
one might have expected that the edges of the bands would be quite sharp, as if CO2 absorbed
600 cycles/cm light completely and 599 cycles/cm light not at all. There are several reasons for
the fuzziness in the peaks. One is Doppler shifting. Like a train whistle, which sounds a higher
pitch as the train approaches, then lower after it passes and is moving away, the frequency of
light that the molecule “sees” depends on the speed of the molecule, toward or away from the
IR light source. If the molecule is moving away from the light source, it will absorb a slightly
longer wavelength of light.
The absorption bands are also “smeared out” when gas molecules interact with each other,
a phenomenon called pressure broadening. Liquids and solids are often fairly good blackbodies
because the molecules are so close to each other that they share energy. Even if the frequency
of the light is different from the frequency of the vibration, if the molecule is bathed in other
molecules, it may be possible to take up the “slop” and absorb the light anyway. Gas molecules
are generally too far apart from each other to act in this way, but they still do it to some extent,
more so if the pressure is higher. The CO2 on Venus, for example, is at such high pressure that
its absorption bands are extremely broadened.
Even if the saturation effect were complete, so that the peaks did not get fatter with
high concentration, adding more of the greenhouse gas would still increase the temperature of
the Earth, for the same reason that adding layers to the layer model also increases the ground
temperature. The layers in the layer model are by definition completely saturated in that they
absorb all the incoming IR, re-radiating at all frequencies. Adding a second pane of glass to the
layer model increases the ground temperature (this is the answer to one of the Exercises). On
Venus, even though the absorption of IR by the 70 atm of CO2 is completely saturated, adding
more CO2 would still increase its temperature further.

The Band Saturation Effect

The most dilute gases have awesome climate-changing power.

The bottom line is that the more abundant the greenhouse gas is, the less powerful each
molecule is in warming the climate. The band saturation for CO2 makes CO2 a less potent
greenhouse gas, per molecule, than it would be if we had no CO2 in the air to start with. Revisiting
the comparison between CO2 and methane as greenhouse gases, methane had a disadvantage
because its absorption band fell in the suburbs of the Earth-light spectrum, whereas CO2 fell
right downtown. Now, considering the band saturation effect, the advantage shifts to methane
because it has much lower concentration. You can see from the jagged edges of the methane
peak in Figure 4-3 that the methane absorption band is not saturated. For this reason, in spite
of the off-peak location of the methane absorption band, a molecule of methane added to the
atmosphere is about 40 times more powerful than is a molecule of CO2 .
For CO2 , the energy intensity Iout in units of W/m2 goes up proportionally to the log of
the CO2 concentration rather than proportionally to the CO2 concentration itself (which would
be linear in CO2 concentration). The logarithmic dependence means that you get about the same
Iout change in W/m2 from any doubling of the CO2 concentration. The radiative effect of going
from 10 to 20 ppm pCO2 is about the same as going from 100 to 200 ppm or 1,000 to 2,000 ppm.

Earth’s temperature rises in proportion to the number of CO2 doublings.

The sensitivities of climate models are often compared as the average equilibrium temperature change from doubling CO2 , a diagnostic that is called the climate sensitivity and
abbreviated as T2x . It takes several centuries for climate models to respond fully to a change
in CO2 , reaching the equilibrium. Most models have T2x between 2◦ and 5◦ C, and past climate
changes in the real world indicate that the real climate sensitivity of the Earth is probably in
this range (Chapter 11).
If you subjected the planet to higher CO2 concentrations for a few thousand years, there
might be changes to the huge ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica that could lead to even
higher global temperatures, so the Earth-system climate sensitivity is probably higher than the
model T2x values, which do not include such long-term effects. CO2 emission from fossil fuel
combustion will elevate the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of
years (Chapters 7 and 12), giving plenty of time for the full climate sensitivity of the Earth to
express itself.

The climate sensitivity to doubling CO2 is the first benchmark that climate
scientists compare between models.

One can use T2x to calculate the temperature change after a few centuries in response
to changing CO2 using an equation:

then
x = ln(y)
Equilibrium temperature changes from changes in CO2 , assuming various T2x values, are
shown in Figure 4-7.

The Greenhouse Effect of Gases
The basic idea of the greenhouse effect still works the way it did in the Layer Model (Chapter 3).
Figure 4-8 shows the outgoing IR spectrum of an Earth with no CO2 in the atmosphere. Let us
say that this outgoing energy flux is just in balance with incoming sunlight energy.
Now add 1,000 ppm CO2 to the atmosphere (middle panel), a huge change, so that the
effect in the spectra will be easy to see. The energy fluxes in these plots are proportional to the
area under the curves. The CO2 absorption band is like a bite taken out of the curve, decreasing
its area, therefore also decreasing the outgoing energy flux. The model reports that Iout decreases
from 249 W/m2 without CO2 to 223 W/m2 with CO2 .
The greenhouse effect drives the surface temperature to balance the energy budget. The
online model allows you to change the surface temperature, and by trial and error you can find
that warming the Earth up by 8.5◦ C brings Iout back up to about what it was before adding the
CO2 . In the bottom panel in Figure 4-8, the effect of the warming can be seen as a shift upward
where the arrows are pointing. Especially in the atmospheric window, the intensity of the IR
energy flux increases as the Earth warms. Visually, if the spectrum were a pile of ice cream and
you wanted to make a volcano, you could scoop out some ice cream from the summit, making the
hole where the CO2 absorption band is, and then spread it back in on the sides of the pile where
the atmospheric window is and other parts of the spectrum, so that in the end the overall size of
the ice cream pile is the same as it was initially. Adding the CO2 caused the planet to warm, intensifying the IR energy flux, especially in the atmospheric window, to balance its energy budget.

atmosphere above it respond by warming up 8.5 K in the bottom panel. The
total outgoing energy flux is restored to its initial value. The total energy flux
is proportional to the area under the curves. CO2 takes a bite out of the
top curve to generate the middle curve, but then the bottom curve bulks up
everywhere to compensate.

■ O2 and N2 are not greenhouse gases. All
molecules of three or more atoms, including
CO2 , water vapor, and methane, are greenhouse gases.

■ Band saturation: A greenhouse gas at relatively
high concentration like CO2 will be less effective, molecule per molecule, than a dilute gas
like methane.

STUDY QUESTIONS
1. Why don’t most of the gases in the Earth’s
atmosphere contribute to the greenhouse effect?
2. Does the band saturation effect prevent global
warming from CO2 ? If not, what effect does it
have?

3. Compare and contrast CO2 and CH4 as greenhouse gases. Which factor tends to make
CO2 stronger, and which factor tends to make
methane stronger? Which gas is stronger overall?

This is a historical account of the science and
the scientists who discovered global warming,
including my favorite, Svante Arrehnius, who
used the IR spectrum of moonlight, in 1896, to
predict that doubling CO2 would raise global
temperature by 3–6◦ C (whereas the modern

prediction is 2–5◦ C). This book includes a
good discussion of piecing together the band
saturation effect.

Exercises
Answer these questions using the on-line model at http://understandingtheforecast.org/
Projects/infrared_spectrum.html. The model takes CO2 concentration and other environmental
variables as input, and calculates the outgoing IR light spectrum to space, similarly to Figures
4-3, 4-5 and 4-7. The total energy flux from all IR light is listed as part of the model output and
was used to construct Figure 4-6.
1. Methane. Methane has a current concentration of 1.7 ppm in the atmosphere and its doubling
at a faster rate than is CO2 .
a) Would an additional 10 ppm of methane in the atmosphere have a larger or smaller impact
on the outgoing IR flux than an additional 10 ppm of CO2 at current concentrations?
b) Where in the spectrum does methane absorb? What concentration does it take to begin to
saturate the absorption in this band? Explain what you are looking at to judge when the gas
is saturated.

The Greenhouse Effect of Gases

c) Would a doubling of methane have as great an impact on the heat balance as a doubling of
CO2 ?
d) What is the ‘‘equivalent CO2 ’’ of doubling atmospheric methane? That is to say, how many
ppm of CO2 would lead to the same change in outgoing IR radiation energy flux as doubling
methane? What is the ratio of ppm CO2 change to ppm methane change?
2. CO2
a) Is the direct effect of increasing CO2 on the energy output at the top of the atmosphere
larger in high latitudes or in the tropics?
b) Set pCO2 to an absurdly high value of 10,000 ppm. You will see a spike in the CO2 absorption
band. What temperature is this light coming from? Where in the atmosphere do you think
this comes from?
Now turn on clouds and run the model again. Explain what you see. Why, at night, is it
warmer when there are clouds?
3. Water vapor. Our theory of climate presumes that an increase in the temperature at ground
level will lead to an increase in the outgoing IR energy flux at the top of the atmosphere.
a) How much extra outgoing IR would you get by raising the temperature of the ground by 5◦ C?
What effect does the ground temperature have on the shape of the outgoing IR spectrum
and why?
b) More water can evaporate into warm air than into cool air. By setting the model to hold the
water vapor at constant relative humidity rather than constant vapor pressure (the default),
calculate again the change in outgoing IR energy flux that accompanies a 5◦ C temperature
increase. Is it higher or lower? Does water vapor make the Earth more sensitive to CO2
increases or less sensitive?
c) Now see this effect in another way. Starting from a base case, record the total outgoing
IR flux. Now increase pCO2 to 550 ppm. The temperature in the model stays the same (it’s
just how the model is written), so the IR flux goes down. Now, using the constant vapor
pressure of water option, increase the temperature offset until you get the original IR flux
back again. What is the change in T required? Now repeat the calculation but at constant
relative humidity. Does the increase in CO2 drive a bigger or smaller temperature change?
