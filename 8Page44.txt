X-Class solar flares are among the most powerful, explosive events on the 
 
solar  surface.  They  can  cause  short-wave 
interference,  satellite 
malfunctions  and  can  even  cause  the  premature  re-entry  of  satellites  into  the 
atmosphere. 
 
The  table  above  lists  the  number  of  X-class  flares  detected  on  the  sun 
during the last sunspot cycle which lasted from 1996 to about 2008. The second 
column also gives the year from the start of the 11-year sunspot cycle in 1996. 
The  counts  are  listed  by  year  (rows)  and  by  month  (columns).  Study  this  table 
and answer the following questions to learn more about how common these flares 
are. 
 
Problem 1  For the years and months considered, is the distribution of months 
with flares a uniform distribution? Explain. 
 
Problem  2 
into  pre-maximum 
(1996,1997,1998,1999),  maximum 
(2000,2001,2002)  and  post-maximum 
(2003,2004,2005,2006). For each group, calculate A) The percentage of months 
with no flares; and B) The average number of weeks between flares. 
 
Problem 3   For each group, what is the median number of flares that occurs in 
the months that have flares? 
 
Problem 4   Taken as a whole, what is the average number of flares per month 
during the entire 11-year sunspot cycle? 
 
Problem  5    We  are  currently  in  Year-3  of  the  current  sunspot  cycle,  which 
began  in  2007.  About  how  many  X-class  flares  would  you  predict  for  this  year 
using the tabulated flares from the previous sunspot cycle as a guide, and what is 
the average number of weeks between these flares for this year?

 Problem 1  For the years and months considered, is the distribution of months with 
flares  a  uniform  distribution?  Explain.  Answer;  If  you  shaded  in  all  the  months  with 
flares  you  would  see  that  most  occur  between  1999-2002  so  the  distribution  is  not 
random, and is not uniform. 
 
Problem 2 - The sunspot cycle can be grouped into pre-maximum (1996,1997,1998, 
1999),  maximum  (2000,2001,2002)  and  post-maximum  (2003,2004,2005,2006).  For 
each group, calculate A) the percentage of months with no flares, and B) The average 
number of weeks between flares. Answer: A)   Pre-Maximum, N = 39 months so P = 
100%x39/48 = 81% . Maximum; N = 17 months so P = 100% x 17/36 = 47%; post-
maximum N= 48 months so P = 100% x 35/48 =  73%.  B)  pre-maximum N = 22 flares 
so T = 48 months/22 flares = 2.2 months.  Maximum:  N = 50 flares so T = 36 mo/50 = 
0.7 months; post-maximum: N = 50 flares so T = 48 mo/50 = 1.0 months. 
 
Problem 3   For each group, what is the median number of flares that occurs in the 
months  that  have  flares?  Answer:    Pre-maximum:    1,1,1,2,2,2,3,5,5      median  =  1.5  
Maximum:  1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,8 
  median  =  4;  post-maximum 
1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,6,6,7 median = 6 
 
Problem 4  Taken as a whole, what is the average number of flares per month during 
the entire 11-year sunspot cycle? Answer: There were 122 flares detected during the 
132 months of the sunspot cycle, so the average is 122 flares/132 months = 0.9 , 
which can be rounded to 1 flare/month.

Problem 5  We are in Year-3 of the current sunspot cycle, which began in 2007. 
About how many X-class flares would you predict for this year using the tabulated 
flares from the previous sunspot cycle as a guide, and what is the average number of 
weeks between these flares for this year? Answer: From the table we find for Year 3 
that there were 14, X-class flares.  Since there are 12 months in a year, this means 
that the average time between flares is about 14/12 = 1.2 months.
