ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
Developmental activities such as construction, transportation and manufacturing not only
deplete the natural resources but also produce large amount of wastes that leads to pollution
of air, water, soil, and oceans; global warming and acid rains. Untreated or improperly
treated waste is a major cause of pollution of rivers and environmental degradation causing
ill health and loss of crop productivity. In this lesson you will study about the major causes
of pollution, their effects on our environment and the various measures that can be taken to
control such pollutions.

OBJECTIVES
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
•

define the terms pollution and pollutants;

•

list various kinds of pollution;

•

describe types of pollution, sources, harmful effects on human health and control
of air pollution, indoor air pollution, noise pollution;

•

describe water pollution, its causes and control;

•

describe thermal pollution;

•

describe soil pollution, its causes and control;

•

describe radiation pollution, sources and hazards.

10.1 POLLUTION AND POLLUTANTS
Human activities directly or indirectly affect the environment adversely. A stone crusher
adds a lot of suspended particulate matter and noise into the atmosphere. Automobiles
emit from their tail pipes oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon
monoxide and a complex mixture of unburnt hydrocarbons and black soot which pollute
the atmosphere. Domestic sewage and run off from agricultural fields, laden with pesticides
164

and fertilizers, pollute water bodies. Effluents from tanneries contain many harmful chemicals
and emit foul smell. These are only a few examples which show how human activities
pollute the environment. Pollution may be defined as addition of undesirable material into
the environment as a result of human activities. The agents which cause environmental
pollution are called pollutants. A pollutants may be defined as a physical, chemical or
biological substance unintentionally released into the environment which is directly or
indirectly harmful to humans and other living organisms.

10.2 TYPES OF POLLUTION
Pollution may be of the following types:
•

Air pollution

•

Noise pollution

•

Water pollution

•

Soil pollution

•

Thermal pollution

•

Radiation pollution

10.3 AIR POLLUTION
Air pollution is a result of industrial and certain domestic activity. An ever increasing use of
fossil fuels in power plants, industries, transportation, mining, construction of buildings,
stone quarries had led to air pollution. Air pollution may be defined as the presence of
any solid, liquid or gaseous substance including noise and radioactive radiation in the
atmosphere in such concentration that may be directly and indirectly injurious to humans
or other living organisms, plants, property or interferes with the normal environmental
processes. Air pollutants are of two types (1) suspended particulate matter, and (2) gaseous
pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO2), NOx etc. Some of the major air pollutants, their
sources and effects are given in table 10.1.

10.3.1 Particulate pollutants
Particulate matter suspended in air are dust and soot released from the industrial chimneys.
Their size ranges from 0.001 to 500 µm in diameter. Particles less than 10µm float and
move freely with the air current. Particles which are more than 10µm in diameter settle
down. Particles less than 0.02 µm form persisent aerosols. Major source of SPM (suspended
particulate matter) are vehicles, power plants, construction activities, oil refinery, railway
yard, market place, industries, etc.
• Fly ash
Fly ash is ejected mostly by thermal power plants as by products of coal burning operations.
Fly ash pollutes air and water and may cause heavy metal pollution in water bodies. Fly
ash affects vegetation as a result of its direct deposition on leaf surfaces or indirectly
through its deposition on soil. Fly ash is now being used for making bricks and as a land fill
material.
• Lead and other metals particles
Tetraethyl lead (TEL) is used as an anti-knock agent in petrol for smooth and easy running
of vehicles. The lead particles coming out from the exhaust pipes of vehicles is mixed with
air. If inhaled it produces injurious effects on kidney and liver and interferes with development
of red blood cells. Lead mixed with water and food can create cumulative poisoning. It
has long term effects on children as it lowers intelligence.
Oxides of iron, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, zinc and other metals have adverse
effect due to deposition of dust on plants during mining operations and metallurgical
processes. They create physiological, biochemical and developmental disorders in plants
and also contribute towards reproductive failure in plants.

petrol, diesel as fuel and release gaseous pollutants such as carbon dioxide, oxides of
nitrogen and sulphur dioxide along with particulate matter in the form of smoke. All of
these have harmful effects on plants and humans. Table 10.3 lists some of these pollutants,

10.3.3 Prevention and control of air pollution
(i) Indoor air pollution

Notes

Poor ventilation due to faulty design of buildings leads to pollution of the confined space.
Paints, carpets, furniture, etc. in rooms may give out volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Use of disinfectants, fumigants, etc. may release hazardous gases. In hospitals, pathogens
present in waste remain in the air in the form of spores. This can result in hospital acquired
infections and is an occupational health hazard. In congested areas, slums and rural areas
burning of firewood and biomass results in lot of smoke. Children and ladies exposed to
smoke may suffer from acute respiratory problems which include running nose, cough,
sore throat, lung infection, asthama, difficulty in breathing, noisy respiration and wheezing.
(ii) Prevention and control of indoor air pollution
Use of wood and dung cakes should be replaced by cleaner fuels such as biogas, kerosene
or electricity. But supply of electricity is limited. Similarly kerosene is also limited. Improved
stoves for looking like smokeless chullahs have high thermal efficiency and reduced emission
of pollutants including smoke. The house designs should incorporate a well ventilated
kitchen. Use of biogas and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) need to be encouraged.
Those species of trees such as baval (Acacia nilotica) which are least smoky should be
planted and used. Charcoal is a comparatively cleaner fuel. Indoor pollution due to decay
of exposed kitchen waste can be reduced by covering the waste properly. Segregation of
waste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor air pollution.
(iii) Prevention and control of industrial pollution
Industrial pollution can be greatly reduced by:
(a) use of cleaner fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) in power plants, fertilizer
plants etc. which is cheaper in addition to being environmentally friendly.
(b) employing environment friendly industrial processes so that emission of pollutants and
hazardous waste is minimized.
(c) installing devices which reduce release of pollutants. Devices like filters, electrostatic
precipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers, gravel bed filters or dry scrubbers are
described below:
(i) Filters – Filters remove particulate matter from the gas stream. The medium of a filter
may be made of fibrous materials like cloth, granular material like sand, a rigid material
like screen, or any mat like felt pad. Baghouse filtration system is the most common
one and is made of cotton or synthetic fibres ( for low temperatures) or glass cloth
fabrics (for higher temperature up to 290oC).
(ii) Electrostatic precipitators (ESP)- The emanating dust is charged with ions and the
ionized particulate matter is collected on an oppositely charged surface. The particles

168

Environmental Pollution
are removed from the collection surface by occasional shaking or by rapping the
surface. ESPs are used in boilers, furnaces, and many other units of thermal power
plants, cement factories, steel plants, etc.
(iii) Inertial collectors – It works on the principle that inertia of SPM in a gas is higher
than its solvent and as inertia is a function of the mass of the particulate matter this
device collects heavier particles more efficiently. ‘Cyclone’ is a common inertial collector
used in gas cleaning plants.

Contemporary
Environmental Issues

Notes

(iv) Scrubbers – Scrubbers are wet collectors. They remove aerosols from a stream of
gas either by collecting wet particles on a surface followed by their removal, or else
the particles are wetted by a scrubbing liquid. The particles get trapped as they travel
from supporting gaseous medium across the interface to the liquid scrubbing medium.
Gaseous pollutants can be removed by absorption in a liquid using a wet scrubber and
depends on the type of the gas to be removed e.g. for removal of sulphur dioxide alkaline
solution is needed as it dissolves sulphur dioxide. Gaseous pollutants may be absorbed on
an activated solid surface like silica gel, alumina, carbon, etc. Silica gel can remove water
vapour. Condensation allows the recovery of many by products in coal and petroleum
processing industries from their liquid effluents.
Apart from the use of above mentioned devices, other control measures are•

increasing the height of chimneys.

•

closing industries which pollute the environment.

•

shifting of polluting industries away from cities and heavily populated areas.

•

development and maintenance of green belt of adequate width.

(iv) Control of vehicular pollution
•

The emission standards for automobiles have been set which if followed will reduce
the pollution. Standards have been set for the durability of catalytic converters which
reduce vehicular emission.

•

In cities like Delhi, motor vehicles need to obtain Pollution Under Control (PUC)
certificate at regular intervals. This ensures that levels of pollutants emitted from vehicle
exhaust are not beyond the prescribed legal limits.

•

The price of diesel is much cheaper than petrol which promotes use of diesel. To
reduce emission of sulphurdioxide, sulphur content in diesel has been reduced to 0.05%.

•

Earlier lead in the form of tetraethyl lead was added in the petrol to raise octane level
for smooth running of engines. Addition of lead in petrol has been banned to prevent
emission of lead particles with the vehicular emission.

10.4 OZONE HOLE-CAUSES AND HARM DUE TO OZONE
DEPLETION
The stratosphere has an ozone layer which protects the earth’s surface from excessive
ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Chlorine from chemicals such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used for refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers,
cleaning solvents, aerosols (spray cans of perfumes, medicine, insecticide) cause damage
to ozone layer chlorine contained in the CFCs on reaching the ozone (O3) layer split the
ozone molecules to form oxygen (O2). Amount of ozone, thus gets reduced and cannot
prevent the entry of UV radiation. There has been a reduction of ozone umbrella or shield
over the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This is known as ozone hole. This permits passage
of UV radiation on earth’s atmosphere which causes sunburn, cataract in eyes leading to
blindness, skin cancer, reduced productivity of forests, etc. Under the “Montreal Protocol”
amended in 1990 it was decided to completely phase out CFCs to prevent damage of
ozone layer.

10.5 GLOBAL WARMING AND GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Atmospheric gases like carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour, and
chlorofluorocarbons are capable of trapping the out-going infrared radiation from the earth.
Infra-red radiations trapped by the earth’s surface cannot pass through these gases and to
increase thermal energy or heat in the atmosphere. Thus, the temperature of the global
atmosphere is increased. As this phenomenon of increase in temperature is observed in

170

green houses, in the botanical gardens these gases are known as green house gases and
the heating effect is known as green house effect. If greenhouse gases are not checked, by
the turn of the century the temperature may rise by 50C. This will melt the polar ice caps
and increase the sea level leading to coastal flooding, loss of coastal areas and ecosystems
like swamps and marshes, etc.

10.6 NOISE POLLUTION
Noise is one of the most pervasive pollutant. A musical clock may be nice to listen during
the day, but may be an irritant during sleep at night. Noise by definition is “sound without
value” or “any noise that is unwanted by the recipient”. Noise in industries such as stone
cutting and crushing, steel forgings , loudspeakers, shouting by hawkers selling their wares,
movement of heavy transport vehicles, railways and airports leads to irritation and an
increased blood pressure, loss of temper, decrease in work efficiency, loss of hearing
which may be first temporary but can become permanent in the noise stress continues. It is
therefore of utmost importance that excessive noise is controlled. Noise level is measured
in terms of decibels (dB). W.H.O. (World Health Organization) has prescribed optimum
noise level as 45 dB by day and 35 dB by night. Anything above 80 dB is hazardous. The
table10.4 gives the noise intensity in some of the common activities.

10.6.1 Sources of noise pollution
Noise pollution is a growing problem. All human activities contribute to noise pollution to
varying extent. Sources of noise pollution are many and may be located indoors or outdoors.
Indoor sources include noise produced by radio, television, generators, electric fans, air
coolers, air conditioners, different home appliances, and family conflict. Noise pollution is
more in cities due to a higher concentration of population and industries and activities such
as transportation. Noise like other pollutants is a by product of industrialization, urbanization
and modern civilization.

Notes

Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course
Outdoor sources of noise pollution include indiscriminate use of loudspeakers, industrial
activities, automobiles, rail traffic, aeroplanes and activities such as those at market place,
religious, social, and cultural functions, sports and political rallies. In rural areas farm
machines, pump sets are main sources of noise pollution. During festivals, marriage and
many other occasions, use of fire crackers contribute to noise pollution.
10.6.2 Effects of noise pollution
Noise pollution is highly annoying and irritating. Noise disturbs sleep, causes hypertension
(high blood pressure), emotional problems such as aggression, mental depression and
annoyance. Noise pollution adversely affects efficiency and performance of individuals.
10.6.3 Prevention and control of noise pollution
Following steps can be taken to control or minimize noise pollution•

Road traffic noise can be reduced by better designing and proper maintenance of
vehicles.

•

Noise abatement measures include creating noise mounds, noise attenuation walls and
well maintained roads and smooth surfacing of roads.

•

Retrofitting of locomotives, continuously welded rail track, use of electric locomotives
or deployment of quieter rolling stock will reduce noises emanating from trains.

•

Air traffic noise can be reduced by appropriate insulation and introduction of noise
regulations for take off and landing of aircrafts at the airport.

•

Industrial noises can be reduced by sound proofing equipment like generators and
areas producing lot of noise.

•

Power tools, very loud music and land movers, public functions using loudspeakers,
etc should not be permitted at night. Use of horns, alarms, refrigeration units, etc. is to
be restricted. Use of fire crackers which are noisy and cause air pollution should be
restricted.

•

A green belt of trees is an efficient noise absorber.

10.7 WATER POLLUTION
Addition or presence of undesirable substances in water is called water pollution.
Water pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems. Water pollution is
caused by a variety of human activities such as industrial, agricultural and domestic.
Agricultural run off laden with excess fertilizers and pesticides, industrial effluents with
toxic substances and sewage water with human and animal wastes pollute our water
thoroughly. Natural sources of pollution of water are soil erosion, leaching of minerals
from rocks and decaying of organic matter. Rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, estuaries and
ground water sources may be polluted by point or non-point sources. When pollutants are
discharged from a specific location such as a drain pipe carrying industrial effluents
discharged directly into a water body it represents point source pollution. In contrast
non-point sources include discharge of pollutants from diffused sources or from a larger
area such as run off from agricultural fields, grazing lands, construction sites, abandoned
mines and pits, roads and streets.

Notes

10.7.1 Sources of water pollution
Water pollution is the major source of water born diseases and other health problems.
Sediments brought by runoff water from agricultural fields and discharge of untreated or
partially treated sewage and industrial effluents, disposal of fly ash or solid waste into or
close to a water body cause severe problems of water pollution. Increased turbidity of
water because of sediments reduces penetration of light in water that reduces photosynthesis
by aquatic plants.
(i) Pollution due to pesticides and inorganic chemicals
•

Pesticides like DDT and others used in agriculture may contaminate water bodies.
Aquatic organisms take up pesticides from water get into the food chain (aquatic in
this case) and move up the food chain. At higher trophic level they get concentrated
and may reach the upper end of the food chain.

•

Metals like lead, zinc, arsenic, copper, mercury and cadmium in industrial waste waters
adversely affect humans and other animals. Arsenic pollution of ground water has
been reported from West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Western U.P. Consumption of such
arsenic polluted water leads to accumulation of arsenic in the body parts like blood,
nails and hairs causing skin lesions, rough skin, dry and thickening of skin and ultimately
skin cancer.

•

Pollution of water bodies by mercury causes Minamata disease in humans and
dropsy in fishes. Lead causes displexia, cadmium poisoning causes Itai – Itai disease
etc.

•

Oil pollution of sea occurs from leakage from ships, oil tankers, rigs and pipelines.
Accidents of oil tankers spill large quantity of oil in seas which kills marine birds and
adversely affects other marine life and beaches.

(ii) Thermal pollution
Power plants- thermal and nuclear, chemical and other industries use lot of water (about
30 % of all abstracted water) for cooling purposes and the used hot water is discharged
into rivers, streams or oceans. The waste heat from the boilers and heating processes
increases the temperature of the cooling water. Discharge of hot water may increase the
temperature of the receiving water by 10 to 15 °C above the ambient water temperature.
This is thermal pollution. Increase in water temperature decreases dissolved oxygen in
water which adversely affects aquatic life. Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the temperature
of water bodies remain steady and does not change very much. Accordingly, aquatic
organisms are adopted to a uniform steady temperature of environment and any fluctuation
in water temperature severely affects aquatic plants and animals. Hence discharge of hot
water from power plants adversely affects aquatic organisms. Aquatic plants and animals
in the warm tropical water live dangerously close to their upper limit of temperature,
particularly during the warm summer months. It requires only a slight deviation from this
limit to cause a thermal stress to these organisms.
Discharge of hot water in water body affects feeding in fishes, increases their metabolism
and affects their growth. Their swimming efficiency declines. Running away from predators
or chasing prey becomes difficult. Their resistance to diseases and parasites decreases.
Due to thermal pollution biological diversity is reduced. One of the best methods of reducing
thermal pollution is to store the hot water in cooling ponds, allow the water to cool before
releasing into any receiving water body
10.7.2 Ground water pollution
Lot of people around the world depend on ground water for drinking, domestic, industrial
and agricultural uses. Generally groundwater is a clean source of water. However, human
activities such as improper sewage disposal, dumping of farm yard manures and agricultural
chemicals, industrial effluents are causing pollution of ground water.

10.7.3 Eutrophication

MODULE - 4
Contemporary
Environmental Issues

• ‘Eu’ maens well or healthy and ‘trophy’ means nutrition. The enrichment of water bodies
with nutrients causes entrophication of the water body.
Discharge of domestic waste, agricultural surface runoff, land drainage and industrial effluents
in a water body leads to rapid nutrients enrichment in a water body. The excessive nutrient
enrichment in a water body encourages the growth of algae duckweed, water hyacinth,
phytoplankton and other aquatic plants.The biological demand for oxygen (BOD) increases
with the increase in aquatic organisms. As more plants grow and die, the dead and decaying
plants and organic matter acted upon by heterotrophic prtozoans and bacteria, deplete the
water of dissolved oxygen (DO). Decrease in DO result in sudden death of large population
of fish and other aquatic organisms including plants, releasing offensive smell and makes
the water unfit for human use. The sudden and explosive growth of phytoplankton and
algae impart green colour to the water is known as water bloom, or “algal blooms”. These
phytoplankton release toxic substances in water that causes sudden death of large population
of fishes. This phenomenon of nutrient enrichment of a water body is called eutrophication.
Human activities are mainly responsible for the eutrophication of a growing number of
lakes and water bodies in the country

Notes

10.7.4 Methods for control of water pollution and water recycling
Control water pollution
Waste water from domestic or industrial sources or from garbage dumps is generally
known as sewage. It may also contain rain water and surface runoff. The sewage water
can be treated to make it safe for disposal into water bodies like rivers, lakes etc. The
treatment involves three stages: primary, secondary and tertiary. This includes 1.
sedimentation, 2. coagulation/flocculation, 3.filtration, 4.disinfection, 5.softening and
6.aeration. The first four steps are of primary treatment. The first three steps are involved
in primary treatment remove suspended particulate matter. Secondary treatment removes
organic solids, left out after primary treatment, through their microbial decomposition.
Effluents after secondary treatment may be clean but contain large amounts of nitrogen, in
form of ammonia, nitrates and phosphorous which can cause problem of eutrophication
upon their discharge into a receiving water body such as river, lake or pond. The tertiary
treatment is meant to remove nutrients, disinfect for removing pathogenic bacteria, and
aeration removes hydrogen sulphide and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and make
water healthy and fit for aquatic organisms. This treatment of waste water or sewage is
carried out in effluent treatment plants especially built for this purpose. The residue obtained
from primary treatment one known as sludge.
10.7.5 Water recycling
With increasing population the requirement for water is increasing rapidly. However, the
availability of water is limited but an ever increasing water withdrawal from different sources
175

MODULE - 4
Contemporary
Environmental Issues

Notes

Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course
such as rivers, lakes and ground water is depleting these sources and deteriorating their
water quality. Therefore, it is essential to utilize the available water with maximum economy.
This involves recycling of waste water for certain uses with or without treatment. Recycling
refers to the use of waste-water by the original user prior to the discharge either to a
treatment system or to a receiving water body. Thus the waste water is recovered and
repetitively recycled with or without treatment by the same user.
10.7.6. Control of water pollution
The following measures can be adopted to control water pollution:
(a) The water requirement should be minimized by altering the techniques involved.
(b) Water should be reused with or without treatment.
(c) Recycling of water after treatment should be practiced to the maximum extent possible.
(d) The quantity of waste water discharge should be minimized.

10.8 SOIL POLLUTION
Addition of substances which adversely affect the quality of soil or its fertility is known as
soil pollution. Generally polluted water also pollute soil. Solid waste is a mixture of plastics,
cloth, glass, metal and organic matter, sewage, sewage sludge, building debris, generated
from households, commercial and industries establishments add to soil pollution. Fly ash,
iron and steel slag, medical and industrial wastes disposed on land are important sources
of soil pollution. In addition, fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural use which reach soil
as run-off and land filling by municipal waste are growing cause of soil pollution. Acid rain
and dry deposition of pollutants on land surface also contribute to soil pollution.

Notes

Fig. 10.3: A pile of plastic bags along with leftovers- a cow eating them
10.8.1 Sources of soil pollution
Plastic bags – Plastic bags made from low density polyethylene (LDPE), is virtually
indestructible, create colossal environmental hazard. The discarded bags block drains and
sewage systems. Leftover food, vegetable waste etc. on which cows and dogs feed may
die due to the choking by plastic bags. Plastic is non biodegradable and burning of plastic
in garbage dumps release highly toxic and poisonous gases like carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, phosgene, dioxine and other poisonous chlorinated compounds.
Industrial sources – It includes fly ash, chemical residues, metallic and nuclear wastes.
Large number of industrial chemicals, dyes, acids, etc. find their way into the soil and are
known to create many health hazards including cancer.
Agricultural sources – Agricultural chemicals especially fertilizers and pesticides pollute
the soil. Fertilizers in the run off water from these fields can cause eutrophication in water
bodies. Pesticides are highly toxic chemicals which affect humans and other animals adversely
causing respiratory problems, cancer and death.
10.8.2 Control of soil pollution
Indiscriminate disposal of solid waste should be avoided.

To control soil pollution, it is essential to stop the use of plastic bags and instead use bags
of degradable materials like paper and cloth. Sewage should be treated properly before
using as fertilizer and as landfills. The organic matter from domestic, agricultural and other
waste should be segregated and subjected to vermicomposting which generates useful
manure as a by product. The industrial wastes prior to disposal should be properly treated
for removing hazardous materials. Biomedical waste should be separately collected and
incinerated in proper incinerators.

10.9 RADIATION POLLUTION: SOURCES AND HAZARDS
Radiation pollution is the increase in over the natural background radiation. There are
many sources of radiation pollution such as nuclear wastes from nuclear power plants,
mining and processing of nuclear material etc. The worse case of nuclear pollution was the
cherndoyl disaster in Russia occured in 1986 but the effects still longer today.
10.9.1 Radiation
Radiation is a form of energy travelling through space. The radiation emanating from the
decay of radioactive nuclides are a major sources of radiation pollution. Radiations can be
categorized into two groups namely the non-ionizing radiations and the ionizing radiations.
Non-ionizing radiations are constituted by the electromagnetic waves at the longer
wavelength of the spectrum ranging from near infra-red rays to radio waves. These waves
have energies enough to excite the atoms and molecules of the medium through which they
pass, causing them to vibrate faster but not strong enough to ionize them. In a microwave
oven the radiation causes water molecules in the cooking medium to vibrate faster and
thus raising its temperature.
Ionizing radiations cause ionization of atoms and molecules of the medium through which
they pass. Electromagnetic radiations such as short wavelength ultra violet radiations (UV),
178

Environmental Pollution
X-rays and gamma rays and energetic particles produced in nuclear processes, electrically
charged particles like alpha and beta particles produced in radioactive decay and neutrons
produced in nuclear fission, are highly damaging to living organisms. Electrically charged
particles produced in the nuclear processes can have sufficient energy to knock electrons
out of the atoms or molecules of the medium, thereby producing ions. The ions produced
in water molecules, for example, can induce reactions that can break bonds in proteins
and other important molecules. An example of this would be when a gamma ray passes
through a cell, the water molecules near the DNA might be ionized and the ions might react
with the DNA causing it to break. They can also cause chemical changes by breaking the
chemical bonds, which can damage living tissues. The ionizing radiations cause damage to
biological systems and are, therefore, pollutants.

10.9.2 Radiation damage
The biological damage resulting from ionizing radiations is generally termed as radiation
damage. Large amounts of radiation can kill cells that can dramatically affect the exposed
organism as well as possibly its offspring. Affected cells can mutate and result in cancer. A
large enough dose of radiation can kill the organism.
Radiation damage can be divided into two types: (a) somatic damage (also called radiation
sickness) and (b) genetic damage. Somatic damage refers to damage to cells that are
not associated with reproduction. Effects of somatic radiation damage include reddening
of the skin, loss of hair, ulceration, fibrosis of the lungs, the formation of holes in tissue, a
reduction of white blood cells, and the induction of cataract in the eyes. This damage can
also result in cancer and death. Genetic damage refers to damage to cells associated with
reproduction. This damage can subsequently cause genetic damage from gene mutation
resulting in abnormalities. Genetic damages are passed on to next generation.
10.9.3 Radiation dose
The biological damage caused by the radiation is determined by the intensity of radiation
and duration of the exposure. It depends on the amount of energy deposited by the radiation
in the biological system. In studying the effects of radiation exposure in humans, it is
important to realize that the biological damage caused by a particle depends not only on
the total energy deposited but also on the rate of energy loss per unit distance traversed by
the particle (or “linear energy transfer”). For example, alpha particles do much more damage
per unit energy deposited than do electrons.
Radiation effects and radiation doses
A traditional unit of human-equivalent dose is the rem, which stands for radiation equivalent
in man.
At low doses, such as what we receive every day from background radiation (< 1 m rem),
the cells repair the damage rapidly. At higher doses (up to 100 rem), the cells might

not be able to repair the damage, and the cells may either be changed permanently
or die. Cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells when
they divide and may become cancerous.
At even higher doses, the cells cannot be replaced fast enough and tissues fail to function.
An example of this would be “radiation sickness.” This is a condition that results after high
doses is given to the whole body (>100 rem).
Nuclear explosions and accidents in nuclear reactors are a serious source of radiation
hazard. The effects of atomic explosions in Nagasaki and Hiroshima are still not forgotten.
The nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl in 1986 led to deaths of many reactor personnel
and a very large release of radionuclide to the environment causing a long term radiation
damage to the people living in the neighboring regions.
Accidents at nuclear power plants
Nuclear fission in the reactor core produces lot of heat which if not controlled can
lead to a meltdown of fuel rods in the reactor core. If a meltdown happens by
accident, it will release large quantities of highly dangerous radioactive materials in
the environment with disastrous consequences to the humans, animals and plants.
To prevent this type of accidents and reactor blow up, the reactors are designed to
have a number of safety features.
Inspite of these safety measures two disasters in the nuclear power plants are
noteworthy- namely at ‘Three Mile Island’ in Middletown (U.S.A.) in 1979, at
Chernobyl (U.S.S.R.) in 1986. In both these cases a series of mishaps and errors
resulted in over heating of the reactor core and lot of radiation was released into the
environment. The leakage from Three Mile Island reactor was apparently low and
no one was injured immediately. However, in case of Chernobyl the leakage was
very heavy causing death of some workers and radiation spread over large areas
scattered all over Europe. People of the city had to be evacuated to safer places
and the plant had to be closed down. These two disasters are a reminder that
nuclear power reactors require a constant up gradation of safety measures. Accidents
with nuclear submarines also points to the same.

Environmental Pollution

MODULE - 4
Contemporary
Environmental Issues

WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT
•

Nature’s components such as air, water, soil, forest and fisheries are resources exploited
by humans and their pollution are by-product of urbanization and industrialization.

•

Pollution in effect is an undesirable byproduct of industrialization and urbanization.

•

The agents directly or indirectly responsible for the pollution of the environment are
known as pollutants.

•

There are six types of pollutions: air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, soil
pollution, thermal pollution, radiation pollution etc.

•

Air pollution is a result of industrial and certain domestic activity.

•

Air pollutants are of two types (1) suspended particulate matter, and (2) gases like
carbon dioxide CO2, NOx etc.

•

Use of cleaner fuels such as biogas, CNG and electricity prevent air pollution.

•

Segregation of waste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking
indoor pollution.

•

Prevention and control of industrial pollution can be reduced by using cleaner fuels,
filters, electrostatic precipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers etc.

•

Use of chlorofluorocarbons cause damage of ozone layer which has resulted in its
thinning over the Arctic and Anctartic regions, is know as ozone hole.

•

Increase in global temperature or heating effect by green house gases (CO2, methane)
is known as green house effect.

•

Noise like other pollution is a by product of industrialization, urbanization and modern
civilization.

•

Indoor sources include noise produced by radio, television and outdoor source includes
indiscriminate use of loudspeakers, industrial activities, automobile, rail traffic and
aeroplanes etc.

•

Addition of undesirable substances in water is called water pollution.

•

Natural sources of water pollution are soil erosion, leaching of minerals from rocks
and decaying of organic matter.

•

Power plants and various industries used lot of water for cooling purposes and hot
water is discharged into rivers, streams or oceans. This waste heat increases the
temperature of the cooling water upto 10-150C this is thermal pollution.

•

Improper sewage disposal, dumping of farm yard manures and agricultural chemicals,
industrial effluents are causing pollution of ground water.

•

Nutrient enrichment of a water body is called eutrophication.

•

Waste water from domestic or industry or garbage dump is generally known as sewage.

•

Addition of substances which adversely affect the quality of soil or fertility is known as
soil pollution.

•

Sources of soil pollution are plastic bags, industrial sources, agricultural sources etc.

•

Radiation is a form of energy traveling through space. Radiation can be grouped into
non-ionizing radiation and the ionizing radiations.
