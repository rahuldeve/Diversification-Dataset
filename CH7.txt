Dynamic Loading of Structures

General Concepts

All the problems studied so far have been static or quasi-static. In any
complete solution of such a problem, the stress field satisfies the equilibrium
equation with the prescribed body force and the static boundary conditions
with the prescribed surface tractions. The effects of inertia are neglected.
In a body made of a standard perfectly plastic material, the ultimate
loading is the greatest loading under which a solution to the static problem
can be found such that the yield criterion is nowhere violated. If a loading in
excess of the limit loading is applied, then, obviously, the static problem (in
which, by definition, inertia is ignored) has no solution, and inertia effects
must be taken into account. If the time of loading is short, enough of the
external work may be transformed into kinetic energy so that excessive deformation is prevented; for example, when a nail is struck by a hammer, it may
experience a force in excess of its static ultimate load without permanent
deformation.
The problem of impact or impulsive loading of structural elements such
as beams, plates and shells has been most often treated within the constitutive framework of limit analysis: rigid–perfectly plastic behavior, with
the yield criterion in terms of generalized stresses. This approach, which
has been reasonably successful with regard to the determination of permanent deformations, is presented in this section; it is generally regarded as
justified when the energy imparted to the body greatly exceeds the elastic
energy that can be stored. If local constitutive equations are used, waves
propagate through the body. The propagation of one-dimensional and multidimensional waves in elastic-plastic bodies is studied in Sections 7.2 and
7.3, respectively.

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

It must be pointed out at the outset that the solution of dynamic problems on the basis of rate-independent plasticity is in conflict with the definition of rate-independent plastic behavior as the limiting behavior of viscoplastic bodies at very slow rates (see 3.1.2). The use of rate-independent
plasticity for such problems is based on the assumption of a “dynamic” yield
stress that is independent of rate in the range of rates encountered in the
dynamic problem, but not, in general, identical with the static yield stress.
The adequacy of this procedure, as opposed to the use of viscoplasticity theory, has long been the subject of debate and is discussed in 7.2.3. Until then,
the rate-independent model will be tacitly assumed.

Dynamic Behavior of Rigid–Perfectly Plastic Bodies:
General Results
Most of the structures for which static collapse loads have been determined on the basis of the rigid–perfectly plastic model have also been subject
to dynamic analysis; the solutions have been surveyed by Krajcinovic [1973]
and Jones [1975]. A common feature of the solutions is that if the body is
restrained against rigid-body motion, then the velocity field eventually takes
on a mode form in the sense that its spatial variation becomes independent of
time. In other words, the velocity becomes the product of a time-dependent
amplitude and a function of position:
˙
v(x, t) = ∆(t)w(x).
A proof that all solutions must converge to mode form is due to Martin
[1980]; it is based on an extremum principle,
according to which the final
√
mode is the one that minimizes Dint / K, where Dint is the total plastic
dissipation and K is the kinetic energy.
The fact that at least the final phase of the motion is in mode form means
that all points of the body come to rest at once. If the time at which this
occurs is ts , then the permanent displacement field up (x) can be found by
integrating the velocity over time from t = 0 to t = ts .
A theorem due to Martin [1975] gives a lower bound on ts for a body on
which all prescribed loads and prescribed surface velocities are zero for t >
t0 . Let v∗ be any kinematically admissible velocity field, with a strain-rate
field ε̇∗ derived from it. When the body force, prescribed surface traction
and prescribed surface velocity are all zero, the dynamic principle of virtual
velocities reduces to

The right-hand side of this inequality is independent of time, while on the
left-hand side only v̇ depends on time. If v0 (x) = v(x, t0 ), then, since
v(x, ts ) = 0, integration of both sides from t0 to ts leads to

The preceding results can easily be formulated in terms of generalized
stresses and strains.

7.1.2

Dynamic Loading of Beams

Equations of Motion for Elastic–Plastic Beams
The equations of motion of a beam according to the elementary (Euler–
Bernoulli) theory can be obtained by adding inertial forces to the distributed
load. We consider only a beam of doubly symmetric cross-section, with the
centroidal axis along the x-axis, and with bending confined to the xy-plane.

420

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

If the deflection in the positive y-direction is u(x, t), then the inertial force
per unit length is −ρ̄∂ 2 u/∂t2 , where ρ̄ = ρA is the beam mass per unit
length, ρ being the mass density and A the cross-sectional area. With q
denoting the distributed load per unit length, the equation of motion is

(7.1.3)

When q = 0, and a functional relation is assumed between the moment
M and the curvature κ = ∂ 2 u/∂x2 , it can be shown that the deflection can
be expressed as
u(x, t) = tf (η),
where η = x2 /t, and that κ (and hence M ) as well as the velocity v = ∂u/∂t
are functions of the single variable η alone. If, say, κ = Ψ(M ), then the
moment is governed by the differential equation

(7.1.4)

For a linearly elastic beam, Ψ0 (M ) = 1/EI, so that the equation is linear; a general solution is due to Boussinesq. For an elastic–plastic beam,
Equation (7.1.4) is in general nonlinear, and must be solved numerically.
It is, however, piecewise linear if a moment-curvature relation with linear
work-hardening is assumed, and an analytic solution can then be obtained.
The first such solution was found by Bohnenblust (see Duwez, Clark, and
Bohnenblust [1950]), who treated an infinitely long beam in which one point
is suddenly given a velocity that remains constant in time — equivalent to
being struck by a very heavy concentrated mass traveling at that velocity
(so heavy that the resistance of the beam is insufficient to decelerate it), or
as in the experiments that were performed by Duwez et al., to the beam
itself moving transversely as a rigid body before it impinges on a concentrated rigid obstacle. The deformation
remains elastic if the impact velocity
p
v0 does not exceed vE = κE EI/ρ̄, where κE is the elastic-limit curvature
as defined in 4.4.1. When v0 > vE and the hardening is linear, different
deformation patterns develop for vE < v0 < 2.087vE and for v0 > 2.087vE .
The analogous problem for rigid–plastic beams, with various types of
work-hardening and with extensions to variable velocity and to semi-infinite
beams, was treated by Conroy [1952, 1955, 1956, 1963]. Equation (7.1.4) for
such a beam is valid only in the plastic portions of the beam. In the rigid
portions, the moment is governed by Equation (7.1.3) with q = 0 and with
the deflection given by a straight-line function of x, say u(x, t) = f (t)+g(t)x.
The boundary between the rigid and plastic portions is itself an unknown
function of time. It was shown by Conroy [1952] how the plastic portions shrink to points, representing plastic hinges, in the limit as the workhardening decreases to zero. For linear hardening, Conroy [1955] showed
that certain problems can be solved by means of linear elastic analysis.

Impact Loading of a Perfectly Plastic Free-Ended Beam
The impact loading of a free-ended beam by a suddenly applied force
that is a prescribed function of position and time was studied by Lee and
Symonds [1952] for a rigid–perfectly plastic beam loaded at the center and by
Bleich and Salvadori [1953, 1955] for an elastic–perfectly plastic beam under
a loading that is symmetric about the midpoint but is otherwise arbitrary.
We consider, first, the problem treated by Lee and Symonds [1952]. A
free-ended beam of length 2L is suddenly loaded at its midpoint by a concentrated force F (t), which rises to a peak value Fm and declines to zero in a
short time. Let ∆(t) denote the midpoint displacement. It can be assumed
that at first the beam is accelerated as a rigid body, so that the displacement
is ∆ everywhere, and the load F is balanced by a uniformly distributed iner¨ with 2ρ̄L∆
¨ = F [see Figure 7.1.1(a)]. The bending moment at
tial force ρ̄∆,
a distance x from the midpoint may be obtained from the free-body diagram
of Figure 7.1.1(b), and is
M (x, t) =

F (t)
(L − x)2 ;
4L

the maximum moment is M (0, t) = F (t)L/4. The assumption of rigidbody motion is therefore valid as long as this moment is less than MU , or
F (t) < 4MU /L.

motion of one-half of the beam.
When F (t) ≥ 4MU /L, a plastic hinge must form at x = 0. Let the
half-angle of rotation of the hinge be θ(t), as in Figure 7.1.1(c). Because of
symmetry, it is sufficient to study the motion of half the beam, say 0 < x < L

422

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

[see Figure 7.1.1(d)]. Since the deflection is
u(x, t) = ∆(t) − xθ(t)
as long as θ(t)  1, the global force equation of motion may be obtained by
balancing the force F/2 acting on half the beam with the total inertial force:

It can easily be shown that this distribution has a local extremum in the
interior of the beam when φ(t) > 6, and that this extremum is located at
x/L = φ(t)/3[φ(t) − 4] and has the value −2MU [φ(t) − 6]3 /27[φ(t) − 4]2 .
This value equals −MU when φ reaches 22.9; an additional plastic hinge
then forms in each half of the beam. For F (t) ≥ 22.9MU /L, therefore, the
equations of motion must reflect the additional hinges, which move in toward
the middle as the load increases. Further results relative to this problem
were obtained by Symonds and Leth [1954] and by Cotter and Symonds
[1955]. The effect of distributed rather than concentrated loads was studied
by Salvadori and DiMaggio [1953] and by Seiler and Symonds [1954] (see
also Seiler, Cotter and Symonds [1956]). An extension of the method to
elastic–perfectly plastic beams is due to Alverson [1956].
Bleich and Salvadori [1953, 1955] examined the motion of an impulsively
loaded elastic–perfectly plastic beam by using the natural modes of vibration
of elastic beams — for the entire beam during the initial elastic phase, and for
the portions of the beam separated by plastic hinges after the beam yields,
provided that the hinges are stationary. Salvadori and DiMaggio [1953]
studied the development of hinges for various degrees of concentration of the
load, ranging from uniformly distributed to concentrated. For a comparison

between the results of Lee and Symonds and those of Bleich and Salvadori,
see the discussion by Symonds and by Bleich and Salvadori following the
paper by Bleich and Salvadori [1955]. The impact loading of a rigid–perfectly
plastic beam that is built in at both ends was studied by Symonds and Mentel
[1958], who took into account the axial forces that develop when such a beam
deflects.

Cantilever Struck by a Mass at Its Tip
The method of Lee and Symonds was applied by Parkes [1955] to study
the impact on a cantilever beam of length L by an object of mass m traveling
with a velocity v0 . The beam is again assumed to be rigid–perfectly plastic,
so that the kinetic energy of the striker can be absorbed only in a plastic
hinge. Initially the hinge is at the tip, but it moves in time toward the
built-in end.
Let x denote distance along the beam measured from the tip and ∆(t)
the tip deflection, and let x = x̄(t) give the position of the hinge at t. The
portion x > x̄(t) remains undisturbed. In the portion x < x̄(t), the curvature
rate κ̇ = ∂ 2 v/∂x2 (where v = ∂u/∂t) vanishes, so that the velocity is given

Since the plastic hinge occurs at a maximum of the bending moment, the
shear force there is zero, and therefore the net force on the moving portion
of the beam is zero. The translational equation of motion for this portion of
the beam is therefore

Thus the beam remains straight, and the deflection is that which is necessary

Parkes [1955] also carried out experiments in which mild-steel cantilever
beams were subjected to impact by relatively heavy weights dropped on
their tips, as well as by bullets. Reasonably good agreement with the theory
was obtained when MU was given a “dynamic” value based on the data of
Manjoine [1944] for the rate sensitivity of the yield stress of mild steel.
A numerical study of the Parkes problem by Symonds and Fleming [1984]
shows that when elasticity is taken into account, then the initial phase of

the deflection is not even approximately represented by the traveling-hinge
solution — that is, plastic deformation is not concentrated in a narrow zone
in the interior. On the other hand, convergence to mode form is a prominent
feature of the solution.

Dynamic Loading of Plates And Shells

Dynamic Loading of Rigid–Plastic Circular Plates
The dynamic problem of a simply supported rigid–plastic circular plate
that is suddenly loaded by a uniformly distributed pressure — a blast loading — was studied by Hopkins and Prager [1954], as a sequel to the same
authors’ static solution (Hopkins and Prager [1953]) discussed in 5.2.3. The
equilibrium equation (5.2.10) is replaced by the equation of motion,

The Tresca yield criterion, as represented by the hexagon of Figure 5.2.2
(page 310), is assumed. As in the static case, the plate is assumed to be in
regime BC, with point B corresponding to the center of the plate. A conical

called high pressures.

where r0 is given by Equation (7.1.9). For t > t1 , the velocity field (though
not the deflection) is fully conical, and is consequently in mode form.
Perzyna [1958] studied the effect of different time profiles of the pressure
pulse. The corresponding problem for a clamped plate was treated by Florence [1966]. The problem of impact loading of a circular plate, in which a
uniform velocity is suddenly imparted to the plate (except the edge), was
treated in a similar manner by Wang [1955] for a simply supported plate
and by Wang and Hopkins [1954] for a clamped plate. Non-axisymmetric
problems were treated by Hopkins [1957].
For simply supported plates, the results based on the Tresca criterion
are immediately transferable to the Johansen criterion, since regime BC of
Figure 5.2.2 is common to both. For clamped plates the criteria differ. The
blast loading of square clamped plates obeying the Johansen criterion was
studied by Cox and Morland [1959].

Pressure-Pulse Loading of a Cylindrical Shell
Relatively few dynamic problems have been solved for elastic–plastic or
rigid–plastic shells. We consider here a solution due to Hodge [1955] for
a circular cylindrical shell, made of a rigid–perfectly plastic material and
clamped at both ends, that is suddenly loaded by a uniform radial pressure
which does not decrease in time, the initial value of the pressure being greater
than the static ultimate pressure pU . For mathematical simplicity, the square
yield criterion of Figure 6.4.4 (page 409) is adopted; an analysis by Hodge
and Paul [1957] based on the hexagonal locus shows that the solution is not
greatly affected by changes in shape of the yield locus.
The static ultimate pressure may be obtained by assuming that Nθ = NU
throughout. The equilibrium equation (6.4.8)2 is then
Mz00 = p −

A collapse mechanism may be assumed to consist of hinge circles at the
center (z = 0) and at the built-in ends (z = ±L). For generalized-stress
points on side GH of the square of Figure 6.4.4, the associated flow rule
requires that u̇00 = 0. The radial velocity field is accordingly

If the pressure has a constant value p0 for 0 < t < t0 and then suddenly

short shell. For a short shell with pU < p0 < p1 (a moderate pressure), the

In a long shell (ω 2 > 6) under moderate pressure, the solution is valid
during the first phase but not after unloading. In order to obtain a valid
solution, we must abandon the hypothesis that the entire shell is in regime
GH of Figure 6.4.4. Instead, only a central portion of the shell, say |z| < z̄(t),
will be assumed to be in this regime, with the sections z = ±z̄(t) at point
G, and the remainder of the shell in regime GJ. In the latter regime the
flow rule gives u̇ = 0, and therefore the outer portions of the shell undergo
no further motion. The velocity field is thus

As the reader can see, there are a great many similarities between the
dynamic shell and plate problems formulated according to the rigid–perfectly
plastic model, and these in turn resemble the beam problems. The comments
expressed previously concerning the validity of the traveling-hinge solution
may therefore be expected to be applicable to structural impact problems
in general.

One-Dimensional Plastic Waves

Theory of One-Dimensional Waves

In studying the propagation of longitudinal stress and strain waves in a thin
bar, it is common to represent the problem by a “one-dimensional” approximation in which the only nonvanishing stress component is assumed to be
the longitudinal one, and the contribution of the transverse displacement to
the deformation and the inertia is ignored. It is known from elastic bar theory that this approximation yields good results at points of the bar whose
distance from the bar ends is more than a few diameters; near the ends,
three-dimensional corrections are necessary.
We let x denote the Lagrangian coordinate along the bar axis and u(x, t)
the corresponding displacement. The conventional (“engineering”) strain
ε(x, t) and velocity v(x, t) are then given by
ε=

∂u

v=

and satisfy the kinematic compatibility relation

(7.2.2)

where σ is the nominal (“engineering”) stress and ρ is the mass density in

435

The equations governing the problem of torsional motion of a thin-walled
circular tube are exactly the same as the preceding ones if u and v are interpreted as the circumferential displacement and velocity (uθ and vθ ), respectively, and ε and σ as the conventional shear strain and shear stress (γzθ
and τzθ ). Except for some comments concerning finite strain, the following
theory applies to the torsional problem as well.

Shock Fronts
A shock front is said to occur at a point x = α(t) of the bar if the
velocity v is discontinuous there. We suppose that the shock front is moving
at a finite speed c in the positive x-direction (say from left to right), that
is, c = α0 (t) > 0, and we designate the values of v just to the right (in
front) of the shock and just to the left of (behind) the shock by v + and v − ,
respectively. The jump in v is defined as
[|v]| = v − − v + .
Similar definitions apply to ε and σ. It is readily apparent that with v a
discontinuous function of x and of t, its partial derivatives with respect to
both variables are in effect infinite at the shock front. By Equation (7.2.2),
the same is true of ε and σ.
Relations among the jumps in velocity, strain, and stress may be derived
by treating the shock front as a thin zone in which these quantities change
very rapidly, their partial derivatives having large constant values. If the
shock thickness is h, then, approximately,
∂v
.
[|v]| = ±h ,
∂x
for a front moving to the left and to the right, respectively, with similar
relations for ε and σ.
Another approximation for the jump may be obtained by following it
along the time axis. Since v − is the earlier and v + the later value, and since
the duration of the shock passage at a given point is h/c, it follows that
. h ∂v
.
[|v]| =
c ∂t
Applying these approximations to Equations (7.2.1)–(7.2.2), we obtain the
shock relations

[|ε]| = ± [|v]| , [|σ]| = ±ρc[|v]| ,
(7.2.3)

where the + and − signs apply to fronts moving to the left and to the right,

Impact of a Rigid–Plastic Bar
As an application of the shock relations (7.2.3), we study the problem
of longitudinal impact of a bar treated as rigid–plastic. Suppose that the
bar, of length L, is moving rigidly at a speed v0 in the direction of its axis
until, at time t = 0, it squarely strikes a rigid target. The situation at t > 0
is shown in Figure 7.2.1; it is assumed that plastic deformation takes place
only in an infinitely narrow zone at x = ξ(t), where x is measured from the
free end [so that ξ(0) = L], with the remaining portions of the bar rigid. In

particular, the portion near the target, x > ξ(t), is assumed to have come to
rest, while the portion near the free end is moving with a uniform velocity:
v(x, t) = v̄(t), x < ξ(t),
v(x, t) = 0,
x > ξ(t).
The section x = ξ(t), since the velocity is discontinuous there, is the location
of a shock front moving in the negative x-direction with a speed c = −ξ˙ with
respect to the undeformed material. For convenience, stress and strain will
be taken as positive in compression, so that the signs in Equations (7.2.3)
are reversed.
We begin by assuming the bar as rigid–perfectly plastic, so that it is at
yield at the shock front. The true stress, then, equals σY at x = ξ(t) and
is continuous there. The nominal stress is also σY ahead of the front, but it
equals σY /(1−ε̄) behind the front if ε̄ is the strain there. The discontinuities
at the front are therefore

and the shock front stops when ξ(t) = ξ0 , so that the portion 0 < x < ξ0
remains undeformed.
The preceding analysis is equivalent to that of G. I. Taylor [1948], who
based it on a different approach. By means of some approximating assumptions Taylor derived a formula for the dynamic yield stress in terms of the
impact speed and the specimen dimensions before and after impact.
For a bar made of work-hardening material, the problem was treated by
Lee and Tupper [1954]. The geometry and notation are the same as in the
preceding treatment. If the conventional stress-strain relation is given by
σ = F (ε) and the initial yield stress is σE , then the material just ahead of

438

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

the shock front may be assumed to be about to yield, so that σ = σE there,
while immediately behind the front the stress is σ̄ = F (ε̄). The stress jump
is therefore [|σ]| = σ̄ − σE . From the shock relations we obtain, first,
ρξ˙2 =

which may be contrasted with (7.2.5), and second,
ρv̄ 2 = (σ̄ − σE )ε̄.

The initial strain at the impact end is related to the impact speed v0 by
means of

where σ0 = F (ε0 ). The relation between ε̄ and ξ, which provides the distribution of permanent strain along the bar, is obtained as

provided that ε̄ is positive; setting ε̄ = 0 gives ξ0 , which defines, as before, the
extent of the undeformed portion. The result was used by Lee and Tupper
[1954] in order to predict the permanent deformation of steel specimens, and
experiments performed by them showed fairly good agreement.

7.2.2

Waves in Elastic–Plastic Bars

Taking the elasticity of the bar into account changes the nature of the problem drastically. In an elastic solid, disturbances cannot be propagated at a
speed faster than the elastic wave speed. It would therefore be impossible
for the entire portion of the bar ahead of the plastic shock front to move as
a rigid body from the moment of impact; an elastic front has to intervene.
Moreover, when an elastic wave of compression reaches the free end, it is
reflected as a tension wave and will bring about unloading when it reaches
the plastically deforming material.
At a section of the bar where the material is elastic, with Young’s modulus E, we have [|σ]| /[p
|ε]| = E, so that the shock speed is just the elastic
bar-wave speed ce = E/ρ, independent of the local state variables. The
same is true when the behavior is elastic–plastic, provided that the stress
change across the shock represents unloading.

Donnell Theory
To understand the nature of a front of loading into a plastic state, it is
simplest to begin, following an approach due to Donnell [1930], by considering a material with a “bilinear” stress-strain relation (Figure 7.2.2). We

return to the convention of stress and strain as positive in tension. If the
initial state is stress-free, then any disturbance involving a stress increase
up to the yield stress σE will be propagated at the aforementioned elastic
speed ce . On the other hand,
p stress increases above σE will travel at the
slower “plastic” speed cp = E 0 /ρ. Thus in a semi-infinite bar occupying
the half-line x > 0 in which at t = 0 a stress σ0 > σE is applied at the left
end, we distinguish three regions, whose time dependence is shown in Figure
7.2.3:
0 : ce t < x
σ = 0,
I : cp t < x < ce t σ = σE ,
II : 0 < x < cp t
σ = σ0 .
The values of strain and velocity in each of the regions can be obtained
from the shock relations (7.2.3); they are shown in Figure 7.2.3.

Finite Bars
If the bar is of finite length, say L, and is supposed to occupy the interval
0 < x < L, then a front propagating to the right from x = 0 will, upon
reaching the end x = L, be reflected as one propagating to the left. The
nature of the reflected front depends on the end condition at x = L, and if the
bar is elastic–plastic, on the intensity of the incident front. End conditions
are assumed as being of two kinds: (a) free, characterized by σ = 0, and
(b) fixed , characterized by v = 0 if the frame of reference is stationary with
respect to the fixed end.
Consider, now, an elastic shock front, with a stress −σ0 and zero velocity
behind it, moving into a region of zero stress and velocity −v0 (so that from
the shock relations, σ0 = ρce v0 ) until it reaches a free right end. This is the
problem of an elastic bar traveling freely to the left, at a speed v0 , until it

impinges upon a fixed rigid obstacle.1 Behind the reflected front the stress
must be zero, so that it is a front of unloading, and therefore, by the shock
relations, the velocity behind it will be +v0 .
When the reflected front reaches x = 0, at the time t = 2L/ce after the
initial impact, it will in turn be reflected to the right. If this end is regarded
as a fixed end, then, in order to have v = 0 behind the second reflected
front, the stress there must be +σ0 , that is, a tensile stress. Unless the bar
somehow fuses with the obstacle, there is nothing to transmit a tensile stress
between them, and therefore the assumption that the left end is fixed for
t > 2L/ce must be abandoned in favor of the one that the end is free. In
this case, the state behind the second reflected front has σ = 0 and v = +v0 ;
that is, the bar rebounds from the obstacle. The rebound time is consequently
2L/ce .
If the bar is elastic–plastic, with a compressive yield stress σE , then the
def
preceding results are valid as long as σ0 ≤ σE , that is, if v0 ≤ σE /ρce = vE .
If v0 > vE , and if the material is modeled by a bilinear stress-strain relation
as on the previous page, then an elastic and a plastic shock front propagate
from the impact end at the respective speeds ce and cp , and the results for
the semi-infinite bar hold until the initial elastic front, with σ = −σE and
v = vE − v0 behind it, reaches the free end. The reflected front, being one of
unloading, is elastic, the stress behind it being zero and the velocity 2vE −v0 .
def

Let α = cp /ce . The reflected elastic and initial plastic fronts meet at
point A (Figure 7.2.4), with xA = 2αl/(1 + α) and tA = 2L/(1 + α)ce .

This problem was studied by Lenskii [1948] and De Juhasz [1949].

From this point, fronts may propagate both to the left and to the right.
We assume, first, that only elastic fronts propagate, leaving behind them
a region with σ = −σ1 and v = v1 . The strain cannot be uniform in this
region, since plastic deformation has taken place to the left of A but not
to the right of A. Thus a stationary discontinuity front, at which only the
strain is discontinuous, forms at A.

Figure 7.2.4. Finite bar of bilinear material: wave reflection and intersection.
The shock relations along the rightward and leftward fronts, respectively,
are
σ1 = ρce (v1 − 2vE + v0 ),

σ1 − σ0 = −ρce v1 .

Noting that σ0 = σE + ρcp (v0 − vE ), we obtain from these relations the
solutions σ1 = 21 ρce (1 + α)(v0 − vE ) and v1 = 21 [(3 − α)vE − (1 − α)v0 ]. In
order to justify the assumption that only elastic fronts propagate from A (in
other words, that the plastic front is absorbed at A), we must have σ1 < σE ,
the condition for which is v0 < [(3 + α)/(1 + α)]vE .
Let us assume that this last condition is met, and that the leftward elastic
front is reflected from the impact end as though rebound occurred, as with
the elastic bar, at t = 2L/c. The rebound velocity is found to be 2vE −v0 ; but
this is positive only if v0 < 2vE . This, then, is the condition for rebound at
t = 2L/ce . It can be ascertained that no further plastic deformation occurs,
and therefore the bar is left with a permanent deformation of ε0 − σ0 /E to
the left of point A.
If v0 > 2vE , then the bar remains in contact with the obstacle at least
until the next front reaches the left end. If 2vE < v0 < [(3 + α)/(1 + α)]vE ,
then the compressive stress holding them together is ρce (v0 − 2vE ).

442

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

If v0 > [(3 + α)/(1 + α)]vE , then the plastic front continues to the right
beyond A. Ahead of it, we have σ = −σE and v = 3vE − v0 . If the stress
and velocity behind it are again denoted −σ1 , v1 , then the shock relations
are
σ1 − σE = ρcp (v1 − 3vE + v0 ), σ1 − σ0 = −ρce v1 ,
yielding v1 = 2αvE /(1 + α).
It is clear that the numerical problem of determining the rebound time
becomes more complex as the impact velocity increases. Some solutions are
shown in Figure 7.2.5.

Kármán–Taylor–Rakhmatulin Theory
It is not difficult to extend the Donnell theory to materials whose stressstrain curve consists of more than two line segments, provided that the
overall curve is convex downward. Such a curve may in turn be regarded
as an approximation to one that is smooth beyond the yield stress (Figure
7.2.6). It is clear that as the segments become shorter, the jumps in the field
quantities at the plastic shock fronts become smaller. If the smooth curve
is seen as the limit of the segmented one, then it follows that in a bar made
of a material described by the smooth curve, no plastic shock fronts can be
propagated.
The theory that was developed independently by Taylor [1946, 1958],
von Kármán (see Kármán and Duwez [1950]) and Rakhmatulin [1945] during
World War II is based on complementing the basic field equations (7.2.1)–
(7.2.2) with the constitutive equation
σ = F (ε).

(7.2.10)

While its form is that of a nonlinear elastic stress-strain relation, Equation
(7.2.10) is assumed in this theory to hold only during an initial loading
process, unloading being linearly elastic. An initial yield stress σE may be
incorporated if F (ε) = Eε for |ε| < ε0 , where ε0 = σE /E (here it is assumed
that the initial loading curves are the same in tension and compression). The
function F (·) is assumed to be continuously differentiable, with F 0 (ε) > 0,
and convex in the sense that εF 00 (ε) ≤ 0.
A solution to the system of equations (7.2.1), (7.2.2), and (7.2.10) that
may be valid for some problems, at least in a certain region of the xt-plane,
can be obtained by assuming that the three variables σ, v, ε depend on x
and t only through the combination c = x/t, that is, that they are constant
along lines of slope c emanating from (0, 0). (Such a solution is sometimes
called a “similarity” solution.)
Since ∂c/∂x = 1/t and ∂c/∂t = −c/t,
Equations (7.2.1)–(7.2.2) become
dv = −c dε,

dσ = −ρc dv.

Figure 7.2.6. Piecewise linear and smooth stress-strain curves.
These equations are clearly of the same form as the shock relations (7.2.3),
with the jumps replaced by differentials. Indeed, the limit of the shock
relations for “infinitesimal shocks” propagating to the right takes precisely
the form of Equations (7.2.11).
Eliminating dv between the two equations (7.2.11) yields

ρc2 =

Combining this result with (7.2.10) leads to a relation between c and ε:
s

c(ε) =

(7.2.12)

Provided that the sign of ε is given, this relation will be assumed invertible
if |ε| > εE . Thus to any given c > ce there corresponds a value of ε and, by
(7.2.10), of σ. From the first of Equations (7.2.11) we deduce, in addition, a
relation for the velocity:

v=−

c(ε) dε,

(7.2.13)

the lower limit of the integral depending on the initial conditions.
The preceding solution can be applied to the problem of impact on a semiinfinite bar, treated previously according to the Donnell model. The notation
will be simplified by treating stress and strain as positive in compression,
and consequently the minus signs in Equations (7.2.11) and (7.2.13) will be
eliminated. The relations between the impact velocity v0 , the maximum
stress σ0 and the maximum strain ε0 are accordingly given by
Z ε0

c(ε0 )t < x < ce t, however, the state varies continuously, the solution being the “similarity” solution described previously. For x < c(ε0 )t, the state
is again uniform, as in the Donnell theory.
In a finite bar, with the right end x = L free, the incident elastic front
is again reflected as an unloading front, with a speed that is, at least at
first, equal to ce .2 However, this front propagates, from the outset, into a
region of plastically deformed material, with strains that are not necessarily
infinitesimal. At finite strain, the elastic relation ∆σ = E∆ε between stress
and strain changes, with E the Young’s modulus measured at small strains,
is not valid if σ and ε are the nominal stress and conventional strain, respectively. Experiments show, on the other hand, that the slope of the unloading
line is very nearly E if the stress and strain are taken as the true (Cauchy)
stress and the logarithmic strain, respectively. As we noted before, when the
strain is positive in compression then, with incompressibility assumed, the
true stress σt is related to the nominal stress σ by σ = σt /(1 − ε). Since the
change of strain in an elastic process is infinitesimal, we accordingly have
.
∆σ = ∆σt /(1 − ε), and ∆ ln(1 − ε) = ∆ε/(1 − ε). The unloading relation is,
consequently,
∂σ

Assuming, first, that ε0 is sufficiently small for the right-hand side of
(7.2.15) to be closely approximated by E, we can show that as in the Donnell
theory, rebound occurs at t = 2L/ce if v0 < 2vE . After rebound, the entire
bar is permanently deformed. As before, a plateau of permanent strain,
of value ε0 − σ0 /E, extends to the left of point A, while the permanent
strain decreases from this value to zero between A and the right end. The
distribution of permanent compressive strain is shown as a thickening of the
bar, since volume remains essentially constant. Thus the final shape of the
bar is as shown in Figure 7.2.7, and this shape has frequently been found in
tests.

Figure 7.2.7. Final shape of a bar with a smooth stress-strain curve.
If the strains are too large to be considered infinitesimal, then it follows
from Equation (7.2.15) that the elastic unloading front does not propagate
at the constant speed ce . Instead, its trace in the xt-plane is curved in the

The determination of the state behind this front must be accomplished numerically, for example, by the method of characteristics discussed in Section
5.1.

7.2.3

Rate Dependence

Dynamic Stress-Strain Relations
It was already pointed out by Kármán and Duwez [1950] that an assumed
stress-strain relation such as σ = F (ε) used in solving dynamic problems is
not necessarily the same as the stress-strain relation obtained from static or
quasi-static tests. Most metals are rate-dependent, or viscoplastic, and rateindependent plasticity, as was pointed out in Chapter 3, is an approximation
valid for sufficiently slow processes. The work of Kármán, Taylor, Rakhmatulin, and others who have followed the “rate-independent” approach is based
on the assumption of a “dynamic” stress-strain relation valid in the range
of strain rates that is encountered in dynamic tests, but not necessarily
identical with the static one. Kolsky and Douch [1962], among other experimenters, performed tests in which they deduced dynamic stress-strain
relations for several metals from wave-propagation experiments, and compared them with the static relations. The results showed that the relations
were markedly different, with the dynamic curve well above the static one,
for commercially pure copper and aluminum, but that they were identical for
a precipitation-hardened aluminum alloy. Many other experimenters have
obtained results, reviewed by Clifton [1983], in which the dynamic stresses
are well above the static ones. Bell [1968] is relatively alone among major
investigators in maintaining that the static stress-strain relation governs the
dynamic problem.
The appearance of a plateau of permanent strain, predicted by the KTR
theory, has been seen by many as justifying the “rate-independent” approach. Many others, however, have criticized this approach. In particular,
it has been pointed out that in most tests the plateau occurs in a region that
is too close to the impact end for the one-dimensional approximation, which
neglects shear deformation and transverse inertia, to be valid.
More generally, the very assumption of a dynamic stress-strain relation
that is more or less rate-independent in the dynamic range of rates has
been questioned. For example, it was found by Sternglass and Stuart [1953],
Bianchi [1964], and other investigators that in wires or bars that have been
statically prestressed into the plastic range (and not unloaded), additional
pulses travel at the elastic wave speed, in clear contradiction with the rateindependent model (see Clifton [1983] for a review of the relevant evidence).

Section 7.2 / One-Dimensional Plastic Waves

447

Viscoplastic Theory
An alternative theory, treating the material as viscoplastic, was proposed
by Sokolovskii [1948] and with somewhat greater generality by Malvern
[1951a,b]; the viscoplasticity model of Perzyna [1963], discussed in Section
3.1, is essentially a three-dimensional generalization of the model underlying
the Sokolovskii–Malvern theory. The constitutive equation used by Malvern
is
∂ε
1 ∂σ
=
+ g(σ, ε),
(7.2.16)
∂t
E ∂t
where the function g(σ, ε) vanishes for stresses whose magnitudes are below those given by the static stress-strain curve. For example, if the static
relation is given by σ = F (ε), then a possible form of g is
g(σ, ε) = G(|σ| − |F (ε)|)sgn σ,
where G 1s a function that is positive for positive argument and zero otherwise. In the Sokolovskii model, |F (ε)| = σE for |ε| ≥ εE , that is, the
static behavior of the material is taken as perfectly plastic. With G given
by G(x) = A < x >, A being constant, the resulting equation for g(σ, ε) is
just the one-dimensional version of the Hohenemser–Prager model [Equation
(3.1.3)].
The use of constitutive equations of the form (7.2.16) is not limited to
materials that are viscoplastic in the classical sense, that is, those that are
characterized by a static yield stress below which the behavior is elastic. It
is used in creep models such as the Bailey–Norton–Nadai law [see Equation
(2.1.6)], with g(σ, ε) = B|σ|m |ε − σ/E|−n sgn σ.
A generalized constitutive equation that includes both the rate-independent and the Malvern models as special cases was proposed in the early
1960s by Simmons, Hauser, and Dorn [1962], Cristescu [1964], and Lubliner
[1964]. This equation has the form
∂ε
∂σ
= f (σ, ε)
+ g(σ, ε)
∂t
∂t

(7.2.17)

for loading (σ∂σ/∂t > 0); for unloading, f (σ, ε) is replaced by 1/E, or if
finite strains must be taken into account, (1 − ε)2 /E. The Malvern theory
corresponds to the special case f (σ, ε) ≡ 1/E, and the KTR theory is recovered if f (σ, ε) = 1/F 0 (ε) and g(σ, ε) ≡ 0. Explicit calculations by Lubliner
[1965] and by Lubliner and Valathur [1969] show that solutions of impact
problems according to the generalized theory tend to those of the KTR theory if the bar is short, the impact is strong, and if the viscoplastic relaxation
time is long, while under the converse conditions the results of the Malvern
theory are approached.

Application of the Method of Characteristics

Characteristic Relations
The three equations (7.2.1), (7.2.2), and (7.2.17) form a system of partial
differential equations for the unknown variables σ, v, and ε. (Note that
in using these equations we are returning to treating stress and strain as
positive in tension.) As in Section 5.1, it is simpler to consider first a single
first-order partial differential equation of the form
A

∂v

we find that the left-hand side is proportional to dv = (∂v/∂x) dx+(∂v/∂t) dt
if dx = c dt, where c = A/B; the characteristic direction is thus defined by
dx/dt = c. Along a characteristic, then,

If a discontinuity in v, resulting from the intersection of two characteristics of the same family, should propagate, then it forms a shock front, as
discussed in 7.2.1. Any discontinuity in ∂v/∂t or ∂v/∂x that is propagated
through the xt-plane must (as discussed in 5.1.1) be across a characteristic,
and dx/dt = c is just the speed with which the front carrying the jump is
propagated. If v is the velocity, then a front across which the acceleration
∂v/∂t is discontinuous is called an acceleration wave.
The system formed by Equations (7.2.1)–(7.2.2) and (7.2.17) is equivalent

Since the KTR theory corresponds to g == 0, it is clear that Equations (7.2.11) representing the “similarity” solution are just the characteristic relations along characteristics of family (c), these characteristics being
curved. The lines x = ct along which the state variables are constant are the
characteristics of family (b). The characteristic network for the problem of
constant-velocity impact on a semi-infinite bar made of a rate-independent
material is shown in Figure 7.2.8(a).

Figure 7.2.8. Characteristic networks for impact on a semi-infinite bar made of
a rate-independent material: (a) constant-velocity impact; (b)
impact velocity rising to a peak and declining.
Suppose, now, that the impact is not sudden, but that the boundary
condition at x = 0 has the form v(0, t) = v0 (t), where v0 (0) = 0 and, for
t > 0, v0 is a continuous function that increases with t until it reaches a
maximum value vm at t = tm , after which it decreases.
As before, we may suppose the characteristics of family (a) to be straight
lines along which σ, v, and ε are constant. Rather than all of them emanating

from (0, 0), however, each one originates from a point on the t-axis such that
v = v0 (t). We may integrate the characteristic relations along families (b)
and (c) to obtain
Z ε
c(ε)dε, σ = F (ε).
v=
0

The second of these equations, however, is valid only in a loading process,
that is, only as long as ∂σ/∂t > 0. Since σ and v are monotonically related,
at x = 0 this condition prevails only for t < tm .
What happens then? As first demonstrated by Rakhmatulin [1945], a
front behind which ∂σ/∂t ≤ 0, called an unloading wave [see Figure 7.2.8(b)],
begins to propagate into the plastically deforming region of the bar. Since in
this region ∂σ/∂t > 0, across this front the stress rate ∂σ/∂t, and therefore
also the strain rate ∂ε/∂t and the acceleration ∂v/∂t, are discontinuous. An
unloading wave is therefore an acceleration wave.
The calculation of the unloading wave in the xt-plane must be performed
step by step. Its speed, say cu , is initially c(εm ), where εm is the strain at
(0, tm ). An example of a graphic construction, due to Rakhmatulin and
Shapiro [1948], is shown in Figure 7.2.9 (taken from Cristescu [1967]) for a
bar in which the stress at the end of the bar first increases monotonically,
then remains constant for a while, and finally decreases monotonically to
zero. As can be seen, the speed of the unloading wave increases as the wave

bounded by
c(ε) ≤ cu ≤ ce .
A proof of this result is given in Section 7.3, in which the general theory of
elastic–plastic acceleration waves is studied. In his first paper, Rakhmatulin
[1945] erroneously showed the unloading wave as attaining speeds faster
than that of the elastic wave (see the discussion by Bodner and Clifton
[1966]). More information on wave propagation in elastic–plastic and elastic–
viscoplastic bars can be found in the books by Cristescu [1967], Chapters II

Exercises: Section 7.2
1. Discuss how a shock front might form in an elastic–plastic bar whose
stress-strain curve beyond the initial yield stress σE is given by σ =
σE {1 + [(ε − σE /E)/α]2 }. Consider the limit of a rigid–plastic bar
(E = ∞).
2. For a given impact velocity v0 , find the distribution of permanent strain
following impact in a rigid–plastic bar of length L when the stressstrain relation beyond the initial yield stress is given by F (ε) = σE [1 +

a stress σ0 > σE which remains constant until t = t0 , whereupon it is
removed. Discuss the motion of the bar for various ranges of σ0 .
6. Repeat Exercise 5 for bars with the stress-strain relations of Exercises

of its arguments for σ > σE .

Section 7.3

Three-Dimensional Waves

Three-dimensional waves in rate-independent elastic–plastic solids appear
to have been studied first by Craggs [1957], who found relations for the
speeds of plastic waves on the basis of the characteristics of the governing differential equations. As in the one-dimensional case, the characteristic speeds coincide with those of acceleration waves, and in this section
only the acceleration-wave approach is followed. Furthermore, only rateindependent elastic–plastic solids are discussed. In elastic–viscoplastic solids

Section 7.3 / Three-Dimensional Waves

453

the wave speeds are those of elastic waves, while the study of specific dynamic boundary-value problems must, as a rule, be pursued numerically,
except when the constitutive model is so simple that analytical methods,
analogous to those used for linearly viscoelastic solids, may be used; examples of both approaches are given in the book by Nowacki [1978]. Acceleration waves in elastic–plastic solids were first investigated by Thomas [1958,
1961] for perfect plasticity, and with greater generality by Hill [1962] and
Mandel [1962].

7.3.1

Theory of Acceleration Waves

General Theory
The general theory of acceleration waves is due to Hadamard [1903]; a
modern exposition may be found in the monograph by Truesdell and Toupin
[1960]. It is presented here in a simplified form suitable for infinitesimal
deformations. We consider an acceleration wave moving in x1 x2 x3 -space at
the speed c. The unit normal vector to the wave surface, pointing in the
direction of wave motion, will be denoted n. The jump operator [|·]| will be
used as previously defined, and the superposed dot will denote ∂/∂t. A timedependent field φ is assumed to be continuous across the wave but to have
possibly discontinuous derivatives. At time t, φ has the value φ(x1 , x2 , x3 , t)
at a point of the wave front. At an infinitesimally later time t + dt, the given
point will have moved to xi + ni c dt, i = 1, 2, 3, and φ will accordingly have
the value φ(x1 , x2 , x3 , t) + dφ, where
dφ = φ,i ni c dt + φ̇dt.
The continuity of φ requires [|dφ]| = 0, or
cni [|φ,i |] = −[|φ̇]| .
Since, however, it is only the component of delφ along n that undergoes a
jump, [|φ,i |] must be proportional to ni , and therefore, since nj nj = 1,
c[|φ,j |] = −[|φ̇]| nj .
The last result is known as the Hadamard compatibility condition.
When applied to the velocity field v, the condition yields
c[|vi ,j |] = −[|v̇i|] nj .
When applied to the stress field σ and combined with the momentumbalance equation (1.3.1), it gives
[|σ̇ij|] nj = −ρc[|v̇i|] .

454

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

If, finally, the material is characterized by an effective tangent modulus tensor C̄ such that
[|σ̇ij|] = C̄ijkl [|ε̇ij|] ,
then combining all the results of this paragraph yields the eigenvalue problem
(Qik − ρc2 δik )[|v̇k|] = 0,
where

def

Qik = C̄ijkl nj nl

(7.3.1)

defines the acoustic tensor Q. The eigenvalues of Q, if positive, equal ρc2
with c the wave speed, while the eigenvectors are the directions of [|v̇]| or
polarization directions.

Elastic Waves
If the material is linearly elastic, then the tangent modulus tensor C̄ is
just the elastic modulus tensor C, and the corresponding acoustic tensor will
be denoted Qe :
Qeik = Cijkl nj nl .
(7.3.2)
If the material is also isotropic, then C is given by Equation (1.4.10), and
Qe is given by
Qeik = (λ + µ)ni nk + µδik .
One eigenvector is obviously n, with the corresponding eigenvalue being
λ + 2µ, so that the wave speed is

where ce = E/ρ is the elastic bar-wave speed defined in the preceding
section. Since the polarization direction coincides with that of propagation,
a wave of this nature is called longitudinal ; it is also known a dilatational
wave or a P-wave.
Any vector perpendicular to n is also an eigenvector of Q and corresponds
to the degenerate eigenvalue µ. The polarization being perpendicular to the
wave normal, the wave is called transverse (also a shear wave or an S-wave),
and its speed is
r

ce2 =

As in the bar studied previously, the elastic acceleration-wave speeds in
three-dimensional solids are independent of the local field variables, so that
all disturbances, including sufficiently weak shocks, travel at these speeds. A
shock is “sufficiently weak” if it does not entail temperature and/or density
changes large enough to affect the elastic moduli.

Section 7.3 / Three-Dimensional Waves

455

Elastic–Plastic Waves
We now consider an acceleration wave propagating in a standard elasticplastic solid as described in Section 3.2, with a yield function f . If f < 0
at the wave front, then the solid is behaving elastically, and the wave is an
elastic one. It will therefore be assumed that f = 0 at the wave front. Then
the relation (3.2.10) between stress rate and strain rate, with the normality
rule (3.2.7) incorporated, may be written, following Hill [1959], in the form
1
σ̇ij = Cijkl ε̇kl − Cijmn mmn <g>,

l = h + Cklmn mkl mmn ,

h being a plastic modulus, not exactly the same as in Section 3.2, but to
be specified more precisely later. Note that m is a unit tensor, that is,
mij mij = 1.
Applying the jump operator to Equation (7.3.3) yields
1
[|σ̇ij|] = Cijkl [|ε̇kl|] − Cijmn mmn [|<g>]| .
l
We may now write
[|<g>]| = η[|g]| ,
where η is a real number that depends on the ranges of g + and g − .
Several cases may be distinguished:

In addition, we may consider the situation where the material ahead of
the wave is about to yield (i.e., g + > 0), but is still elastic (i.e., σ̇ + = C · ε̇+ ).
Since g − > 0 also, we have
η=

g−

g− − g+

and thus obtain two additional cases:
(e) g − > g + : η > 1,
(f) g − < g + : η < 0.

456

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

The waves represented by these cases can be categorized as follows, according to Mandel [1962]: case (a) represents a plastic wave, with the material deforming plastically on both sides; case (b) an unloading wave; and
case (d) an elastic wave. Case (c), which was not considered by Mandel, can
be called a reloading wave. Cases (e) and (f) represent loading waves; the
former will here be called strong and the latter weak .
The effective tangent modulus C̄ may now be expressed as
C̄ijkl = Cijkl − ηNij Nkl ,
√

where Nij = Cijkl mkl / l. The acoustic tensor Q accordingly may be written
in the form
Qij = Qeij − ηdi dj ,
def

where Qe is given by (7.3.2), and di = Nik nk defines a vector d that Hill
[1962] calls the “traction” exerted by N on the wave front.

Analysis of Wave Speeds
The analysis to be presented is based on that of Mandel [1962]. Since Q is
symmetric, it has real eigenvalues and mutually perpendicular eigenvectors.
Whenever such an eigenvalue —psay A — is positive, it represents a a wave
propagated at the speed c = A/ρ. The symmetry of Q is due to the
assumption of an associated flow rule; the propagation of acceleration waves
in nonstandard elastic–plastic materials was also studied by Mandel [1964],
whose conclusions are summarized later.
In what follows, the eigenvalues of Q and Qe will be denoted Aα and
Aeα (α = 1, 2, 3), respectively, with the ordering A1 ≥ A2 ≥ A3 and Ae1 ≥
Ae2 ≥ Ae3 . If a Cartesian basis is chosen along the eigenvectors of Qe , then
the characteristic equation of Q is
F (A) = 0

+ d22 (Ae1 − A)(Ae3 − A) + d23 (Ae1 − A)(Ae2 − A)].
The character of the roots of Equation (7.3.4) depends on η. The simplest
case is η = 0, corresponding to an elastic wave. In this case, of course,
Aα = Aeα (α = 1, 2, 3).

Section 7.3 / Three-Dimensional Waves

457

If η > 0, as in cases (a)–(c) and in case (e), then F (Ae1 ) = −ηd21 (Ae1 −
Ae2 )(Ae1 − Ae3 ) ≤ 0. Similarly, F (Ae2 ) ≥ 0, F (Ae3 ) ≤ 0, and F (−∞) = +∞.
Consequently,1
A3 ≤ Ae3 ≤ A2 ≤ Ae2 ≤ A1 ≤ Ae1 .
Furthermore, the Aα decrease monotonically with η. If Apα denotes the value
of Aα for η = 1 (plastic wave), and Auα a value of Aα for 0 < η < 1 (unloading
and reloading), then we have the inclusion
Apα ≤ Auα ≤ Aeα ,

α = 1, 2, 3.

Here we see the bounding of the wave speed of an unloading wave, previously
obtained by Lee [1953] for waves in a thin bar.2
The speeds of strong loading waves, case (e), are even slower than those
of plastic waves. The inclusions are
p
Asl
3 ≤ A3 ,

p
Ae3 ≤ Asl
2 ≤ A2 ,

p
Ae2 ≤ Asl
1 ≤ A1 .

In fact, Asl
3 may be zero, in which case the surface does not propagate.
In a weak loading wave, case (f), η is negative and therefore the nature
of the roots changes drastically. The ordering of the wave speeds is
p
Ae3 ≤ Awl
3 ≤ A2 ,

p
Ae2 ≤ Awl
2 ≤ A1 ,

Ae1 ≤ Awl
1 .

The existence of waves propagating faster than elastic waves (in a bar) was
apparently first noted by Lee [1953]. Mandel [1962] gave, as an example of
such a wave moving at an infinite speed, the loading wave in a finite bar
following reflection from a fixed end.
An analysis of plastic waves in a nonstandard material, also due to Mandel [1964], shows that (a) the eigenvectors of Q are not mutually perpendicular, (b) Ap3 may be negative (representing a slip or rupture surface rather
than a wave), and (c) Ap1 may be greater than Ae1 . While soils are usually modeled as nonstandard in static problems, theories of waves in soils
have typically been based on standard elastic–plastic models, for example
by Grigorian [1960] and by Chadwick, Cox, and Hopkins [1964].

Isotropically Elastic Materials
If the material is elastically isotropic, with the modulus tensor given by
(1.4.10), and if in addition it is plastically incompressible (tr ε̇p = 0), so that
mkk = 0, then
Cijkl mij mkl = 2µmij mij = 2µ,
1
It was also shown by Mandel [1962] that A3 > 0 for η ≤ 1, except that Ap3 may be zero
if the material is perfectly plastic.
2
As pointed out in the preceding section, Rakhmatulin’s [1945] finding of an unloading
wave propagating faster than the elastic wave is erroneous.

If plastic isotropy is also assumed, then the hardening modulus h can be
related very simply to the uniaxial tangent modulus as well as to the tangent
modulus in shear. Recalling the definition of g and multiplying every term

Consequently,
σ̇11 =

Plastic incompressibility further implies that
σ̇11 = (3λ + 2µ)(ε̇11 + 2ε̇22 ).

so that h = 23 H, where H = dσY /dεp is the uniaxial tangent plastic modulus.
It can also be easily shown that h is twice the shearing tangent plastic
modulus dτY /dγ p .
The eigenvector of Qe corresponding to the fastest elastic wave (the
longitudinal wave) is of course n. If this is identified with e1 , then d is given
by

Since any vector perpendicular to n is also an eigenvector of Qe , we are free
to choose e2 and e3 in the tangent plane of the wave; let us choose them so
that d3 = 0. The eigenvalue problem now reads

Obviously, one eigenvector is e3 , with the corresponding eigenvalue A2 =
µ = Ae2 = Ae3 (necessary because Ae3 ≤ A2 ≤ Ae2 ). Hence, at any η, an elastic
transverse wave can propagate. If η > 0, then we also have A3 ≤ Ae2 ≤ A1 ≤
Ae1 , a result first derived by Craggs [1957]. The waves corresponding to A1
and A3 are in general neither longitudinal nor transverse, unless d1 d2 = 0.
When neither d1 nor d2 is zero, the waves are called longitudinal–transverse.

7.3.2

Special Cases

Purely Longitudinal and Transverse Waves
(a) If d2 = 0, then A3 = µ and the polarization is along e3 . In this case
both transverse waves are elastic, while for the longitudinal wave we obtain
A1 = λ + 2µ − ηd21 = λ + 2µ − η

4µ2
m2 .
h + 2µ 11

The tensor m can be shown to have the same form as in the quasi-static
uniaxial test: m13 = 0 because d3 = 0 by choice of basis, m12 = 0 because
d2 = 0 by hypothesis, m23 = 0 because [|ε̇23|]p= 0, and m22 = m33 = − 12 m11
from the resulting symmetry; hence m11 = 2/3, and
A1 = λ + 2µ −

4ηµ
.
3(1 + h/2µ)

(7.3.6)

Note that for h = 0 (perfect plasticity) and η = 1 (plastic wave) we have
A1 = λ + 23 µ = K, the elastic bulk modulus. In this case the longitudinal
wave may be said to propagate as though the material were a fluid.
(b) If d1 = 0, then, by contrast, it is the longitudinal wave that is elastic
(A1 = λ + 2µ), and in addition to the elastic transverse wave with A2 = µ,
there is a transverse wave with
A3 = µ − ηd22 = µ − η

4µ2
m2 .
h + 2µ 12

It can easily be shown √that this case is equivalent to quasi-static simple
shear, so that m12 = 1/ 2, and
ηµ
A3 = µ −
.
(7.3.7)
1 + h/2µ
For η = 1 (plastic wave), A3 reduces to the tangent modulus in shear,
µh/(2µ + h). If h = 0 (perfect plasticity), then A3 = (1 − η)µ, so that a
transverse plastic wave (η = 1) or a transverse strong loading wave (η > 1)
cannot be propagated.

Longitudinal–Transverse Waves
In an isotropic and homogeneous half-space, say x1 > 0, whose boundary x1 = 0 is subject to time-varying tractions (or displacements) that are

460

Chapter 7 / Dynamic Problems

uniform over the plane (i.e., independent of x2 and x3 ), all the field variables
may be assumed to be functions of x1 and t only, and the wave is said to be
plane. A plane wave is longitudinal if the traction or displacement is purely
normal, and transverse if the traction or displacement is purely tangential. If
the boundary tractions or displacements include both normal and tangential
components, then the wave is longitudinal–transverse.
The propagation of longitudinal–transverse plane waves in an elastic–
perfectly plastic half-space was studied by Bleich and Nelson [1966], and in
an elastic–plastic half-space with work-hardening by Ting and Nan [1969]; for
further references, see Nowacki [1978], Section 22. Here, we limit ourselves
to finding expressions for the wave speeds through a direct application of
Equation (7.3.5).
If the tangential traction is in the x2 -direction, then the half-space can be
assumed to be in a state of plane strain, so that, if the material is isotropic,
σ13 = σ23 = 0. Furthermore, all field quantities, including the velocity, can
be assumed to be independent of x2 , so that ε̇22 = 0. The Lévy–Mises flow
rule requires that σ22 = σ33 , and the stress-deviator tensor is given by

It can easily be ascertained that the special cases τ = 0 and s = 0 lead to
Equations (7.3.6) and (7.3.7), respectively. For a plastic wave (η = 1) in an

Section 7.3 / Three-Dimensional Waves

461

elastic–perfectly plastic medium (h = 0) the equation reduces to the result
of Bleich and Nelson [1966]:
3s2 (A − µ)(A − K) + 4τ 2 A(A − λ − 2µ) = 0.
A problem closely related to that of longitudinal–transverse waves plane
waves in a half-space is that of longitudinal–torsional waves in a long thinwalled cylindrical tube. This problem was studied by Clifton [1966, 1968]
and T. C. T. Ting [1969].

Spherical Radial Wave
Purely longitudinal waves arise when the loading is spherically or cylindrically radial, such as that produced by the explosion of a point charge or
a line charge in an infinite medium. The cylindrical problem is relatively
complicated, since the condition of plane strain must be enforced, and the
problem depends on the yield criterion chosen. The spherical problem is
fairly simple; it was first treated by Lunts [1949].
In an isotropic and plastically incompressible elastic–plastic solid, a spherically symmetric state of deformation requires εpθ = − 21 εpr , and is equivalent
to a state of uniaxial stress equal to σr − σθ . The yield criterion may be
written as
|σr − σθ | = σY (εpr ),
where σ = σY (εp ) is the uniaxial relation between yield stress and plastic
strain. If, now, H is again the uniaxial plastic modulus, then
ε̇pr =

<sgn (σr − σθ )(σ̇r − σ̇θ )>
H

when the yield criterion is obeyed. It will be assumed that the loading is
compressive, that is, that σr − σθ = −σY . If v denotes the radial velocity,
and if (·)0 = ∂(·)/∂r, then the radial and tangential strain rates are given by

Applying the jump operator to this equation leads to [|σr0 |] = ρ[|v̇]| . If, as
before, A = ρc2 , where c is the wave speed, then the Hadamard compatibility
conditions give [|v 0|] = ρ[|σ̇r|] /A. Since the velocity itself is continuous at

Since h = 23 H, it can easily be seen that this equation is equivalent to (7.3.6)
with η = 1.

Cylindrical Shear Wave
A purely transverse wave will be propagated cylindrically if, for example,
a rigid axle, embedded in an infinite medium, suddenly has a torque applied
to it. If the medium is isotropic, then it may be assumed that the only
velocity component is the circumferential velocity vθ = v(r, t) and the only
stress component is σrθ = σθr = τ (r, t). The equation of motion is
τ0 + 2
