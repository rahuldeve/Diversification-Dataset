Executive Summary
In the United States, more than $100 billion is spent annually to provide energy to American homes. Improving
the energy efficiency of the U.S. housing stock can result in significant benefits for homeowners, the economy,
and the environment. Energy-efficient homes are typically more comfortable, better constructed, more fireresistant, less expensive to operate, and they introduce fewer harmful emissions to the environment than a
home built to conventional standards. Energy-efficient homes also retain their value better and can be more
affordable if borrowers take advantage of a variety of energy-efficient mortgage products available only with
houses that meet energy efficiency criteria. In addition, builders can build houses and market them as energy
efficient to increase their market share, and real estate professionals can increase their commissions by selling
houses that have the additional energy-efficient features. However, energy efficiency is often not as important
in the home-buying decision as are other factors, such as location, number of bedrooms, air conditioning, and
other amenities.
One reason for this is that home builders and home buyers have a strong tendency to minimize the “up-front”
cost of a new property, even at the expense of future savings. Another reason that energy efficiency
technologies are not more widely used may be that homeowners may not be aware of the cost-effectiveness
of these technologies or how they can improve the efficiency of their homes. A third reason is that conventional
mortgage loan practices do not consider the lower total cost of owning an energy-efficient home when energy
expenses are added to mortgage and tax payments.
Two tools that can help improve the energy efficiency of the nation’s housing stock are home energy ratings
systems (HERS) and energy-efficient mortgages (EEMs). A home energy rating is a standardized system for
rating the energy efficiency of residential buildings. The home energy rating is a standard measurement of a
home's energy efficiency. Most home energy ratings involve an on-site inspection of a home by a trained and
certified residential home energy rater. The home energy rater inspects the home and measures its energy
characteristics, such as insulation levels, window efficiency, wall-to-window ratios, the heating and cooling
system efficiency, the solar orientation of the home, and the water-heating system. For most home energy
ratings systems, the measurements are then entered into a computer program that produces a report of the costeffective options for improving the home’s energy efficiency, as well a “rating” of the home’s energy
efficiency and estimated energy costs.
An energy-efficient mortgage is any home mortgage for which the underwriting guidelines have been adapted
specifically for energy efficiency features, or for which any form of financing incentive is given for energy
efficiency. Several of the lenders offering EEMs require that a home energy rating be performed to verify that
the energy efficiency of the home warrants an EEM.
Although the idea of using EEMs to spread the initial cost of improvements over time, thus reducing a major
hurdle for homeowners, has existed since the early 1980s, the mortgage industry was reluctant to make loans
for energy improvements without verified energy cost savings. And HERS, also in use since the 1980s, was
not systematically used as a basis for mortgage lending.
In October 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), which provided for the
establishment of credible voluntary national guidelines for residential energy rating systems (hereafter called
home energy rating systems) and for a pilot test of EEMs through federal loan instruments in five states. In
support of EPACT, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiated two paths: (1) working with stakeholders,
DOE acted to develop a set of credible technical guidelines that could be used on a voluntary basis to provide
accurate outputs on energy improvements and cost savings for homeowners and mortgage lenders; and (2)

iv

working with the HERS providers in seven states, DOE developed a program to link HERS with EEMs in the
states and to evaluate the program’s progress. This report focuses on the second path.
Following the guidelines established in EPACT, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) selected five states for an EEMs pilot program—Alaska, Arkansas, California, Vermont, and Virginia.
DOE funded a lead HERS provider organization in each of these states, as well as Colorado and Mississippi,
as HERS/EEMs pilot states whose purpose was to increase the use of HERS and EEMs. The HERS provider
organizations were funded to recruit and train raters, process ratings, and provide assistance to other states that
wanted to start HERS programs.
HERS activity is widespread in the United States, in part because of the efforts of the pilot HERS provider
organizations. The number of states with home energy ratings available has increased from 17 in 1993 to 47
in 1999. Between 1993 and 1998, 63,165 ratings were completed in the seven pilot states, and 8,428 Federal
Housing Administration/HUD EEMs were completed. At the end of 1998, 328 trained and certified raters were
active. Currently, the cost of delivering ratings is higher than the fees charged for ratings, resulting in a net loss
for each rating performed. In the HERS/EEMs pilot program, a subsidy was provided that covered the
difference.
Although each of the pilot states’ circumstances are different, a few common themes appeared during the five
years of the pilot program. HERS providers with the following characteristics had a higher market penetration
of home energy ratings:

High levels of funding over relatively short time periods
State-funded financial incentives for energy efficiency financing for mortgage borrowers
Financial incentive for lenders to market EEMs
Diversification of services
Continuity in HERS program leadership
Active involvement of key stakeholders.

Overall, most of the HERS provider organizations in the pilot states believe that federal funding—along with
a national marketing campaign and public service announcements—are needed to support their activities. All
of the HERS provider organizations believe that federal programs, such as the ENERGY STAR Homes
program, should be required to use ratings for their certifications.

Introduction
Two tools that can help improve the energy efficiency of the nation’s housing stock are home energy ratings
systems (HERS) and energy-efficient mortgages (EEMs). A home energy rating is a standardized system for
rating the energy efficiency of residential buildings. The home energy rating is a standard measurement of a
home’s energy efficiency. Most home energy ratings involve an on-site inspection of a home by residential
energy efficiency professional, a home energy rater. Home energy raters are typically trained and certified by
the operating HERS. Many home energy raters have backgrounds in the housing or energy fields and include
experience as home inspectors, appraisers, energy auditors, low-income weatherization contractors, and energyefficient home builders and designers. The home energy rater inspects the home and measures its energy
characteristics, such as insulation levels, window efficiency, wall-to-window ratios, the heating and cooling
system efficiency, the solar orientation of the home, and the water-heating system. Diagnostic testing, such as
blower door for air leakage and duct leakage testing, is often part of the rating. For most home energy ratings
systems, the measurements are then entered into a computer program that produces a report of the costeffective options for improving the home’s energy efficiency, as well a “rating” of the home’s energy
efficiency and estimated energy costs.
An EEM is any home mortgage for which the underwriting guidelines have been adapted specifically for
energy efficiency features, or for which any form of financing incentive is given for energy efficiency. Several
lenders who offer EEMs require that a home energy rating be performed to verify that the energy efficiency
of the home warrants an EEM.
In the early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiated action to link EEMs with home energy
rating systems. The idea of using EEMs to spread the first cost of improvements over time, thus reducing a
major hurdle for homeowners, had been in existence since the early 1980s. But the mortgage industry was
reluctant to make loans for energy improvements unless the energy improvements actually saved on borrowers’
monthly energy costs. HERS had also been used during the 1980s, but had not been systematically tied to
mortgage lending. DOE, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
convened the National Collaborative on Home Energy Rating Systems and Mortgage Incentives for Energy
Efficiency in 1991. Its mission, completed in 1992, was to reach consensus on a voluntary national program
to link credible HERS with mortgage incentives for energy-efficient housing (HERS/EEMs National
Collaborative 1992a, 1992b). Widespread availability of EEMs, combined with accurate HERS, was intended
to make it easier and more affordable for Americans to live in energy-efficient homes.
A few months after the Collaborative’s Blueprint for Action was published, Congress passed the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (EPACT), which provided for the establishment of credible voluntary national guidelines for
residential energy rating systems (hereafter called home energy rating systems) and for a pilot test of EEMs
through Federal loan instruments in five states. In carrying out its part of the mandate under EPACT, DOE
initiated two parallel paths:


Working with stakeholders, DOE acted to develop a set of credible technical guidelines that could be used
on a voluntary basis to provide accurate outputs on energy improvements and cost savings for homeowners
and mortgage lenders.



DOE, working with the HERS providers in the pilot states selected by HUD (Alaska, Arkansas, California,
Vermont, and Virginia), developed a program to link HERS with EEMs in the states and to evaluate the
program’s success.

1

The first path, on technical guidelines, is described in Plympton (2000) on the national status of HERS/EEMs.
This report covers the second path taken by DOE, on institutionalizing the use of HERS to provide a technical
basis for mortgage lending to pay for energy improvements in housing.

The HERS/EEMs Pilot State Programs
A HERS program already existed in each of the pilot states selected by HUD in 1993. These were as follows:


Alaska:

Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC)
and Energy Rated Homes of Alaska (ERH-AK)



Arkansas:

Energy Rated Homes of Arkansas (ERH-AR)



California:

California Home Energy Efficiency Rating System (CHEERS)



Vermont:

Energy Rated Homes of Vermont (ERH-VT)



Virginia:

Virginia Home Energy Rating Organization (V-HERO)

DOE worked with the HERS provider organizations in each of the pilot states to foster the development of
infrastructures to provide home energy ratings and to link rating outputs with EEMs.

The HERS/EEMs Pilot States Working Group and the Evaluation Working Group
After HUD selected the original five EEMs pilot states, DOE convened a Pilot States Working Group (PWG),
attended by the HERS provider program directors. The Working Group’s purpose was to provide a forum in
which the HERS providers could share information and common problems, and seek solutions to those
problems. In addition, it provided a venue for HUD’s director of Single-Family Housing to provide details on
the ways in which the EEMs would be put into practice and to discuss HUD’s efforts to promulgate the EEM
to loan underwriters. The PWG met several times during 1993 and 1994.
Stemming from the PWG, an EEMs Evaluation Working Group (EWG) met three times during the spring of
1994.1 The EWG identified important research questions; defined measures of success, identified data sources;
and helped devise an evaluation strategy, data collection plans, and management responsibilities for the
evaluation; and reviewed drafts of an evaluation plan. The EWG provided a forum to link HERS and mortgage
data and helped ensure that evaluation results are consistent and comparable across the pilots.

1

Participants included representatives from the pilot states, HUD/Federal Housing Administration (FHA),
utility companies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Housing Service (formerly the Farmers Home
Administration), U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Rated Homes of
America (ERHA), California Energy Commission, Alliance to Save Energy, Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae), state energy offices, federal power administration, universities, and national laboratories.

Evaluation Methods
The EWG’s evaluation plan has guided data collection on HERS/EEMs programs. The data used in this report
were provided during the course of several years by the HERS provider organizations in the HERS/EEMs pilot
states. (See Appendix B for a listing of these organizations and the key HERS provider contacts.) In
preparation for this report, which updates earlier evaluation reports (Collins, et al. 1994; Collins, Farhar, and
Walsh 1996; Farhar, Collins, and Walsh 1996, 1997), the program directors were interviewed at length during
1999, and they also provided once again the quantitative information on program characteristics (such as
budgets) and accomplishments (such as the number of ratings completed) that had been gathered previously.
The HERS providers reviewed the numerical information for accuracy.
The data on EEMs were obtained from HUD/FHA’s Computerized Housing Underwriting Management
System (CHUMS), which records mortgage data nationwide for FHA’s loan products. Although these data
are known to have problems,2 they derive from the only relatively consistent source of information on the
number of EEMs in the nation. Other federal EEM programs (those offered by the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs and the Rural Housing Service) do not use home energy ratings as a basis for their EEMs.
Although the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Association, or Freddie Mac, use rating outputs for their pilot programs, they do not use ratings for the 2%
debt-to-income ratio stretch, and they do not earmark EEMs in their databases. The Alaska Housing Finance
Corporation (AHFC) keeps data on its Alaska EEMs, which are based on ratings.

Barriers to Progress
Many barriers to widespread use of HERS/EEMs have been identified. The major barriers appear to include:


Lack of lender incentives (no need to offer EEM product to make money—low interest rates have led to
refinancing boom and, later, housing boom; EEMs are perceived as an extra “hassle” that lenders have no
incentive to pursue; an $8,000 increment in a mortgage does not result in much profit for lenders unless
done in volume; few HUD/FHA quotas for EEMs; EEMs not used for HUD Homes)3



Lender risk aversion (fear that increasing loans to 110% of market value will result in financial loss in the
event of default; uncertainty that housing operating costs will actually be reduced; fear that EEMs will not
be marketable to banks’ own investors, even if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase them)



Lack of data on comparables, defaults, and on which loans are energy-efficient loans



Lack of builder incentives (EEMs do not fit the way builders arrange their financing with banks; builder
reluctance to change construction techniques; builders want nothing to interfere with their production
schedule and dates of closing; builder perception that home buyers do not care about energy efficiency)

2

See footnote 9.

3

HUD Homes are homes with loans insured by FHA that had to be repossessed because of foreclosures; the
agency sells the homes as quickly as possible.

3



Lack of customer awareness of EEMs and energy efficiency benefits and concomitant lack of customer
demand; EEMs only make a difference between a borrower qualifying and not qualifying for a loan in a
small percentage of the real estate lending market (perhaps 7%)



Insufficient builder, lender, and real estate professional awareness and training



Low utility rates (both gas and electric)



Lack of sufficient funding to institutionalize ratings, advertise to customers, and develop a national HERS
industry



Lack of EEMs uniformity



Cost of home energy ratings (subsidies by federal and state governments needed to pay for costs of
production)



To date, limited participation in energy efficiency financing on the part of the secondary mortgage markets.

Brief Overview of the Report
This report covers the accomplishments of the HERS/EEMs pilot states from 1993 through 1998,4 including
such indicators as funding, ratings and EEMs achieved, active raters, and training and marketing activities.
A brief description of each HERS program’s evolution is included, as well as their directors’ views of the
programs’ future prospects. Finally, an analysis is provided of successful HERS program characteristics and
factors that appear to contribute to HERS program success.

4

The original five EEMs pilot states were designated by HUD in May 1993; HERS provider organizations
in Mississippi and Colorado were funded by DOE beginning in FY 1996.

Accomplishments
How well have the HERS programs realized the national goal of linking home energy ratings with energy
efficiency financing? This section discusses the many roles that the HERS programs played in their effort to
link and spread the use of ratings and EEMs. Data are presented on the human resources developed; the ratings
accomplished; the marketing, training, and education conducted; and the EEMs achieved. The extent to which
ratings have been used in energy efficiency financing in the HERS/EEMs pilot states is also described.

Ratings
The number of residential ratings completed during the pilot program is one indicator of their effectiveness.
Figure 1 and Table A-2 (in Appendix A) show the raw numbers of ratings completed by the pilot states. A total
of 63,165 ratings have been completed in the seven pilot states from 1993 through 1998.5 The highest number
of ratings occurred in California (23,645); Virginia completed the next most, at 18,410 ratings. However, the
pilot states vary substantially in population.

Figure 1. Ratings Completed in HERS/EEMs Pilot States by Year, 1993–1998

5

Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Mississippi, Vermont, and Virginia process ratings performed in other states;
these are not counted in the totals.

5

Because the states in which the pilot programs operate vary considerably in population,6 normalizing the
number of ratings permits a more adequate assessment of rating performance. Figure 2 presents the number
of ratings, counted cumulatively from 1993 through 1998, as a percentage of total number of households in
1998 by pilot state. The figure shows that, proportionally, Alaska had the highest number of ratings at 6% of
the total number of households in 1998. Ratings in the other pilot states amounted to less than 1% of total
households, although HERS were not offered in Colorado and Mississippi until 1996.

Figure 2. Percentage of Cumulative Ratings per Total
Number of Households in 1998 by Pilot State7

EEMs
The number of EEMs completed during the pilot program is another indicator of their effectiveness. From FY
1994 through FY 1998, a total of 8,534 FHA EEMs were completed in the seven pilot states, with a total value
of $902.35 million.
The HERS providers also spent part of their resources to educate themselves about EEMs programs and to
design HERS outputs that would work well with EEMs processes. Mortgage activities in the HERS/EEMs
pilot states are summarized in Table A-3 (in Appendix A) for FHA and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
loans and EEMs. Figure 3 shows that, nationwide, EEMs—showing low market penetration —amounted to
approximately 1.5% of FHA loans in FY 1998.

Figure 3. FHA EEMs as a Percentage of Total FHA Loans by Fiscal Year8

Figure 4 shows the number of FHA EEMs as reported in the FHA CHUMS database for FY 1993 through FY
1998 for the HERS/EEMs pilot states. The raw numbers of EEMs are also reported in Table 1. FHA reports
no EEMs for Colorado and Mississippi until FY 1996, after their HERS programs were in operation.
Nevertheless, California (6,042), Colorado (1,106), and Virginia (819) have the most EEMs completed
between FY 1993 and FY 1998. The number of EEMs reported in Colorado rose from 143 in FY 1997 to 930
in FY 1998, more than a 600% increase in one year, a much higher increase than that in any other pilot state.
These numbers should be approached with caution because of a degree of inaccuracy in the FHA CHUMS
data.9
Figure 5 shows that Colorado and Arkansas have the relatively highest penetration of FHA EEMs, when the
data are normalized by the number of FHA loans in the state, at 2.3% each. California (1.3%) and Mississippi
(1.2%) have FHA/EEMs penetration near the national average. Normalized penetration rates of FHA
EEMs inVirginia (0.9%), Alaska (0.8%),10 and Vermont (0.6%) are the lowest among the pilot states, at least
based on the FHA CHUMS data.

8

FHA penetration varies by state, and FHA data alone are not the only indicator of EEM activity. Certain
states, most notably Alaska and Vermont, have state energy efficiency financing programs and FHA EEMs are not a
significant component of energy efficiency financing in these states.
9

There are problems with the accuracy of EEMs reporting in the FHA CHUMS database. For a detailed
explication of these problems, see Farhar, Collins, and Walsh (1997), pp. 47-48. The problems include lack of
training for underwriters and others in properly recording EEMs. The net result is that EEMs are both under- and
overreported; that is, some loans that are not actually EEMs are counted as EEMs, and some loans that are actually
EEMs are not counted as EEMs. The magnitude of the error in each direction remains unknown, but may balance
itself out, according to one HUD official.
10

The data for the AHFC EEMs are not included because they are not FHA EEMs and would not be
counted in the CHUMS data base. If both FHA and AHFC EEMS were counted, 8.7% of all loans in Alaska would
be EEMs.

*AHFC ratings and AHFC EEMs only; italicized figures do not include ERH-AK ratings nor FHA EEMs.
**See Table A-2 in Appendix A.

11

The relationship between the number of ratings and the number of EEMs is approximate only, because
ratings are reported on a calendar year (CY) basis, and mortgages on a fiscal year (FY) basis.

9

In most of the pilot states, many more ratings are being completed than are apparently being used for FHA
EEMs. Although HERS are required by FHA for EEMs to be issued, many EEMs are apparently being issued
without ratings, at least from the HERS provider organizations in the state of mortgage issue.12 The best
available data show that in Arkansas and Mississippi, more EEMs are being reported than there are ratings
being completed.13 Several factors could affect these counts. As noted earlier, there are EEMs reporting
problems in the CHUMS data system. Also, there may be inaccuracies in the rating data reported by the pilot
states. In addition, the two kinds of data are off by six months. Nevertheless, these are the only data available
on the incidence of EEMs in the nation and in the HERS/EEMs pilot states.
The EEMs offered through the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, with a quarter-point interest break, are
apparently the most successful EEMs being offered in the pilot states. The AHFC program completed 4,000
and committed $13.8 million for interest rate reductions on EEMs during the past three years, because the
AHFC program was separated from the ERH-AK program. The AHFC has markedly increased the number
of its mortgage loans for energy-improved housing. Table 2 shows the number of loans and interest rate
reductions achieved.

12

Some of the ratings used in EEMs could have been done in prior years or by organizations other than the
HERS provider organizations studies, which would affect the counts. For example, if the National Home Energy
Resources Organization (N-HERO) performed a rating for a California home that was ultimately used to qualify a
California borrower for an EEM, this rating would not be included in the count of ratings for California.
Nevertheless, based on anecdotal information, the impact of the N-HERO ratings on the numbers of ratings and
EEMs reported for each pilot state is estimated to be small.
13

The Colorado HERS program director reports anecdotal information that homeowners may use rating
information to decide on the best energy improvements without obtaining mortgages to make the improvements.

10

Raters
As noted, home energy raters are generally trained and certified by the operating HERS. Typically, home
energy raters have backgrounds in the housing or energy fields and include experience as home inspectors,
appraisers, energy auditors, low-income weatherization contractors, and energy-efficient home builders and
designers. The HERS programs had to train and certify raters to accurately complete ratings, as well as educate
customers. In the past three years, 69 additional raters were added to the pool of trained raters, for a total of
328 raters in the seven pilot states. Table 3 presents the data for the number of raters in 1995 and again in
1998.14 Rater training, in most cases, takes one week of classroom work, field activities, and testing.
Responsibility for rater certification varies by state. Depending on location, some raters are able to work full
time, but this is the exception rather than the rule. The number of raters is lower than the number trained
because not all of those trained and certified actively conduct ratings. In most cases, raters work independently
of the HERS programs and receive referrals from them. Raters are also in competition with each other for
business.

Rating Software
When the pilot program began, the Energy Rated Homes of America HERS providers (all of the original five
pilot states except California) were using EZ Rater software. The HERS providers spent part of their resources
to develop technical rating guidelines and software (see Table 4).

14

The number of raters trained by the HERS provider organizations exceeds the number of active raters,
indicating that many trained raters do not stay active for long.

11

Rating software has improved over the past five years because of the advent of rating software package testing
using Building Energy Simulation Test (BESTEST) to determine their accuracy in measuring the variables
they purported to measure (Judkoff and Neymark 1995a, b, c). The most recently developed software package
in the pilot states, Colorado’s Rating Management Software (RMS), completed during 1999, is built around
DOE-2.15

Marketing, Training, and Education
The HERS providers spent part of their resources to market both ratings and EEMs, and to develop the
infrastructure needed in the marketplace for an effective HERS/EEMs program (see Table 5). The HERS
provider organizations provided data on the housing industry professionals they trained during the course of
the pilot program, for which they have data. These numbers should be viewed in the context of state population
and size of professional group (where information is available) and may include some double counting.
Training ranges from an hour-long presentation at a conference to a three-hour course for continuing-education
credit, to a week-long course resulting in certification by a trade association or state agency.
HUD also provided training to lenders and underwriters responsible for preparing and approving EEMs in the
pilot states. HUD routinely trains underwriters on newly issued mortgagee letters. In addition, the California

15

DOE-2 is a whole building energy daylighting and simulation program that calculates energy loads,
interior temperatures, and interior illuminance from daylight for each hour of the year. The program can be used on
multi-zone buildings and uses annual hourly weather data for many locations. DOE-2.1E-W54 was one of three
programs that were used to generate the reference results in the BESTEST method. The other two reference
programs were BLAST 3.0 Level 215 and SERIRES/SUNCODE 5.7. These three programs are among the most
sophisticated for modeling heat transfer in buildings in the United States, and they have been subjected to numerous
validation exercises sponsored by DOE and the International Energy Agency.

12

and Virginia HUD field offices were particularly proactive in reaching out to train lenders and raters on EEMs
and the possibilities of incorporating energy-efficient improvements in its 203(k) rehabilitation loans.
These marketing, training, and education efforts absorbed a good deal of HERS program resources and staff
time, yet they were essential to achieving market penetration of the HERS/EEMs program.

Technical Assistance and Ratings in Nonpilot States
DOE funded several of the HERS providers to provide technical assistance to other states on how they could
establish or make available home energy ratings in their own locales. As of July 1999, home energy ratings
were available in 47 states and the District of Columbia through programs including Energy Rated Homes of
America and its affiliates, National HERO, Virginia HERO, several independent HERS programs, and a
variety of services developed for California. This represents an increase of 30 states since the summer of 1993,
before the HERS/EEMs pilot program began (Plympton 2000, Farhar and Eckert 1993).16

Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia (Farhar and Eckert 1993).

13

Funding the Pilot Programs
Sources of Funding for HERS Programs in the HERS/EEMs Pilot States
HERS programs’ funding sources vary considerably. In California, for example, utilities provided most of the
early CHEERS program funding (from 1993-1995), whereas in Alaska and Colorado, state energy offices were
the primary supporters of the HERS programs. DOE supported each of the HERS programs for the duration
of the five-year pilot for the original five EEMs pilot states (Alaska, Arkansas, California, Vermont, and
Virginia) beginning in FY 1994, and added funding support for Colorado and Mississippi in FY 1996. Other
sources of funding include, for example, ratings/dues/sales, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
(for data base development and evaluation research), and state funds.
The annual budgets for the HERS programs vary considerably by state, from a low of $133,709 in Arkansas
to a high of $1,235,000 in Colorado for FY 1998. Table A-1 (in Appendix A) presents detailed information.

Prospects of HERS Program Continuation
DOE has been supporting the HERS/EEMs pilot programs for five years, and the funding concluded in
FY 1999. The FY 2000 federal budget does not contain funding for further HERS/EEMs pilot state activities.
In light of this cessation of federal funding, those pilot programs with diversified funding sources are in a
better position to continue their operations than those who are not. Table 6 presents the data on DOE funding
as a percentage of HERS/EEMs pilot programs’ FY 1998 operating budgets, the most recent data available.

Costs of Ratings
It has been found in the pilot states that the charges for the ratings do not cover the costs of providing them.
Prices charged for ratings range from a low of $200 in Colorado to a high of $350 in Alaska and Vermont (see
Table 7). Although data are incomplete, it appears that all of the HERS provider organizations lose money each
time they process a rating, ranging from a reported $5 loss in Mississippi for each rating to a $565 loss per
rating in Virginia. These losses must be made up by other sources of funds, usually DOE funding, to keep the
HERS programs solvent.

*Data are unavailable.
**Only the ERH-AK program data show each rating as profitable, earning as much as $240
per rating above cost. However, this result may be a function of the way in which ERH-AK
calculated the internal cost of the rating. Other HERS providers—for example, Energy Rated
Homes of Colorado—reported all of their administrative costs in delivering the rating
program and divided by the number of ratings delivered to derive a dollar cost per rating.
ERH-AK only counted a small portion of its budget as a cost of processing ratings. If it had
used the same method used by other HERS providers, ERH-AK would have reported the
cost per rating as approximately $663, with the loss per rating at approximately $463.
***V-HERO receives a $50 fee from the rater for each rating.

Economic Prosperity
The median household income of the state in which the HERS program operates was identified by some HERS
program directors as a barrier to market penetration. Table 8 shows the median household income for the pilot
states. The two states with the lowest median household income are Arkansas and Mississippi. HERS programs
in these states appear to be having the most difficulty in diversifying their funding sources.

Program Descriptions
These descriptions of the HERS/EEMs pilot state programs are based on interviews and materials provided
by the HERS provider organizations over the course of the evaluation work commenced in 1994 and most
recently updated in 1999.

Alaska
Alaska has the oldest statewide HERS program, established in 1984. The AHFC, the ERH-AK, the state
energy office, the Alaska Craftsman Home Program, the Alaska Home Builders Association, and Anchorage
Municipal Light and Power were instrumental in establishing home energy ratings in the state. Throughout
its duration, the Alaska program’s focus has been on new construction. Approximately 90% of Alaska’s new
homes are now being rated. Alaska has enjoyed the support of its home builders for the duration of the
HERS/EEMs pilot program.
In 1992, all state energy office housing programs were merged in the AHFC. In 1993, HUD selected Alaska
as a pilot state for the FHA EEMs program, in part because of its established HERS program. In 1994,
ERH-AK formed as a nonprofit corporation. The HUD/FHA Anchorage Field Office was active in promoting
the EEMs pilot program.
In 1996, AHFC and ERH-AK parted contractual company and offered competing HERS programs in Alaska.
AHFC contracted with the Alaska Building Science Network to train raters and provide other HERS program
services. The AHFC also established an interest rate reduction for energy efficiency for home buyers who
obtain an AHFC loan. The amount of reduction increases with the efficiency of the home. A description of the
program is included in Appendix C.
Forty percent of new homes in Alaska are financed by AHFC. To obtain an AHFC low-interest loan, a new
home must prove compliance with the state’s Building Energy Efficiency Standard (BEES). A rating is one
of three approved methods to prove compliance and 90% of new housing receives an energy rating. Even if
the current buyers do not receive an AHFC loan, future buyers will need the rating documentation should they
wish to apply for an AHFC loan. Also, AHFC’s interest-rate reductions are additive, so for example, a firsttime homebuyer of an energy-efficient home who is also a veteran might receive an interest rate as low as
4.5%.
ERH-AK provides ratings, housing industry education, consumer marketing, and other infrastructure services.
The HERS provider also works on issues of national uniformity in ratings, national infrastructure development,
technical assistance to other states, national accreditation standards, and development and marketing of home
improvement loans (not mortgages or home equity loans) for energy efficiency. ERH-AK’s work on national
issues has been carried out through ERHA’s states and through RESNET, a nationwide network on
HERS/EEMs originally conceived in Alaska and supported in its early development in part by the EPA.

17

ERH-AK has worked to develop the low-interest ERH Loan for home improvements,17 which it expects to
market through all of the ERHA states. ERH-AK plans to expand its loan programs to provide income for the
rating program.
The ERH-AK director reports that ERH-AK took the lead in working toward national uniformity. According
to ERH-AK, the pilot states have a goal of creating a national HERS industry that would reach a “critical
mass” of market penetration nationwide. This includes increasing awareness that ratings are available and that
they provide benefits through linking with EEMs. ERH-AK says that the DOE funding for the HERS/EEMs
pilot states enabled it to progress toward a national HERS industry.
Successes in national uniformity cited by ERH-AK include the establishment of RESNET accreditation
standards and the accreditation of 22 rating organizations using these standards. ERH-AK says that National
Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO)/RESNET took the HERS Council technical HERS guidelines,
updated them, and recently published them on the RESNET site. These successes are claimed by ERH-AK
as, at least in part, a result of the DOE funding of the HERS provider organizations in the pilot states.
Appendix D presents an example of the “rule of thumb” characteristics of a five-star home in new construction
in Alaska, as described by the ERH-AK program.

Arkansas
The Arkansas Energy Office (AEO) was instrumental in establishing the ERH-AR in 1986. ERH-AR had close
ties with ERHA because the two office were directed by the same individual and were both located in Little
Rock. In March 1993, Arkansas legislation charged the AEO with responsibility to develop and implement
an EEMs pilot program; in May, HUD/FHA selected Arkansas as one of the original five EEMs pilot states
authorized under the 1992 EPACT. In January 1994, the organization was separated from ERHA and a new
director was named. A third program director assumed the program’s leadership in 1998.
ERH-AR administers the statewide rating system as a nonprofit HERS provider organization to assist the AEO
in its energy education and efficiency programs. The program provides energy ratings and inspections for new
and existing homes, blower door tests, and HERS quality assurance. In addition, ERH-AR facilitates EEMs
and certifies homes for the EPA’s ENERGY STAR Homes Program and also provides radon test kits. Beyond
Arkansas, the program provides services in Oklahoma, Missouri, and Texas.
The rating program was marketed in Little Rock on television spots on Channels 4, 7, and 11 from February
24 through April 2, 1998. ERH-AR also distributes brochures on blower door tests and “Five Easy Steps” and
“How to Get the Home You Want”—guides to energy-efficient mortgages. Appendix E presents information
from ERH-AR brochures designed for Arkansas residents.
ERH-AR deals with a larger proportion of substandard housing stock than some of the other pilot states,
coupled with higher utility bills and lower median income. These housing-market realities make it challenging
for the rating program to market its services. Nevertheless, the ERH-AR director believes that HERS/EEMs
is a winning program for the state because it creates, at least theoretically, jobs for raters and contractors, sales

17

Eligible improvements are furnaces, boilers, gas conversions, windows, refrigerators, washers, dryers,
insulation, roofing, siding, room additions, doors, water heaters, and any energy improvements recommended by an
ERH rater.

18

for builders, larger commissions for real estate professionals, more and larger mortgages for lenders, and lower
operating costs for homeowners.
ERH-AR located one lender in NationsBank in St. Louis, Missouri, who has built his success in lending
through making EEMs his specialty. This led to more ERH-AR activity in Missouri.
The ERH-AR program director believes the program has been seriously underfunded, and indeed, its 1998
budget, $133,709, was the lowest of the seven pilot states. This funding level was approximately 10% of the
California and Colorado budgets for 1998. The HERS program relied almost exclusively on DOE funding to
sustain itself.
The ERH-AR changed management direction in 1998 from a program that relied almost completely on federal
funding to one that now emphasizes self-sufficiency. Although 1998 was a relatively late start on the pilot
program’s new goal, the program director believes ERH-AR has accomplished a great deal considering its
funding constraints.

California
In the mid-1980s, the California Energy Commission (CEC) began testing HERS in the state. In 1990, Pacific
Gas and Electric (PG&E) requested the CEC’s support and participation in establishing a statewide HERS
program. CHERS, Inc., a consortium of gas and electric utilities, was established that year, and through its
auspices, CHEERS—the software used for ratings in California—was completed.
Appendix F exhibits excerpts from a CHEERS program brochure advertising benefits of a home energy rating
such as decreased utility bills, increased value of the home, and helping to preserve the environment.
In September 1992, California legislation was passed requiring the CEC to develop criteria for a statewide
HERS program. The CEC provided training and education for real estate professionals, lenders, and appraisers
on the 2% stretch loan and on benefits of EEMs. The CEC also worked through the Building Industry Institute
(BII) to review HERS guideline and train the state’s home builders on EEMs. The BII contract is managed by
ConSol, Inc.
With utility restructuring on the horizon, PG&E, which had been the CHEERS program’s main supporter,
markedly reduced its funding in 1996. The program’s funding has been augmented by the fees charged for
ratings, other utility funding, the CEC, and DOE.
California now has competition among HERS providers—seven organizations perform ratings, including
CHEERS; Consumer Energy Management Consulting; ConSol, Inc.; EEMs, Inc.; Federal Energy Services;
H&L Energy Savers; and Rated Energy Plus. The CEC wants to use Title 24, which is a performance building
code, to improve housing efficiency (see below). The CEC is currently working with the building industry and
other interested parties to develop a performance-based HERS that is compatible with both Title 24 and
national guidelines. ConSol, Inc., currently providing HERS ratings for new homes in California and Nevada,
believes that the real value in the rating is access to financing and that rating can work with Title 24.

19

Title 24
California’s Title 24 is a performance code based on a systems analysis of a home’s projected energy use
(space and water heating, and space cooling). Title 24 results in a pass/fail decision on a building permit
application. California has been divided into 16 climate zones by the CEC; for each climate zone, Title 24
identifies a set of prescriptive requirements for insulation, water heating, windows, furnace, air conditioning,
glazing, and shading. Using a software program called MICROPAS, for instance, builders can use a computer
performance approach to demonstrate that their designs use no more energy than they would if built with the
prescriptive features. Builders’ energy consultants typically prepare “paper” (but not computer-generated)
documentation for Title 24 compliance for proposed homes, which is then reviewed by building officials. A
difficulty in actually achieving efficiency lies in the differences between the features claimed in the systems
analysis calculations and the actual features installed.
Starting July 1999, Title 24 provides optional credit for tight ducts and low air infiltration. These credits, which
builders can trade for other features such as increased window area, require blower door and duct blaster tests.
For the builder to use the credit, the installer must test and certify each home and an independent, third-party
rater must randomly check the subdivision’s homes.
HERS
HERS can improve the quality of construction. The HERS rating system being used in California for new
homes by ConSol and by other CHEERS raters, is based on the MICROPAS software that can also be used
to demonstrate compliance with the Title 24 energy efficiency standards. This provides a potential link between
Title 24 and HERS.
CHEERS currently receives plan submittals from the analyst, which it stores for later verification. After the
home has been constructed, the CHEERS field rater sends verification of the energy features to CHEERS.
After CHEERS receives the inspection data, it sends the rating certificate, which includes the lot number and
address, to the rater. CHEERS provides training, oversight, and quality assurance for diagnostics and ratings.
CHEERS has been approved by the CEC as a HERS provider and can certify raters. (Prior to July 1999, raters
were not certified in California.) After July 1999, uncertified raters are not allowed to perform diagnostics for
Title 24 credit in California. In the future, certification will also be required for all ratings. A proceeding began
in July 1999 to define the technical and computer modeling requirements for HERS in California.
Title 24 and HERS
In recent DOE-funded training in the state, it was found that 75% of the documents for Title 24 compliance
were incorrect. The typical home is 7% less efficient than the Title 24 code requires. BII encouraged builders
to train their personnel and have third-party inspections as a means to improve compliance with Title 24. In
addition, ConSol believes there should be a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning design and layout, an
initial inspection during the rough frame, and a second inspection at the end of construction to ensure that
energy efficiency features are installed properly and will result in a comfortable and efficient home. ConSol
believes that if amenities are equal, home buyers will choose a more efficient house as certified by a home
energy rating. But without standardized ratings, customers are unable to differentiate among the home rating,
brand, and options packages.

20

Market Value of HERS
HERS can improve the quality of construction. If builders can reduce their litigation exposure because their
homes are comfortable, they can invest the savings in improved housing quality. The most frequent complaint
in litigation is water intrusion; the second most frequent complaint is that home buyers cannot get warm or cool
enough. Energy-related quality improvements are embodied in increased comfort, which can also increase
customer referrals to the builder. The market value for a system using ratings might be captured through
reduced numbers of callbacks and reduced litigation for builders. The market value of HERS may also be
demonstrated if home buyers recognize energy efficiency in their home purchase decisions.
EEMs
Large production builders negotiate with lenders for mortgage interest rates, fee structure, and promotional
advantages, so EEMs have no effect on the mortgages for production homes. However, EEMs could be useful
because current lending processes do not take energy bills into account. According to ConSol, the latest
Freddie Mac EEMs guidelines require a rating; they do not require an appraiser form 70A (as was previously
the case). Norwest Bank, which provides EEMs in California, analyzed how a rating would change borrower
qualifications using a sample five-star rating that indicated a $26/month net savings. Norwest found that $26
was about a 1% stretch for mortgages under a $150,000 sales price; the loan would be approximately
$135,000. Norwest would either credit the utility savings on the debt-to-income ratio or allow the home buyer
to purchase $26/month more amenities for the home. To benefit their business, lenders want builders to qualify
more buyers or sell amenities options packages for larger loans.
Future Directions
The Title 24 code is evolving toward a performance code backed up by independent, on-site inspections. In
ConSol’s opinion, to maintain the integrity of the Title 24 system, a third party—a home energy rater—is
needed to test a random sample of the completed homes for production builders. The installer certifies the
installation of energy features. The CEC has recently approved rules for HERS providers and the testing
procedures. The computer modeling system for HERS is under development.

Colorado
Energy Rated Homes of Colorado (ERHC), established in 1995 as part of the ERHA network, has recently
experienced a change in program directors. The new director came from the Colorado Housing Finance
Agency, the organization within which the ERHC program currently resides. The Colorado HERS program
(called “E-Star Colorado”) was one of the more generously funded HERS programs in the nation, with a
budget above $1.2 million both in 1997 and in 1998.
ERHC trains, certifies, and maintains a statewide rater pool. It processes ratings for both existing homes and
new construction, maintaining quality control of ratings. A major program achievement has been the recent
development of the new RMS using a version of DOE-2 to produce ratings and to manage the flow of ratings
from the simulation engine to printing. RMS includes a management tool that tracks rater certification and
other administrative matters, such as education credits. Raters can enter rating data directly online. The
program allows for central processing of a large volume of rating and storage of output data in a central
database. ERHC will be able to sublicense the software, which can be used in all climate regimes nationwide.
The use of RMS should result in substantially reduced overhead costs for performing each rating.

21

ERHC has found, based on anecdotal information, that homeowners receiving ratings may not use them to
obtain mortgages for energy improvements, but often use ratings for information purposes. Energy
improvements may be made through regular home equity loans or without financing at all.
Barriers to the program include low utility rates, low interest rates for home mortgages, and lack of consumer
awareness. ERHC’s strategy from the outset has been to work closely with the Home Builders Association
through a green-builders training course and by offering builders a free home rating analysis of a home the
builder is constructing. This has been successful in the custom building market. Builders like to market
E-Star™ Homes as environmentally friendly. The program has also worked successfully with utility companies
and real estate professionals to market ratings. The program now has a high volume of ratings. Between 1995
and 1998, ERHC did 3,812 ratings, although this is a small percentage of the housing stock. Half of the ratings
are done in new construction and half in existing homes.
Raters need to charge about $250 per rating to make the visit financially feasible. They currently charge
customers $150 for each rating. ERHC provides raters with a $100 subsidy for each rating. The true cost of
each rating to ERHC, including program administration and marketing, has been approximately $650 to $700.
Appendix G presents information from ERHC brochures advertising how an E-StarTM certified home can
increase a homeowner’s home-buying power.
ERHC plans to diversify its revenue sources by charging raters an annual certification fee of $50 and charging
builders registration fees for becoming E-StarTM builders.

Mississippi
The Energy Rated Homes of Mississippi (ERHM) program was organized under the initiative of the
Mississippi Energy Office in 1994 to provide home energy ratings and promote energy-efficient mortgages
as a market-based, fuel-neutral activity as stipulated in EPACT. ERHM formed as a nonprofit organization
with a board of directors representing the interest of the housing industry, utility companies, and consumer
education groups. The program is staffed by an executive director, administrative assistant, rating director, and
rating processor. The program has certified six independent home energy raters in Mississippi and 11 in four
additional states.
ERHM has identified three markets that it wants to emphasize: (1) buyers of existing homes using an energy
improvement mortgage, (2) buyers of new homes using an energy-efficient mortgage and EPA ENERGY
STAR Home promotions, and (3) permanent homeowners wanting to improve the energy efficiency of their
homes. ERHM has moved toward diversifying services, increasing its emphasis on building codes and energy
codes, and working with builders and contractors on energy efficiency.
With limited consumer advertising dollars, ERHM has concentrated training and presentation efforts on
builders, lenders, real estate professionals, and other organizations. A continuing education course has been
designed for real estate professionals and appraisers. The organization has also worked to get utility companies
to co-sponsor events and advertising in conjunction with their homes.
ERHM contacts builders to explain how the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac mortgage pilot program can benefit
them. With a rating, builders can add value to their homes based on efficiency levels that are above those
achieved by standard construction practice. Until 1998, Mississippi borrowers had no access to national
mortgage lenders that were offering ENERGY STAR Mortgages. GMAC Mortgage Corporation, which

22

located in the state in 1998, formed a partnership with ERHM to promote energy efficiency by financing fourstar and five-star homes.
Mississippi has no enforced statewide building code nor a model energy code. The absence of both of these
codes impedes progress toward high standards of energy efficiency in the state’s housing. In typical
construction in Mississippi, no one knows who is responsible for the holes that are created for plumbing and
electrical access; therefore, no one takes responsibility for sealing these holes. However, ERHM is identifying
contractors who know the benefits of “airtight” practices and the program has worked with them to create an
“Energy Check” program for certified energy contractors.
In Mississippi, consumers remain unaware of energy efficiency and its benefits, and no enforced disclosure
is made concerning utility bills at the time of home sale. Moreover, Mississippi has the lowest per capita
income in the nation with high need for affordable and efficient housing. Although the potential is great, the
barriers are also significant.
ERHM has worked with other ERHA pilot programs to establish national uniformity of the rating system and
a national accreditation to further the recognition of HERS with builders and lenders. Additionally, ERHM
has received accreditation in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to initiate HERS activities
there. Accreditation is pending in Tennessee.
ERHM has developed a regional HERS program called Energy Rated Homes (ERH) of the South. ERH of the
South, through its contractual partner, Southface Energy Institute in Atlanta, has trained raters in other states
for a $350 fee, has certified raters for an annual sublicense fee of $120 (including of sublicense REMRate to
raters), and has collected a $50 fee per rating for recordkeeping and to pay for REMRate. ERHM believes that
ERH of the South will be able to sustain itself through fees collected.
ERHM has striven for high standards of professional conduct throughout its history. Appendix H presents the
Code of Ethics used by the ERHM program and its raters.

Vermont
HERS/EEMs activities began in 1986 with state allocation of petroleum violation escrow (PVE) funds to the
Vermont Department of Public Service to develop a program to finance energy improvements in housing. The
Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) took the program lead. In 1987, ERH-VT was incorporated as a
nonprofit to provide ratings and was housed in the VHFA offices. In 1993, HUD/FHA chose Vermont as an
EEMs pilot state. ERH-VT was also a Fannie Mae pilot state and the program partnered with utilities to
include builder incentives for energy efficiency construction. From 1994 to June 1999, ratings were being
incorporated into utility demand-side management programs.
The Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC), incorporated in 1986, became the organizational home
for ERH-VT in 1996. ERH-VT is currently a project within VEIC. This organizational arrangement fosters
diversification of services, and assists ERH-VT in becoming more self-sufficient.

23

The ERH-VT program director, believing that ratings need to be part of a larger strategy, has diversified the
services the program provides. By the end of 1998, ERH-VT was involved in the following activities:


Home energy ratings for new and existing home programs



Ratings for use in determining compliance with gas and electric utility new construction programs



Yearly Energy Savings System (YESS) mortgage program with VHFA, including a reduced interest rate
energy improvement mortgage for buyers of existing homes18 (Details are in Appendix I.)



Vermont Energy Mortgage Pilot Program through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac allowing for the 2%
stretch



FHA and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs EEMs



New construction five-star ratings for ENERGY STAR Homes



Ratings and contract management services subsidized by various Vermont utilities to facilitate financing
of new energy systems through energy improvement mortgages (EIMs)



Complete turnkey Energy Improvement Mortgage Services (including facilitation and contract
management) for home buyers



Ratings to determine compliance of new buildings with the Vermont Residential Energy Code.

The Vermont program has focused primarily on new construction. Barriers remain to use of ratings on existing
homes, including the reluctance of housing professionals to incorporate EEMs, regarded as an additional
“hassle,” into their daily practice. ERH-VT is working to overcome these barriers through its Energy
Improvement Mortgage Service, which provides such services as initial borrower consultation, lender
assistance and personalized training, and completion of all lender forms to access an EIM. The program
director believes that lenders will respond to this service.
As in other states, in Vermont the cost of performing a rating is higher than what the market will pay. In
Vermont, the VHFA offers a reduced interest rate mortgage called YESS, which rolls costs of energy
improvements into the mortgage. Borrowers can also use the 2% stretch or FHA and DVA EEMs, although
the 2% stretch loan is perceived as ineffective as long as the borrower has a good credit history because lenders
have the discretion to stretch debt-to-income ratios.
Vermont’s Multiple Listing Service now includes rating information on homes in its data sheets; appraisers
are being trained in the role of energy ratings’ impacts on home value. The program director believes, based
on anecdotal information, that a four-star home is worth $1,000 more than a three-star home. Also, the
Vermont energy code includes ERH-VT as one of the code compliance options for builders.
ERH-VT has worked closely with ERHA and NASEO/RESNET to build the HERS industry. ERH-VT was
accredited by the NASEO/RESNET mortgage industry accreditation committee. The HERS program has used

18

The rate changes periodically as funds are used up; the most recent rate was 5.2%.

24

its political connections to foster national legislation and appropriations for continued HERS industry support.
ERH-VT created the Northeast HERS Alliance to focus on ENERGY STAR Homes and on existing home
energy improvement financing in New England and New York. This Alliance provides technical and
marketing assistance on HERS/EEMs to other states in the region while working to develop accreditation
procedures for HERS providers.
To ensure its future self-sufficiency, ERH-VT has to collect fees for technical assistance on HERS/EEMs to
other states and must charge full fees for ratings and its turnkey service. The HERS program could also be
supported, in part, by income from its YESS loan program.

Virginia
In 1989, the Virginia Commonwealth Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy worked with ERHA to
develop a rating program for Virginia. The Commonwealth funded the start-up HERS program for two years
using PVE funds. By February 1993, the V-HERO was established as a nonprofit organization to train and
certify raters, perform ratings, and administer the rating program. In May 1993, HUD/FHA selected Virginia
as an EEMs pilot state. Dissatisfied with ERHA’s products and services, V-HERO separated itself and
developed its own training, marketing, and software products for rating. DOE funding for Virginia’s
HERS/EEMs program began in 1995.
Also in 1995, N-HERO was established as a Virginia corporation. N-HERO’s purpose is to make it
economically feasible to develop HERS services in other states without duplicating in-state programs with
inherent costs in every state. N-HERO provides management and other services for the V-HERO program
under a management contract and works to expand a rating system nationally in competition with ERHA and
others. The V-HERO program director also served as a board member of the national HERS Council since its
inception, and chaired the board for two years. The Commonwealth’s support for the program is documented
in a Virginia joint legislative resolution commending the program (see Appendix J).
V-HERO relies on the HERS Council’s technical guidelines for ratings. V-HERO funded development of
RateView, a rating software tool to replace ERHA’s EZ-Rater program, which V-HERO stopped using when
it withdrew from the ERHA program. V-HERO performs quality control for each rating checklist submitted
by raters, performs the ratings, and produces a rating report designed for use by lenders. The program also
ensures that conflicts of interest are avoided (such as raters acting as contractors for the retrofits recommended
in the ratings and a different rater performing the post-improvement inspection).
The V-HERO board analyzed the costs of performing ratings; their study found that ratings cost far more to
provide than homeowners are willing to pay. The board recommended that V-HERO diversify its services and
increase volume of ratings to bring down cost per rating. This caused V-HERO to emphasize self-sufficiency
as a program goal. A significant rationale for N-HERO’s formation was to provide profit-producing services
in the marketplace to offset the cost of providing rating services. Profits from N-HERO were intended to be
used to support V-HERO if federal funding for the HERS program is not renewed.
V-HERO has heavily emphasized marketing to the general public through media and used television
advertising more extensively than other HERS/EEMs pilot programs. However, the V-HERO program says
it needs more resources for marketing or needs a federal nationwide marketing program. V-HERO also
established a financial incentive contest for lenders in the Commonwealth, offering $2,000 to the lender who
produces the highest number of EEMs. The program also forged linkages with other HERS/EEMs
infrastructure members (such as appraisers, HUD/FHA staff, home builders, and real estate professionals).

25

V-HERO claims to have rated and improved more than 18,000 homes, resulting in 30% to 60% reductions in
energy use with concomitant greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The HERS program has trained and
certified 125 raters. The V-HERO program assists the Virginia Environmental Protection Agency in reaching
compliance for emissions abatement and clean air standards. In addition, V-HERO has long been concerned
with housing affordability and assists in bringing quality improvements to inner-city construction along with
cost savings of almost half on utility bills.

26

Future Actions and Needs:
Views of the Pilot State HERS Providers
The pilot state HERS providers expressed their views of the role that the federal government should play in
the future relative to the development of a national system of EEMs linked with HERS. Each organization says
it is unlikely to or will not survive without federal funding. Some of the ERHA members want funding to come
to them via ERHA. Even HERS providers with diversified funding sources express a need for federal
funding.19
Consumer demand for and willingness to pay for ratings is not high enough in the pilot states to support a
HERS industry. Also, the cost of delivering ratings is higher than the fees charged for ratings, resulting in a
net loss to the HERS programs for each rating performed.
In addition to federal funding, the HERS provider organizations themselves suggest several federal actions they
believe are necessary to maintain the HERS industry. Three major themes emerge from their discussions on
this point. In addition to continued federal funding of the pilot HERS provider organizations, the HERS
providers define the need for a federal role as follows.




Federal energy efficiency tax credits
Federally mandated use of HERS for EPA’s ENERGY STAR Homes program
A federally supported marketing and public information campaign.

Use of HERS for Energy Efficiency Tax Credits
The HERS providers support a tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements in housing. They call for
requiring a HERS rating for taxpayers’ energy improvements in housing to ensure efficacy and to qualify for
the tax credit.

Use of HERS for EPA’s ENERGY STAR Homes Program
HERS providers believe EPA should require home energy ratings for each house labeled as an ENERGY
STAR Home, thus helping to assure markets for their services. Until recently, EPA has required that its
ENERGY STAR Homes label be used only on new homes that had been rated as 86 or higher on the home
energy rating scale. Builders have expressed concern about the cost of providing ratings for each new home.
In response, EPA has developed a set of builder option packages (BOPs) that builders can use to obtain
ENERGY STAR certification. These BOPs comprise a checklist of energy improvements EPA believes would
bring the home to the equivalent of an 86 rating, representing a prescriptive approach to home energy rating
and labeling, rather than the performance-based approach adopted by the National HERS/EEMs Collaborative
in 1992 and legislated in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. However, HERS providers believe that EPA should
continue to require home energy ratings for each house labeled as an ENERGY STAR Home to ensure that
the house meets efficiency standards (Plympton 2000).

19

The Virginia Home Energy Rating Organization said that no further federal funding should come to the
HERS/EEMs pilot states at the end of the five-year pilot program.

27

Federally Supported Energy Efficiency Marketing Campaign
HERS program directors suggest that a federal program to advertise HERS/EEMs and to educate customers
about the benefits of home energy ratings and energy-efficient mortgages—as well as about energy efficiency
generally—would help increase demand for their services. Although one HERS provider disagrees, increased
demand could potentially help them become more self-sufficient by reducing rating cost through increased
volume. Several of the HERS program directors note they have insufficient funds to adequately advertise their
programs and educate homeowners and home buyers in order to increase demand for their services. Program
directors find that customer demand increases with the level and type of advertising. Television spots, for
example, appear to stimulate many customer calls. But educating the public and advertising the programs
enough to further stimulate the markets is beyond the budgetary resources of the HERS provider organizations.

28

Discussion
The HERS providers in the pilot states were funded by DOE to provide technical assistance on HERS program
development to states without HERS programs. Their efforts have been, in part, realized. In 1993—before the
pilots began—rating services were available in all or parts of 17 states (Farhar and Eckert 1993). By 1999, that
number had increased to 47 states and the District of Columbia. Regional HERS are in development in the
Northeast, Midwest, and South. Nationwide, approximately 500 trained and certified raters are employed fullor part-time.

Factors Appearing to Affect Program Operations
Several factors appear to affect HERS program operations. Although each HERS/EEMs pilot program offers
a unique story, there may be some common themes. The evaluation research has yielded observations on the
following themes:







High levels of funding over relatively short time periods
State-funded financial incentives for energy efficiency financing for mortgage borrowers
Financial incentive for lenders to market EEMs
Diversification of services
Continuity in HERS program leadership
Active involvement of key stakeholders.

Table 9 summarizes the positions of the HERS programs on these factors.
High Levels of Funding
HERS programs in Alaska, California, and Colorado each received high levels of funding during short periods
of time ($8.5 million in FY 1993–FY 1995 in Alaska; $3.2 million in California in FY 1993–FY 1995 as well
as annual funding exceeding $1 million; and $2.5 million in Colorado in FY1997–FY1998). These funding
“spurts” undoubtedly assisted the HERS programs.
State-funded Financial Incentives for Energy Efficiency Financing for Mortgage Borrowers
A slight interest rate break for EEMs (on the order of a quarter-point mortgage interest rate reduction) could
make them more attractive to borrowers (although the incentive to lenders of offering an interest rate break is
unclear). The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation offers such an interest rate break, with 1,151 loans being
completed in 1998. (In contrast, only 32 EEMS were completed in Alaska in 1998.) The new YESS program
in Vermont also offers an interest rate reduction to energy-efficient mortgage borrowers.
Financial Incentives for Lenders to Market EEMs
V-HERO offered a $2,000 recognition award for the lender completing the highest number of EEMs in
Virginia in 1998; 375 EEMs—a relatively high number—were completed in Virginia using ratings from the
V-HERO program that year. This observation suggests that aggressive marketing of EEMs by the mortgage
community may be important to increasing the number of EEMs achieved, and that a financial incentive for
lenders could increase lender marketing efforts.

Diversification of Services
Vermont’s program has been incorporated into a larger entity (a nonprofit organization) and offers a suite of
services, including home energy ratings, a turnkey service for lenders, code compliance documentation, and
appraiser training. The Virginia program offers several services, including consulting on inner-city housing
affordability, development of innovative energy-efficiency financing products, and financial incentives for
lenders. Mississippi’s program also offers several services, including “EnergyCheck,” a checklist of viable
energy efficiency options for the homeowner. Organizations that combine their home energy rating services
with other energy efficiency, housing, and mortgage lending services may increase the probably of their
viability without federal funding. Packaging services appears to have three aspects: (1) diversification of
services to add value that the market recognizes and is willing to pay for, (2) sharing of administrative costs
so that the incremental cost of each rating processed is reduced, and (3) reducing per-unit rating cost through
working with large production builders to increase their quality assurance. Such diversification may help
HERS programs to survive without continued federal funding.
Continuity in HERS Program Leadership
Continuity in program leadership, combined with experienced HERS program leaders, appears to be another
key factor in sustained operation. Alaska, Vermont, and Virginia had the same managers for the duration of
the five-year pilot program, which appears to have strengthened each of these programs. The remaining pilot
states have experienced major shifts in leadership, which could have cost them some momentum.

30

Active Stakeholder Involvement
The extent of stakeholder involvement appears to be another factor. The two least-populated states appear to
have completed, proportionally, the most ratings. This may be, at least in part, a function of a smaller state’s
greater opportunities for interaction among the prominent stakeholders in the energy, building, housing
finance, lending, real estate, appraisal, government, and rating-provider communities. The active participation
of key stakeholders appears to enhance a program’s effectiveness in completing ratings. Such participation may
take longer in more populous states.
Other Observations
Economic prosperity, as measured by a state’s median income, does not appear to be strongly associated with
the number of ratings completed. Ranked in order by median income, the HERS/EEMs pilot states are (see
also Table 8):

5. Vermont—Medium
6. Arkansas—Low
7. Mississippi—Low.

Housing markets are booming in several of the pilot states, notably in California and Colorado. In these
circumstances, mortgage lenders are already so busy that they do not seem to need to differentiate themselves
by offering EEMs, which is a special service requiring more effort on their part. Demand for HERS/EEMs may
be dampened in times of housing boom, which appears to militate against a positive effect for HERS/EEMs
because of a state’s higher economic prosperity. On the other hand, Alaska, with relatively high economic
prosperity, used state funds and rating fees to fund its AHFC program, resulting in more ratings.
EEM program advocates on the HUD field office staff, especially in California and Virginia, had a positive
impact on HERS/EEMs operations—proactively reaching out to lenders, real estate professionals, HERS
provider organizations, and consumers.

Recommendations for HERS Programs
Based on the data collected from the HERS/EEMs pilot program providers and the observations emerging from
the program evaluation, the following recommendations appear to offer the best possibilities for HERS
programs to continue without federal subsidies.20


Ratings are routinely used as an integral part of EPA’s ENERGY STAR Homes Program to qualify houses
for an ENERGY STAR label.



HERS programs integrate themselves with agencies or other organizational entities (nonprofit or for-profit)
to help reduce administrative costs.



HERS programs evolve into one part of a package of services for which the market is willing to pay.

20

The pilot state HERS provider organizations might not completely agree with all of the items listed.

31



HERS programs work with large production builders on quality assurance to reduce transaction costs per
rating provided.



HERS programs partner with financial institutions to offer loans to pay for recommended energy
improvements, and use the income generated to help support the rating program.

Recommendations for Future Research and Analysis
Even though the HERS/EEMs pilot states program has been completed, significant questions remain about
the financing of energy-efficient new housing and of energy efficiency improvements in existing housing. For
example, no data exist on the energy conservation measures that have been installed through the program. In
addition, no data currently exist on the amounts actually loaned for energy efficiency improvements—that is,
the percentages of the total EEMs made that was used to pay for energy features. This sort of information
would be helpful in increasing understanding about the market for types of energy efficiency improvements
and, therefore, the marketing of EEMs products.
Peer-reviewed analysis on the impact of EEMs on mortgage loan performance is still lacking. This critical
question has been identified as the core issue by the mortgage community in its design and use of EEMs
products. Analysis will depend, in part, on the availability of accurate data in the databases of the federal
government and the secondary mortgage markets. The lack of data has prevented this question from being
addressed. Until the question of default has been credibly addressed, the mortgage community may remain
hesitant to aggressively market EEMs.
Recommendations for consumer education about the need for and benefits of energy efficiency are frequently
made. Although consumer education is undoubtedly necessary to support the demand for energy-efficient
homes and energy improvements in existing housing, it is not sufficient to bring about significant changes in
the marketplace. Energy-efficient housing must be credibly labeled. Research is needed to ascertain the most
useful form of and mechanism for energy efficiency labeling for housing—both new and existing—so that
potential buyers, lenders, real estate professionals, and appraisers can rely on the energy information presented.
Finally, the actual impact of EEMs-financed homes on energy cost savings should be analyzed to determine
the energy and cost savings, as well as positive environmental effects, as a result of the programs.

32

Conclusions
There have been major advances in HERS and EEMs since the passage of EPACT in 1992. In part because
of HERS pilot state activity, home energy ratings are now available in 47 states and the District of Columbia
and EEMs are offered nationwide by several national lenders. Rating software has improved technically during
the pilot test. Many states have benefited from the regional approach taken by several of the pilot states. Of
the 43 nonpilot states, 30 states report agreements with HERS programs in other states and 17 report having
active HERS programs in place. Accomplishments during the five years of the pilot program include
completion of more than 63,000 home energy ratings and of 8,534 EEMs worth a total of more than $902
million.
The HERS programs that have resulted in the most HERS/EEMs activity are those that have:


Obtained high levels of funding from several sources over relatively short time periods



Offered state-funded financial incentives for energy efficiency financing for mortgage borrowers



Offered financial incentives for lenders to market EEMs



Operated within a larger entity and offer other energy services along with ratings



Maintained continuity in HERS program leadership



Actively involved key stakeholders in housing finance, ratings, real estate, building, government, and
related communities.

These strategies appear to help HERS programs to become more financially self-sufficient. The best prospects
for self-sufficiency appear to involve locating the programs within another organization and diversifying
energy efficiency services. States may opt to fund HERS programs to keep them operational.
Improved market demand would assist HERS programs. Although there is some EEMs activity in the pilot
states, the mortgage community has not fully embraced HERS/EEMs. The 2% debt-to-income ratio stretch
offered by the conventional mortgage markets—which existed prior to the HERS/EEMs pilots—is, by itself,
inadequate to increase market demand for HERS/EEMs. If a 2% ratio stretch were added to the ratio stretch
already within discretion of mortgage lenders, more incentive might exist. Interest rate reductions for EEMs
could also increase demand, although the rationale for such reductions has not been established by the
mortgage community. Increased mortgage community commitment to and marketing of EEMs would enhance
the prospects of HERS programs.
After five years and $4.2 million in federal funding overall, it appears that most of the HERS programs in the
pilot states will find it difficult to remain operational without outside support. The situation for the HERS
programs is made more difficult by the fact that each rating they process actually costs them more resources
than it brings in. However, by diversifying services, increasing volume while decreasing rating costs, reducing
transaction costs, reducing administrative costs, and charging fees for service, the programs may be able to
continue offering ratings well into the future.

Appendix C. Alaska Housing Finance Corporation
Interest Rate Reduction for Energy Efficiency
Home buyers who obtain an Alaskan Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) loan may qualify for an interest
rate reduction, depending on the energy efficiency of the home.

In addition to the improvements resulting in a “step increase” in the energy rating, the improvements must
increase the rating by a minimum of 5 points for each applicable reduction in rate. For example, an urban area
home has an existing rating of 44 and the efficiency must increase by 6 points to move to the next step. This
improvement would result in an interest rate reduction of 1/4% because both the “step increase test” and the
“point increase test” were met. However, if the existing home had an initial energy rating at 47 points, the
improvement would have to increase the rating to 52 points before a 1/4% rate reduction would be available
(even though the next step would have required only a point value of 50). If a home is eligible for a 2 Step
increase and a resultant rate reduction of 1/2%, the points also would have to increase by at least 10 to be
eligible for the full 1/2% rate reduction. It is important to realize that the rate reduction applies only when an
improvement results in a step increase and a minimum point increase of 5 for each step.
Regardless of the availability of natural gas or the age of the dwelling (new construction or existing), rate reductions
are subject to a maximum loan of $175,000 on properties located in areas not meeting the definition of a small
community and $200,000 on properties located in areas meeting the definition of a small community.

Appendix E. Energy Rated Homes of Arkansas Brochure

Because you live
in Arkansas . . .

The Call . . .

. . . and Arkansas is one of five states selected by
the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development to test its new FHA Energy
Efficient Mortgage, you have the opportunity to
improve your level of comfort and your lifestyle!

The Rating . . .

The HUD FHA Energy Efficient Mortgage
allows you, at the time of purchase of an existing
home, to finance aditional dollars for energy
improvements on the basis that the savings on
your monthly energy bills will meet or exceed the
extra amount you pay monthly for the cost of the
improvements.
Improvements may include such things as the
replacement of outmoded heating equipment, the
installation of central air, increased insulation,
more efficient window systems, duct repair and
sealing, etc.
All of these improvement will be recommended
by your rating report to make your home more
comfortable to live in, lower your utility bills, and
put extra money in your pocket.
Your loan officer will help you through the
process of obtaining and fulfilling the terms of the
HUD FHA Energy Efficient Mortgage, and all with
no delay or additional qualification procedures
than if you were obtaining an ordinary FHA loan.
Basically, there are five easy steps . . .

48

1. Contact a participating lender. Ask your
bank if they are an FHA approved lender. If
they are not, contact your local HUD/FHA
office for a list of approved lenders.

2. Obtain a home energy rating. Obtain
analysis from an energy rater for the house you
plan to purchase or refinance. Contact your state
energy office or energy raters.

The Lender . . .
3. Provider energy rating to lender. Use the
rating recommendations to select the costeffective improvements. Provide your home
energy rating and list of improvements to your
lender for approval. Improvements will be
inspected before funds are releasted from
escrow. Up to $250 may be financed for the
initial and final inspections.

The Loan . . .
4. Close loan and install improvements. After
closing, you can begin to have the measures
installed. Take up to 90 days after loan closing
to complete the installation.

Verification . . .
5. Get a post-installation inspection from the
rater. Then use the savings on your utility bill
to help repay the loan—and rest easy with the
increased comfort that the energy improvements
provide.

Appendix F. California Home Energy Efficiency Rating System
Brochure Excerpts

3 CHEERS for . . .C.H.E.E.R.S.
California’s New Program for Rating Your Home’s Energy Efficiency
1. Lower Your Energy Bills!

CHEERS makes sense and saves dollars.

Energy costs are the second-largest homeowner expense right after your monthly mortgage payment. The
CHEERS Rating gives you the information you need to lower your energy bills. It evaluates such details as
the level of insulation and the types of lighting and windows in your house. Recommendations for
improvements are accompanied with cost estimates as well as projections for annual energy savings.

2. Increase the Value of Your Home! With a CHEERS rating, the value of
your home goes up, while your energy bills go down
Energy efficient homes are better homes. They’re more comfortable. And, they’re cleaner and quieter.
Homes with a high CHEERS Rating also have a competitive advantage when being sold. A high CHEERS
Rating tells the buyer that the home is energy efficient. It also tells the buyer that they will be spending less
on utility bills so they can spend more on their home. And, it tells buyers that there are no hidden surprises in
the form of high utility costs.
Buyers of a home rated by CHEERS may also qualify for an Energy Efficient Mortgage. These mortgages
allow buyers to buy larger homes than they would normally qualify for. Homeowners can also finance
CHEERS recommended improvements through these special mortgages. Be sure to ask your realtor and lender
for additional information.

3. Help Preserve Our Environment!
something to cheer about!

Helping our environment: that’s really

Saving energy is also good for our environment. An energy efficient home causes less pollution. Saving
energy also improves air quality and conserves natural resources.
Using energy wisely means slower depletion of our natural resources. By conserving energy, the need for
new power plants which add to our air polllution problems can be eliminated.
The State of California predicts that home energy requirements will continue to increase annually. To meet
this growing demand, California is relying on more efficient use of energy in the home.
