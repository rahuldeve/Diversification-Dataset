A.  Introduction 

1.  Title: Operating Personnel Communications Protocols 

 

 

2.  Number: 

COM-002-4 

3.  Purpose: 

To improve communications for the issuance of Operating Instructions 

with predefined communications protocols to reduce the possibility of 
miscommunication that could lead to action or inaction harmful to the reliability of the 
Bulk Electric System (BES).  

4.  Applicability: 

4.1.  Functional Entities 

4.1.1  Balancing Authority 

4.1.2  Distribution Provider  

4.1.3  Reliability Coordinator 

4.1.4  Transmission Operator 

4.1.5  Generator Operator 

5.   Effective Date:  The standard shall become effective on the first day of the first calendar 

quarter that is twelve (12) months after the date that the standard is approved by an 
applicable governmental authority or as otherwise provided for in a jurisdiction where 
approval by an applicable governmental authority is required for a standard to go into 
effect. Where approval by an applicable governmental authority is not required, the 
standard shall become effective on the first day of the first calendar quarter that is 
twelve (12)  months after the date the standard is adopted by the NERC Board of 
Trustees or as otherwise provided for in that jurisdiction.   

 

 

B.  Requirements

D.  Compliance 

1.  Compliance Monitoring Process 

1.1.  Compliance Enforcement Authority 

As defined in the NERC Rules of Procedure, Compliance Enforcement 
Authority means NERC or the Regional Entity in their respective roles of 
monitoring and enforcing compliance with the NERC Reliability Standards.  

1.2.  Data Retention 

The following evidence retention periods identify the period of time an entity is 
required to retain specific evidence to demonstrate compliance.  For instances 
where the evidence retention period specified below is shorter than the time since 
the last audit, the Compliance Enforcement Authority may ask an entity to 

 

 

 

Page 4 of 12 

 

COM-002-4  Operating Personnel Communications Protocols  

provide other evidence to show that it was compliant for the full time period since 
the last audit.  

Each Balancing Authority, Distribution Provider, Generator Operator, Reliability 
Coordinator, and Transmission Operator shall each keep data or evidence for each 
applicable Requirement for the current calendar year and one previous calendar 
year, with the exception of voice recordings which shall be retained for a 
minimum of 90 calendar days, unless directed by its Compliance Enforcement 
Authority to retain specific evidence for a longer period of time as part of an 
investigation.  

If a Balancing Authority, Distribution Provider, Generator Operator, Reliability 
Coordinator, or Transmission Operator is found non-compliant, it shall keep 
information related to the non-compliance until mitigation is complete and 
approved or for the time period specified above, whichever is longer. 

 
The Compliance Enforcement Authority shall keep the last audit records and all 
requested and submitted subsequent audit records.
