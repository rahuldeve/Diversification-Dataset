Bring Your Own Bag San Diego

San Diego residents use an 
average of 500 single-use 
plastic bags every year and 
most bags are used for an 
average of only 12 minutes. 
These bags can become 
litter; get buried in the landfi ll; 
or eaten by wildlife.  To help 
reduce single-use plastic bag waste, the State of California 
passed a new law (Senate Bill 270) that will require all 
large grocery stores and pharmacies to discontinue the 
distribution of single-use plastic bags starting July 1, 2015. 
Get ahead of the new law and start bringing your own 
reusable bag today. ESD is also giving away reusable bags 
at community events and on its social media pages. Check 
out: www.byobsd.com for more info.

New Addition to Curbside Recycling
Starting  December  26,  2014  the  City  will  be  accepting

StyrofoamTM blocks and forms are commonly used to protect 
electronics,  appliances  and  furniture  during  shipping.  Please 
note, no packing peanuts, plates, cups or containers.

Check  out  the  What  Goes  Where  section  on  where  to  put

Do Your Part to Reduce Fruit, Vegetable 
and Yard Waste! 
Backyard composting can help prevent these resources from 
taking up valuable landfi ll space and at the same time create a 
benefi cial soil amendment for plants and gardens.  The City 
has partnered with Dixieline ProBuild to offer residents a 
discount on one of three styles of compost bins.

Want to Do More? Help Us Get to Zero Waste!
Zero Waste is reducing, reusing and recycling the resources

a Zero Waste Plan. The goals are 75% waste diversion by 
2020 and Zero Waste by 2040. You can provide input by

Replacing Trash and Recycling Containers
Automated trash and recycling containers are made of a 
strong polyethylene plastic.  They are anticipated to last for 
10 years.  Your containers may be at the end of their useful 
lives and may begin developing cracks or holes.  Black trash 
containers may be replaced through the Environmental 
Services Department for a fee of $70 or you may purchase a 
similar container at a home improvement store.  
Blue recycling bins are currently replaced at no charge. 
Delivery is available for an additional $25 fee per container.  

Call (858) 694-7000 for more information.
