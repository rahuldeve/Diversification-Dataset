2015 Bucks County 

Household Hazardous Waste Collection Events 

Why bring your household hazardous wastes to a scheduled event? 
Household products containing toxic chemicals, like pesticides, oil-based paints, solvents, cleaning products, weed killers and 
automotive batteries  can  be a threat to people  and the environment if improperly discarded. Never throw  these materials into 
the trash, as the toxic chemicals may harm sanitation workers, or result in fires in collection vehicles. It is also not safe to pour 
them into a sink or storm drain as they can end up in the environment polluting the air, water, or soil.
