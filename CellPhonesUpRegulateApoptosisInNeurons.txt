Abstract

The health effects of cell phone radiation exposure are a growing public concern. This study investigated whether expression of genes related to cell
death pathways are dysregulated in primary cultured neurons and astrocytes by exposure to a working Global System for Mobile Communication
(GSM) cell phone rated at a frequency of 1900 MHz. Primary cultures were exposed to cell phone emissions for 2 h. We used array analysis
and real-time RT-PCR to show up-regulation of caspase-2, caspase-6 and Asc (apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a card) gene
expression in neurons and astrocytes. Up-regulation occurred in both on and stand-by modes in neurons, but only in on mode in astrocytes.
Additionally, astrocytes showed up-regulation of the Bax gene. The effects are specific since up-regulation was not seen for other genes associated
with apoptosis, such as caspase-9 in either neurons or astrocytes, or Bax in neurons. The results show that even relatively short-term exposure to
cell phone radiofrequency emissions can up-regulate elements of apoptotic pathways in cells derived from the brain, and that neurons appear to be
more sensitive to this effect than astrocytes.

Cell phones transmit and receive electromagnetic waves, mainly
at frequencies of 8001900 MHz. Cell phone usage is a public
health concern because of the potential risk of chronic exposure
to the low levels of radiofrequency and microwave (RF/MW)
radiation that pulse off the phone antenna, in close proximity
to the users head. Cell phones transmit electromagnetic waves
in all directions, increasing the region of cells within the brain
that are at risk for damage by RF/MW radiation penetrating the
skull. Although RF/MW radiation can result in thermal damage
if energy absorption rates are high, it is more likely that dele-
terious effects of RF/MW radiation on cells of the brain would
be due to non-thermal effects induced by lower intensities of
exposure [5].

Effects of RF/MW radiation on human health have been
widely investigated using an epidemiological approach. Sev-
eral reports showed no association between cell phone use and
brain tumors [4,8,25] while others came to the opposite con-
clusion [17,20]. Headache has been reported among cell phone
users compared to non-users [7]. When rats were exposed to
RF/MW radiation to reproduce normal human exposure, the life
span and tumorigenicity of rats were unchanged [1,21] but evi-
dence of oxidative damage was found in brain tissues [19,29].
RF/MW radiation induced damage can lead to death in single
cell organisms [3], inhibit cell proliferation [9], cause DNA dam-
age [11,32], and alter gene expression in different cell types
including brain cells as measured by gene microarrays [6,14,15].
Although the methods and target cells differ among the report
cited above, the existing literature taken as a whole suggests
that the expression of specific genes and proteins in cultured
cells and intact animals can be affected by RF/MW radiation
exposure [10].

In spite of previous studies, knowledge about the adverse
effects of RF/MW radiation on human health, or the biological
responses to RF/MW radiation exposure is still limited. There
is a paucity of investigation into the cells that are most at risk,

central nervous system (CNS) neurons and glia. The present
experiments have used both gene array and real time RT-PCR to
determine whether exposure to emissions from an operational
cell phone might regulate expression of genes associated with
apoptosis in cells derived from murine brains.

Primary neuron cultures were prepared using E15, timed-
pregnant female ICR mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor,
ME) following a published protocol [30]. All procedures
involving animals were approved by the University of Ken-
tucky IACUC Committee. The neurons were counted and
re-suspended in 2.0 ml neurobasal medium with 25 M glu-
tamate, B27 additive, and antibiotics, then plated at 4.5 105
cells per 35 mm petri-dish and cultured for 3 days (37
C, 5%
CO2). The depth of the medium at the center of the meniscus
was approximately 4 mm. Viability was routinely assessed after
attachment in sister culture dishes using a fluorescent live-dead
assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cultures with viability
less than 95% were not used.



Primary astrocytes were prepared as previously published
[12]. Astrocytes were plated in 2.0 ml Dulbeccos modified
Eagles medium with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan,
UT) and antibiotics at a density of 1 105 cells per 35 mm petri-
dish and cultured for 3 days (37
C, 5% CO2). At this time, the
cultures were 95% viable, approximately 60% confluent, and
consisted of about (58) 105 astrocytes attached to the culture
surface. Purity as assessed by immunostaining for glial fibrillary
acidic protein was 95%. The depth of the medium at the center
of the meniscus was approximately 4 mm.



For RF/MW radiation exposure, the cover was removed from
a petri-dish containing neurons or astrocytes, and a cell phone
either in the on mode (exposed) or in the stand-by mode
(sham) was placed on top of the petri-dish with its antenna over
the center of the dish (Fig. 1). The cell phone was manufactured
by Samsung (model SGH-E105; Ridgefield Park, NJ) (GSM
signal; 1900 MHz). The signal provider was T-Mobile. After
2 h, the cells were harvested for RNA isolation.

Array analysis (GEArray Q series Mouse Apoptosis Arrays,
SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD) was used to
profile the expression of genes related to apoptosis in neuron
cultures. Total RNA was isolated from control and cell phone-
exposed cells using the GenEluteTM Mammalian Total RNA
kit (Sigma). cDNA probes were synthesized with Biotin-16
dUTP [13] and using an AmpoLabeling-LPR kit (SuperAr-

ray Bioscience). Hybridization, washing and chemiluminescent
detection of signals were performed following the manufac-
turers recommendations. Images were scanned using a Kodak
440CF Image Station with 1D software and automatic back-
ground correction. The signal intensity of each spot on the array
is indicative of gene expression level. Arrays were analyzed
using SuperArray on line software (GEArray Expression Anal-
ysis Suite; http://geasuite.superarray.com). The fold-change of
gene expression level was calculated as the ratio of expression
in exposed cells to expression in control cells. Because of their
known variability, arrays were used only as screening tools to
indicate genes of potential interest. Genes showing an increase
or decrease of 35% in two arrays were further examined and
changes were validated by a more quantitative method, real time
RT-PCR.

Real time RT-PCR was performed on control, sham, and
exposed cells using the ABI Prism 7500 system. SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix kit was purchased from Applied Biosystems
(Warrington, UK). cDNA was synthesized from 2 g of total
RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied
Biosystems). cDNAs from all samples were mixed and then
diluted 2, 4, 8, and 16-fold to generate a standard curve for
each gene. The mRNA level of all genes tested by real time
RT-PCR was normalized against 18S mRNA. The RT2 primer
sets for all genes except 18S used in real time RT-PCR were
purchased from SuperArray Bioscience. The primers for 18S
used in real time RT-PCR were designed based on its cDNA
sequence (forward primer: CCCCCCGTGGCGGCGACGAC;
reverse primer: TTGCCCTCCAATGGATCCTC). Real time
RT-PCR data was analyzed by ANOVA with post hoc Scheffes
test (StatView 5.0, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA).

Results of array analyses on neurons are presented in Table 1.
The GEArray Q series mouse apoptosis array contains 96 genes
involved in regulating apoptosis. When primary cultures of neu-
rons were exposed to RF/MW radiation from a cell phone in the
on mode for 2 h, the expression of eight genes was potentially
up-regulated and one gene was potentially down-regulated com-
pared to unexposed, control cells (Table 1). The expression of
the majority of genes on the array was unchanged. Among those
that were changed, caspase-2 and Asc are known to be involved
in the early stages of apoptosis, and caspase-6 is known to be
an apoptosis executor. These initial array data were further val-
idated by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and, in most cases, gene
array and real time RT-PCR results were similar. As observed
in the arrays, mRNAs for Asc, caspase-2 and caspase-6 were
significantly increased in neurons exposed to the cell phone in
the on mode over values in control, non-exposed, neurons. In
addition, we found that exposure to the cell phone in the stand-
by mode also significantly increased expression of these same
genes. Results in the stand-by and on modes were indis-
tinguishable. To validate the specific regulation of caspase-2,
caspase-6 and Asc genes, the expression of other genes within
the apoptotic pathway was also examined. Real time RT-PCR
analysis confirmed gene array results showing that expression
of caspase-9 and Bax genes was not up-regulated by cell phone
exposure (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these results suggest that a
2 h exposure to the cell phone used in these experiments, either

Neurons grown in culture were exposed to a working cell phone. Gene array analysis was used to examine changes in expression of genes related to apoptosis. Data
presented are the means of two separate experiments. The fold change values represent gene expression levels detected in cells exposed to a cell phone in the on

icant changes in expression of specific pro-apoptotic genes in
cultured mouse neurons.

To determine whether the responses described above were
specific to neurons, the expression of the same genes was
also examined by real time RT-PCR in control, sham-exposed

(stand-by mode), and exposed (on mode) primary astro-
cytes. Similar to the case in neurons, the caspase-2, caspase-6,
and Asc genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in
astrocytes exposed to the cell phone in the on position, while
the caspase-9 gene was unchanged. However, unlike the situa-
tion in neurons, the Bax gene was also up-regulated in astrocytes
(Fig. 2B). Exposure to the cell phone in stand-by mode did
not increase expression of any gene above control levels.

Apoptosis is a cellular suicide mechanism that occurs in
mammalian cells during normal development and also as a
response to situations of injury or disease. Caspases, a fam-
ily of cysteine proteases, have been identified as important
effectors of the intrinsic cell death machinery. Both caspase-
2 and caspase-6 were significantly up-regulated in primary
mouse neurons and astrocytes after RF/MW radiation expo-
sure. Caspase-2 was recently shown to be an initiator caspase
when DNA damage occurs [28]. Agents causing DNA damage
were shown to first activate caspase-2, which in turn initiated
both mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial events. Caspase-2
promotes Bax translocation to the mitochondria, increases mito-
chondrial permeability, releases cytochrome-c into the cytosol,
and finally activates caspase-9 [18,26]. For this reason, we
also analyzed Bax and caspase-9 mRNA levels in experimen-
tal neurons and astrocytes by real time RT-PCR. Exposure
to cell phone RF/MW radiation did not alter the transcrip-
tion of caspase-9 in either cell type (Fig. 2). This suggests
that in the timeframe of these experiments, any activation of
caspase-9 which occurs does not involve new gene transcription.
Bax transcription was increased in astrocytes but unchanged
in neurons, suggesting that the responses of neurons and glia
to cell phone exposure differs. RF/MW radiation is capable
of inducing DNA damage in human cells [2,11,32]. The acti-
vation of caspase-2 in our experiments may reflect cellular
DNA damage caused by cell phone exposure. Unlike other
caspases, caspase-2 also has a non-enzymatic function. Acti-
vation of caspase-2 can induce NF-B and p38 MAPK in a
TRAF2-mediated manner [22], and could result in activation
of apoptotic effectors through these downstream elements. Our
gene arrays indicated a 60% up-regulation in TRAF2 mRNA
in mouse neurons after exposure to cell phone RF/MW radi-
ation compared to control cells (Table 1). We also found that

other TRAF family members (TRAF3, 5, 6) were up-regulated
(Table 1). p38 MAPK was also activated by cell phone RF/MW
radiation in the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 [24],
suggesting this is a potential common response to cell phone
exposure.

Cell phone exposure also significantly up-regulated expres-
sion of the caspase-6 gene in both mouse neurons and astrocytes.
Caspase-6 can play a critical role in human neuronal degenera-
tion through induction of Bid dependent cytochrome-c release
and activation of caspase-8 [16,23]. Even though we did not
analyze the levels of caspase-6 protein or activity, the increase
in mRNA indicates that cell phone use may adversely affect
CNS function through this pathway. Although caspase-3 is
the responsible effector for apoptosis in many situations, array
data showed that caspase-3 transcription was not significantly
increased in neurons exposed to cell phone RF/MW radiation
(data not shown). Thus, in terms of caspases and immediate
upstream members of caspase signaling pathways, the increases
seen in activity of the caspase-2 and caspase-6 genes appear to
be relatively specific.

Asc, a member of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-
containing adaptor protein family [27] involved in caspase-1
activation [31], was also significantly up-regulated in mouse pri-
mary neurons and astrocytes after cell phone exposure (Table 1
and Fig. 2). The caspase-1 gene was not activated in exposed
neurons (data not shown), suggesting that procaspase-1 might
be cleaved by Asc independent of any additional transcription.
Our results suggest that specific CNS cells may activate dif-
ferent genes in response to cell phone emissions, and that there is
a variable threshold sensitivity depending on cell type. The vari-
ations in culture conditions that could contribute to the observed
differences were minimized since both cells were grown in an
attached manner, in the same size culture dish, and in the same
volume of medium. Still, some technical differences are impos-
sible to avoid and might create disparities in the amount of
total radiation received by the two cell types. For example, the
culture media for astrocytes and neurons is slightly different.
Astrocytes, which are highly proliferative, were also plated at a
lower density compared to neurons to allow for expansion of the
cell population between plating and RF/MW radiation exposure.
Inherent differences in cell size and shape, composition of cell
membranes, organelle distribution, junctional coupling between
adjacent cells, stage of the cell cycle, and other parameters that
cannot be controlled will also contribute to different amounts of
energy absorption by the cells.

Our experiments were designed to test whether exposure to
a cell phone under ambient conditions altered the expression
of apoptotic genes, regardless of the frequencies within the
electromagnetic field that caused the effects. For this reason,
we did not measure or attempt to control the electromagnetic
field components. Much of the radiation emitted by GSM cell
phones is in the frequency range of radiofrequency (3 kHz to
300 MHz) and microwave (300 mHz to 300 Ghz) radiation. The
biological consequences of RF/MW radiation can include both
thermal and non-thermal effects, depending on a number of
electromagnetic field parameters, including the power, duration
or intermittency of exposure, pulse shape, and ambient field

strength [5]. The specific absorption rate (SAR) is often used
to describe thermal effects of absorbed RF/MW radiation, and
to provide a basis of comparison between experiments. We
did not measure the SAR, since our studies were designed
to compare effects between two very different types of cells.
The SAR reflects the additive effects of all parameters that
contribute to thermal absorption, including both inherent cell
structure differences as well as differences in culture conditions
and field strength. Since the SAR for neurons and astrocytes is
likely to be different because of their distinct cell structure, it
would not be a practical basis on which to compare exposure.
Some cell phones also emit radiation in the extremely low
frequency (ELF) (5060 Hz) range, which can contribute to
non-thermal biological effects. Although our cell phone was
rated at 1900 MHz, ELF emission was detected and measured
at 50100 nT (equivalent to 0.51 mG) in on mode, and 5 nT
(0.05 mG) in stand-by mode (Multidetector II, Less EMF Inc.,
Germany). Both measurements were higher than the background
environmental level of 2 nT. Since the phone used in these
experiments had emissions over a wide frequency range, it is
not clear which component(s) of the electromagnetic field were
responsible for induction of apoptotic gene activity in neurons
and astrocytes. Similarly, the induction may result from thermal
effects, non-thermal effects, or some combination thereof.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the
effects of RF/MW emissions from a working cell phone on
elements of cell death signaling pathways in primary neurons
and astrocytes. Overall, there have been few published studies
that explore the responses of primary cells to an actual mobile
communication signal, which may be quite different from
those in a standardized and tightly controlled electromagnetic
exposure chamber. Our results indicate that short-term exposure
to cell phone RF/MW radiation emissions can up-regulate
specific intermediaries of apoptotic pathways, with neurons
appearing to have a lower threshold for apoptotic activation
than astrocytes. Cell phone emissions thus have the potential
to cause dysfunction or death through activation of specific
intracellular cell death signaling pathways.
