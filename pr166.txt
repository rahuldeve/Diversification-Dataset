Greenhouse gases (GHGs) warm the surface and the atmosphere with significant implications for rainfall,
retreat of glaciers and sea ice, sea level, among other factors. About 30 years ago, it was recognized that
the increase in tropospheric ozone from air pollution (NOx, CO and others) is an important greenhouse forcing
term. In addition, the recognition of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on stratospheric ozone and its climate effects
linked chemistry and climate strongly. What is less recognized, however, is a comparably major global problem
dealing with air pollution. Until about ten years ago, air pollution was thought to be just an urban or a local
problem. But new data have revealed that air pollution is transported across continents and ocean basins
due to fast long-range transport, resulting in trans-oceanic and trans-continental plumes of atmospheric
brown clouds (ABCs) containing sub micron size particles, i.e., aerosols. ABCs intercept sunlight by absorbing
as well as reflecting it, both of which lead to a large surface dimming. The dimming effect is enhanced further
because aerosols may nucleate more cloud droplets, which makes the clouds reflect more solar radiation.
The dimming has a surface cooling effect and decreases evaporation of moisture from the surface, thus
slows down the hydrological cycle. On the other hand, absorption of solar radiation by black carbon and
some organics increase atmospheric heating and tend to amplify greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.
ABCs are concentrated in regional and mega-city hot spots. Long-range transport from these hot spots
causes widespread plumes over the adjacent oceans. Such a pattern of regionally concentrated surface
dimming and atmospheric solar heating, accompanied by widespread dimming over the oceans, gives
rise to large regional effects. Only during the last decade, we have begun to comprehend the surprisingly
large regional impacts. In S. Asia and N. Africa, the large north-south gradient in the ABC dimming has
altered both the north-south gradients in sea surface temperatures and landocean contrast in surface
temperatures, which in turn slow down the monsoon circulation and decrease rainfall over the conti-
nents. On the other hand, heating by black carbon warms the atmosphere at elevated levels from 2 to
6 km, where most tropical glaciers are located, thus strengthening the effect of GHGs on retreat of snow
packs and glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan glaciers.
Globally, the surface cooling effect of ABCs may have masked as much 47% of the global warming by
greenhouse gases, with an uncertainty range of 2080%. This presents a dilemma since efforts to curb air
pollution may unmask the ABC cooling effect and enhance the surface warming. Thus efforts to reduce
GHGs and air pollution should be done under one common framework. The uncertainties in our
understanding of the ABC effects are large, but we are discovering new ways in which human activities
are changing the climate and the environment.

1. Introduction

This article is largely a perspective on the role of air pollution in
climate change. It summarizes the developments since the mid
1970s. Before that time, the climate change problem was largely
perceived as a CO2-restricted global warming issue. Furthermore,
this paper also provides new insights into emerging issues such as
global dimming, the role of air pollution in masking global warming,

and its potentially major role in regional climate changes, such as the
slowing down of the S. Asian monsoon system, and the retreat of
arctic sea ice and the tropical glaciers. It concludes with a discussion
on how air pollution mitigation laws will likely be a major factor
determining the climate warming trends of the coming decades.

Svante Arrhenius, the Swedish Nobel chemist. Arrhenius (1896)
developed a simple mathematical model for the transfer of radiant
energy through the atmospheresurface system, and solved it
analytically to show that a doubling of the atmospheric CO2
concentration would lead to a warming of the surface by as much as
45 K. Since then, there has been a tremendous amount of work on
the science of global warming, culminating in the now famous
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. In this
paper, we would like to focus on the scientific underpinnings of the
link between greenhouse gases and global warming, and then place
the role of air pollution in that context.

2.1.

Inadvertent modification of the atmosphere

The atmosphere is a thin shell of gases, particles and clouds
surrounding the planet. It is in this thin shell that we are dumping
several billion tons of pollutants each year. The major sources of
this pollution include fossil fuel combustion for power generation
and transportation; cooking with solid fuels; and burning of forests
and savannah. The ultimate by-product of all forms of burning is
the emission of the colorless gas, carbon dioxide (CO2). But there
are also products of incomplete combustion, such as CO and NOx,
which can react with other gaseous species in the atmosphere. The
net effect of these reactions is to produce ozone, another green-
house gas. Energy consumption also leads to aerosol precursor
gases (e.g., SO2) and primary aerosols in the atmosphere, which
have direct negative impacts on human health and ecosystems.

2.2. From local to regional and global pollution

Every part of the world is connected with every other part
through fast atmospheric transport. For example, Fig. 1 shows
a snap shot of how air can travel from one region to another in
about a week. The trajectories clearly show that air parcels can
travel thousands of kilometers across from East Asia into N Amer-
ica; from N America across the Atlantic into Europe; from S Asia into
E Asia; from Australia into the Antarctic, and so on. Aircraft and
satellite data clearly reveal that within a week, emissions can be
transported half way around the world into trans-oceanic and
trans-continental plumes, no matter whether they are from Asia, or
N America, or Africa.

The lifetime of a CO2 molecule in the atmosphere is of the order
of a century or more. This is more than sufficient time for the
billions of tons of man-made CO2 to uniformly cover the planet like
a blanket. The steady increase of atmospheric CO2 has been docu-
mented extensively. The question is, why should we worry about
this colorless gaseous blanket?

2.3. The climate system: basic drivers

The incident solar radiation drives the climate system, atmo-
spheric chemistry as well as life on the Earth. About 30% of the
incoming solar energy is reflected back to space. The balance of 70%
is absorbed by the surfaceatmosphere system. This energy heats
the planet and the atmosphere. As the surface and the atmosphere
become warm, they give off the energy as infrared radiation, also
referred to as long wave radiation. So the process of the net
incoming (downward solar energy minus the reflected) solar
energy warming the system and the outgoing heat radiation from
the warmer planet escaping to space goes on, until the two
components of the energy are in balance. On an average sense, it is
this radiation energy balance that provides a powerful constraint
for the global average temperature of the planet. Greenhouse gases
(GHGs) absorb and emit long wave radiation, while aerosols absorb
and scatter solar radiation. Aerosols also absorb and emit long wave
radiation (particularly large size aerosols such as dust), but this
process is not significant for the smaller anthropogenic aerosols.

2.4. The greenhouse effect: the CO2 blanket

On a cold winter night, a blanket keeps the body warm not
because the blanket gives off any energy. Rather, the blanket traps
the body heat, preventing it
from escaping to the colder
surroundings. Similarly, the CO2 blanket, traps the long wave
radiation given off by the planet. The trapping of the long wave
radiation is dictated by quantum mechanics. The two oxygen atoms
in CO2 vibrate with the carbon atom in the center and the frequency
of this vibration coincides with some of the infrared wavelengths of
the long wave radiation. When the frequency of the radiation from
the Earths surface and the atmosphere coincides with the
frequency of CO2 vibration, the radiation is absorbed by CO2, and
converted to heat by collision with other air molecules, and then

given back to the surface. As a result of this trapping, the outgoing
long wave radiation is reduced by increasing CO2. Not as much heat
is escaping to balance the net incoming solar radiation. There is
excess heat energy in the planet, i.e., the system is out of energy
balance. As CO2 is increasing with time, the infrared blanket is
becoming thicker, and the planet is accumulating this excess
energy.

2.5. Global warming: getting rid of the excess energy

How does the planet get rid of the excess energy? We know
from basic infrared laws of physics, the so-called Plancks black
body radiation law, that warmer bodies emit more radiation. So the
planetary system will get rid of this excess energy by warming and
thus emitting more infrared radiation, until the excess energy
trapped is given off to space and the surfaceatmosphere system is
in balance. That, in a nutshell, is the theory of the greenhouse effect
and global warming. A rigorous mathematical modeling of this
energy balance paradigm was originated by Arrhenius (1896), but
the proper accounting of the energy balance of the coupled
surfaceatmosphere system had to await the work of Manabe and
Wetherald in 1967 (Manabe and Wetherald, 1967).

2.6. CFCs: the super greenhouse gas

For nearly eighty years since the Arrhenius paper, climate
scientists assumed that CO2 was the main anthropogenic or man-
made greenhouse gas (e.g., SMIC Report, 1971). Since CO2 does not
react with other gases in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect
was largely a problem of solving the physics, thermodynamics and
dynamics of climate. This picture changed drastically when it was
discovered that there are other man-made gases, which on a per
molecule basis could be up to ten thousand times stronger than the
CO2 greenhouse effect (Ramanathan, 1975). Chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, used as refrigerants and propellants in deodorizers, drug
delivery pumps, etc are some of the strongest of such super
greenhouse gases. These are purely synthetic gases. In 1974, Molina
and Rowland published a famous paper in Nature (Molina and
Rowland, 1974). They proposed that CFC11 and CFC12 (known then
as Freon 11 and Freon 12) will build up in the atmosphere including
the stratosphere, because of their century or longer life time.
According to their theory, UV radiation from the sun will photo-
dissociate the CFCs, and the released chlorine atoms will catalyti-
cally destroy ozone in the stratosphere.

Why do CFCs have such a disproportionately large greenhouse
effect? There are three important reasons (Ramanathan, 1975): (1)
CFCs absorb and emit radiation in the 812 mm region. The back-
ground atmosphere is quite transparent in this region; i.e., the
natural greenhouse blanket is thinnest in the 812 mm region, and
for this reason this region is called as the atmospheric window. The
background water vapour has very little absorption. (2) Next, the
quantum mechanical efficiency (also knows as transition proba-
bility) of CFCs is about 36 times stronger than that due to CO2. In
addition, CFCs have many absorption bands in this region. (3) Lastly,
the CFC concentrations are so low (part per billion or less) that their
effect increases linearly with their concentration, where as the CO2
absorption is close to saturation since their concentration is about
300,000 times larger. So its a lot harder for a CO2 molecule to
enhance the greenhouse effect than CFCs. These three factors
combine to make CFCs a super greenhouse gas. Within a period of
10 years after the CFC paper by Ramanathan in 1975, several tens of
anthropogenic greenhouse gases were added to the list (e.g., Wang
et al., 1976; Ramanathan et al., 1985a). They have similar strong
absorption features in the window region, making the window
a dirty window (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Spectral absorption of trace gases in the atmospheric window (Ramanathan,
1988).

2.7. Climatechemistry interactions

The independent discoveries of the CFC effect on stratospheric
ozone chemistry and on the greenhouse effect, coupled atmo-
spheric chemistry strongly with climate. Another major develop-
ment that contributed to the chemistryclimate interactions is
(Crutzen, 1972) Crutzens paper on the effect of nitrogen oxides
(another pollutant) on the stratospheric ozone layer. Stratospheric
ozone regulates the UV and visible solar radiation reaching the
surfacetroposphere system (the first 1016 km from the surface
where the weather is generated); in addition, ozone is a strong
greenhouse gas, absorbing and emitting radiation in the 9.6 mm
region. It was shown that reducing ozone in the stratosphere would
cool not only the stratosphere (anticipated earlier) but will also cool
the surface (Ramanathan et al., 1976). This was surprising, because
the additional solar radiation to the surface (from ozone reduction
aloft) was expected to warm the surface. While this indeed
happened as shown by Ramanathan et al. (1976), the reduced long
wave radiation from the cooler stratosphere and the reduction on
ozone greenhouse effect dominated the solar effect. Thus climate
and air chemistry became strongly linked (Fig. 3). There was
another important development in 1976, when Wang et al. (1976)
showed methane and nitrous oxide to be strong greenhouse gases
as well. Both of these gases have natural sources, as well as,
anthropogenic ones (agriculture; natural gas; increase in cattle

population, etc.). These two gases also interfered with the ozone
chemistry, and contributed to the increase in lower atmosphere
ozone along with carbon monoxide and NOx (major air pollutants).
It was shown by Fishman et al. (1980) that increase in tropospheric
ozone from air pollution (CO and NOx) is an important contributor
to global warming. Until the Fishman et al. (1980) study, lower
atmosphere ozone was recognized only as a pollutant. Thus in
a matter of five years after the discovery of the CFC greenhouse
effect, chemistry emerged as a major climate forcing process
(Fig. 3).

Thus through tropospheric ozone, air pollution became an
important source for global warming. The global warming problem
was not just a CO2 problem, but became recognized as a trace gas 
climate change problem.

2.8. WMOs recognition and lead into IPCC

But it took five more years for the climate community to accept
this view, when WMO commissioned a committee to look into the
greenhouse effect issue of trace gases. The committee published as
a WMO report in 1985, and concluded that trace gases other than
CO2 contributed as much as CO2 to the anthropogenic climate
forcing from pre-industrial times (Ramanathan et al., 1985b). This
report also gave a definition for the now widely used term: Radi-
ative Forcing, which is still used by the community. Shortly there-
after, WMO and UNEP formed the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. The IPCC (2001) report confirmed
that the CO2 contributed about half of the total forcing and the
balance is due to the increases in methane, nitrous oxide, halo-
carbons and ozone. The anthropogenic radiative forcing from pre-
industrial to now (year 2005) is about 3 Wm2, out of which about
1.6 Wm2 is due to the CO2 increase and the rest is due to CFCs and
other halocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and others. The
unit Wm2 represents the number of watts added energy per
square meter of the Earths surface.

3. Prediction and detection: the missing warming

3.1. When will the warming be detected?

As the importance of the greenhouse effect of trace gases began
to emerge, it became clear that the climate problem was more
imminent than assumed earlier. In fact, it was predicted by Madden
and Ramanathan in 1980 that we should see the warming by 2000
(Madden and Ramanathan, 1980). The IPCC report published in
2001 confirmed this prediction, but the observed warming trend of
about 0.8 C from 1900 to 2005, was a factor of two to three smaller
than the magnitude predicted by most models, as shown below.

3.2. Magnitude of the predicted warming

IPCC (2007) concludes that the climate system will warm by 3 C
(2 C4.5 C) for a doubling of CO2. The radiative forcing for
a doubling of CO2 is 3.8 Wm2 (15%) (Ramanathan et al., 1979;
IPCC, 2001). Thus, we infer that the climate sensitivity term (also
referred to as climate feedback) is 1.25 Wm2 C1 (14 3.8 Wm2/
3 C), i.e., it takes 1.25 Wm2 to warm the surface and the atmo-
sphere by 1 C. If the planet, including the atmosphere, were to
warm uniformly with no change in its composition including
clouds, water vapour and snow/ice cover, it will take 3.3 Wm2 to
warm the planet by 1 C. The reduction in the feedback term from
3.3 Wm2 C1 to 1.25 Wm2 C1 is due to positive climate feed-
back between atmospheric temperature (T) and water vapour,
snow and sea ice. Basically as the atmosphere warms, the satura-
tion vapour pressure increases exponentially (by about 7% per C
increase in T); and as a result, humidity increases proportionately.

Since water vapour is the strongest greenhouse gas in the atmo-
sphere, the increase in water vapour greenhouse effect amplifies
the initial warming. Similarly, snow cover and sea ice shrinks with
warming, which enhances solar absorption by the underlying
darker surface, thus amplifying the warming (IPCC, 2007).
Using the IPCC (2007) estimated radiative forcing of 3 Wm2
due to anthropogenic GHGs and the climate feedback term of
1.25 Wm2 C1, we obtain the expected warming due to the pre-
industrial build up of GHGs as 2.4 C (1.6 C to 3.6 C). This should
be compared with the observed warming of 0.8 C from 1850 to
now. IPCC (2007) infers that about 30% (about 0.2 C) of the
observed warming is due to natural factors, such as trends in
forcing due to volcanic activity and solar insolation. While the
observed warming is consistent with the GHGs forcing, its magni-
tude is smaller by a factor of about 3w4. One point to note is that
the predicted warming of 2.4 C is the equilibrium warming, which
is basically the warming we will observe decades to century from
now, if we held the GHG levels constant at todays levels. Some of
the heat is stored in the ocean because of its huge thermal inertia. It
mixes the heat by turbulence quickly (within weeks to months) to
the first 50100 m depth. From there in about a few years to
decades, the large-scale ocean circulation mixes the heat to about
5001000 m depth. Some of the excess energy trapped is still
circulating in the ocean. Oceanographers have estimated that about
0.6 (0.2) Wm2 of the 3 Wm2 is still stored in the ocean (Barnett
et al., 2001). So about 0.5 C (14 0.6 Wm2/1.25 Wm2 C1) of the
warming will show up in the next few decades to a century. We still
have to account for the missing warming of about 1.3 C {14 2.4 C
(0.8 C  0.2 C  0.5 C)}.

Let us summarize our deductions thus far. Based on the build up
of greenhouse gases since the dawn of the industrial era, we have
committed (using the terminology in Ramanathan, 1988) the planet
to a warming of 2.4 C (1.63.6 C). About 0.6 C of the observed
warming can be attributed to the GHGs forcing; and about 0.5 C is
stored in the oceans; and the balance of 1.3 C is unaccounted for.
The stage is set now to consider the masking effect of aerosols,
a topic which was pursued actively since the 1970s (e.g., see
Mitchell, 1970, and Rasool and Schneider, 1971).

Aerosols start off as urban haze or rural smoke, and ultimately
become trans-continental and trans-oceanic plumes consisting of
sulfate, nitrate, hundreds of organics, black carbon and other
aerosols. To underline their air pollution origin, we refer to the
aerosols as atmospheric brown clouds (ABCs) (Ramanathan and
Crutzen, 2003).

4. Atmospheric brown clouds: global and regional radiative
forcing

In addition to adding greenhouse gases, human activities also
contributed to the addition of aerosols (condensed particles in sub
micron size) to the atmosphere. Since 1970 (Mitchell, 1970),
scientists have speculated that
these aerosols are reflecting
sunlight back to space before it reaches the surface, and thus
contribute to a cooling of the surface. This was further refined by
Charlson et al. (1990) with a chemical transport model. They made
an estimate of the cooling effect of sulfate aerosols (resulting from
SO2 emission), and concluded that the sulfate cooling may be
substantial. Essentially, aerosol concentrations increased in time
along with greenhouse gases, and the cooling effect of the aerosols
have masked some of the greenhouse warming. We are choosing
the word mask deliberately, for when we get rid of the air
pollution, the masking would disappear and the full extent of the
committed warming of 2.4 C would show up. Several tens of
groups around the world are working on this masking effect using
models and satellite data. Thus, the emergence of ABCs as a major
agent of climate change links all three of the major environmental

problems related to the atmosphere under one common frame-
work (Fig. 4).

Our understanding of the impact of these aerosols has under-
gone a major revision, due to new experimental findings from field
observations, such as the Indian Ocean Experiment (Ramanathan
et al., 2001a) and ACEAsia (Huebert et al., 2003) among others,
and global modeling studies (e.g., Boucher et al., 1998; Penner et al.,
1998; Lohmann and Feichter, 2001; Menon et al., 2002; Penner
et al., 2003; Lohmann et al., 2004; Liao and Seinfeld, 2005; Take-
mura et al., 2005; Penner et al., 2006). Aerosols enhance scattering
and absorption of solar radiation, and also produce brighter clouds
that are less efficient at releasing precipitation. These in turn lead to
large reductions in the amount of solar radiation reaching Earths
surface, a corresponding increase in atmospheric solar heating,
changes
surface cooling,
disruption of regional circulation systems such as the monsoons,
suppression of rainfall, and less efficient removal of pollutants.
Black carbon, sulfate, and organics play a major role in the dimming
of the surface (e.g., IPCC, 2007; Figure. 2.21; Ramanathan and
Carmichael, 2008, Figure 2). Man-made aerosols have dimmed the
surface of the planet, while making it brighter at the top of the
atmosphere.

in atmospheric thermal

structure,

Together the aerosol radiation and microphysical effects can
lead to a weaker hydrological cycle and drying of the planet, which
connects aerosols directly to the availability of fresh water, a major
environmental issue of the 21st century (Ramanathan et al., 2001b).
For example, the Sahelian drought during the last century is
attributed by models to aerosols (Williams et al., 2001; Rotstayn
and Lohmann, 2002). In addition, new-coupled oceanatmosphere
model studies suggest that aerosols may be the major source for
some of the observed drying of the land regions of the planet
during the last 50 years (Ramanathan et al., 2005; Held et al., 2005;
Lambert et al., 2005; Chung and Ramanathan, 2006). On a regional
scale, aerosol induced radiative changes (forcing) are an order of
magnitude larger than that of the greenhouse gases; but the global
climate effects of the greenhouse forcing are still more important
because of its global nature. There is one important distinction to be
made. While the warming due to the greenhouse gases will make
the planet wetter, i.e., more rainfall, the large reduction in surface
solar radiation due to absorbing aerosols will make the planet drier.

4.1. Regional plumes of widespread brown clouds

Brown clouds are usually associated with the brownish urban
haze such seen over the horizon in most urban skies. The brownish
color is due to strong solar absorption by black carbon in the soot
and NO2. Due to fast atmospheric transport, the urban and rural

haze becomes widespread trans-oceanic and trans-continental
plumes of ABCs in a few days to a week. Until 2000 we had to rely
largely on global models to characterize their large-scale structure.
The launch of TERRA satellite with the MODIS instrument provided
a whole new perspective of the ABC issue, because MODIS was able
to retrieve aerosol optical depths (AODs) and effective particle size
over the land as well as the oceans (Kaufman et al., 2002).
Furthermore, NASAs ground based AERONET (Aerosol Robotic
Network)
sites with solar-disc scanning spectroradiometers
provided not only ground truth over 100 locations around the
world but also aerosol absorption optical depth and single scat-
tering albedo (Holben et al., 2001).

Field observations such as the Indian Ocean Experiment (Ram-
anathan et al., 2001a) and ACEAsia (Huebert et al., 2003) provided
in situ data for the chemical composition of ABCs as well as their
vertical distribution. Another important development is the advent
of atmospheric observations with light-weight and autonomous
UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which could be flown in stacked
formation to measure directly solar heating rates due to ABCs
(Ramanathan et al., 2007a; Ramana et al., 2007). By integrating
these data and assimilating them in a global framework, Chung
et al. (2005) and Ramanathan et al. (2007b) were able to provide
a global distribution of aerosol optical properties dimming and
atmospheric solar heating for the 20002003 time period. Using
these integrated data sets, we characterize the various ABC plumes
around the world (Fig. 5). The figure shows anthropogenic AODs for
all four seasons of the year. The following major plumes are iden-
tified in Fig. 5:

1) Dec to March: Indo-Asian-Pacific Plume; N Atlantic-African-S

Indian Ocean Plume;

2) April to June: N Atlantic-African-S Indian Ocean Plume; E

Asian-Pacific-N American Plume; Latin American Plume;

3) July to August: N American Plume; European Plume; SE Asian-
Australian Plume; N Atlantic-African-S Indian Ocean Plume;
Amazonian Plume;

4) September to November: E Asian-Pacific-N American Plume;

Latin American Plume.

It should be noted that ABCs occur through out the year in most
continental and adjacent oceanic regions, but their concentrations
peak in some seasons: dry season in the tropics and summer
seasons in the extra tropics. Simulated AODs for year 2001 using
a chemical transport model (the LLNL/IMPACT model at Univ. of
Michigan) documented elsewhere (Liu and Penner, 2002; Rotman
et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Feng and Penner, 2007) is shown in
Fig. 6 (Feng and Ramanathan, in preparation). There is overall
correspondence between regional plumes derived from observa-
tionally retrieved AODs and simulated AODs. The simulations also
reveal the seasonally dependent plumes identified from the
assimilated values; since the color scales and seasons are identical
in the two figures, it can be seen that the simulate values are also
quantitatively consistent.

4.2. Global distribution of dimming

The major source of dimming is ABC absorption of direct solar
radiation. This is further enhanced by the reflection of solar radi-
ation back to space by ABCs. This should be contrasted with the TOA
forcing that is solely due to the reflection of solar radiation back to
space. This distinction has been ignored frequently; as a result, the
dimming has been mistakenly linked with surface cooling trends
(e.g., Wild et al., 2004; Streets et al., 2006). The problems with this
approach are the following: for black carbon, the dimming at the
surface is accompanied by positive forcing at the top of the atmo-
sphere (Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008), thus it is erroneous to

42

assume dimming will result in cooling. Furthermore, as we will
show later, the surface dimming due to ABCs with absorbing
aerosols is a factor of 25 larger than the aerosol TOA forcing, and
for many regions they can be even of opposite sign. Most of the
solar absorption is due to elemental carbon and some organics, and
these aerosol species are referred to as black carbon. The reflection
of solar radiation is due to sulfate, nitrate, organic matter, fly ash
and dust. Additional dimming is caused by soluble aerosols (e.g.
sulfate) nucleating more cloud droplets, which in turn enhance
reflection of solar radiation back to space. But the major source of
dimming is due to the direct absorption and reflection of solar
radiation by aerosols as shown in Fig. 7, along with emissions of
black carbon and sulfur (gaseous precursor of sulfate). Over most

regions of the ABC plumes, the dimming is large in the range of 6
25 Wm2. In remote oceanic regions, the dimming is much smaller
and is in the range of 13 Wm2. The large dimming values over
oceanic regions downwind of polluted continents are consistent
with the results from the Indian Ocean Experiment (Ramanathan
et al., 2001a).

Global average ABC forcings at the surface, in the atmosphere,
and at the top of the atmosphere are compared with the green-
house forcing in Fig. 8. At the TOA, the ABC (that is, BC  non-BC)
forcing of 1.4 W m2, which includes a 1 W m2 indirect forcing,
may have masked as much as 50% (25%) of the global forcing due
to GHGs. The estimated aerosol forcing of 1.4 W m2 due to ABCs
is within 15% of the aerosol forcing derived in the recent IPCC report

(IPCC, 2007). The main point to note is that, because of the solar
absorption within the atmosphere (3 Wm2), the ABC surface
forcing (4.4 Wm2) is a factor of 3 larger than the TOA forcing
(1.4 Wm2). The dimming at the surface is approximately esti-
mated as surface forcing/(1As), where As
is surface albedo.
Assuming an average As of 0.15, we obtain for the dimming
5.2 Wm2
the dimming that
occurred during 20002002 due to anthropogenic aerosols, or,
ABCs. Since emissions of some aerosol precursors such as SO2
peaked in the 1970s followed by a decline of about 30% from the
1970s to date, the dimming during the 1970s could have been
larger.

(14 4.4 Wm2/0.85). This

is

as the net radiative forcing due to aerosol, since there is no
compensatory heating of atmosphere; therefore, a direct compar-
ison of the surface dimming with GHGs forcing is appropriate. For
soot, however, the dimming at the surface is mostly by the increase
in atmospheric solar absorption, and hence the dimming does not
necessarily reflect a cooling effect. It should also be noted that the
dimming at the surface due to soot solar absorption can be a factor
of 3 larger than the dimming due to reflection of solar (a cooling
effect).

4.3. How long has the dimming been going on?

There is an important distinction between the dimming by
scattering aerosols like sulfate, and that due to absorbing aerosols
like soot. For sulfate, the dimming at the surface is nearly the same

IPCC (2007) estimates that the net global average aerosol forcing
from pre-industrial to year 2005 is negative. This negative forcing is
due to enhanced reflection of solar radiation. The deduction from

greenhouse gases (GHGs). Positive and negative forcings are shown in magenta and blue colors, respectively (Source: Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008.).

this finding is that global scale dimming has been going on since
the pre-industrial to now. The magnitude of the aerosol forcing
from IPCC (2007) is 1.2 Wm2. In terms of trend, assuming that
most of the aerosol forcing is from 1900 onwards, the trend is of the
order of 0.1 (with an uncertainty of factor of 2) Wm2 per decade.
However, the forcing at the surface (4.4 Wm2) is much larger in
magnitude than the TOA forcing as shown in Fig. 8. The global
dimming trend due to ABCs is most likely of the order of
0.5 Wm2 per decade (with an uncertainty of factor of two). It
should also be noted that the dimming would have been larger in
the 1970s when the SO2 emission peaked (Streets et al., 2006).

There have been numerous studies that claimed widespread
reduction of solar radiation at the surface (Gilgen et al., 1998;
Ohmura et al., 1989; Stanhill and Cohen, 2001; Liepert, 2002), using
surface network of radiometers (mainly broad band pyranometers).
We begin with the first study that used the term global dimming
(Stanhill and Cohen, 2001). They reviewed earlier studies and sub-
selected the data to include only thermopile radiometers, and their
data set included more than 150 stations from both the northern
and southern hemisphere. The data covered the period from 1958
to 1992. Based on analysis of this data set, they reported a globally
averaged dimming of 20 Wm2 for a 34-year period from 1958 to
1992. This was followed by Liepert (2002), who conducted a trend
analysis of the so-called GEBA network of pyranometers (over 150
stations) maintained by Ohmura et al. (1989) for the 19611990
period. Liepert differenced the decadal-average surface solar radi-
ation between 19811990 and 19611970 and obtained a globally
averaged dimming of 7 Wm2. Although Liepert refers to the
inferred trend as a thirty year trend form 1961 to 1990, it is really
a twenty year trend since the difference is between two ten year
periods (19611970 and 19811990) separated by 20 years. These
trends are for downward solar radiation whereas we need the trend
in absorbed solar radiation, which is obtained by multiplying the
downward solar radiation trend by 0.85 (following Wild et al.,
2004). Thus the 20-year trend (19651985) in absorbed solar
radiation is 6 Wm2 for Liepert (2002), while the 34-year trend
the surface is
(19581992)
17 Wm2 for Stanhill and Cohen (2001). The underlying message
is that the dimming trend has been going on at least from the 1950s
onwards.

in absorbed solar

radiation at

By analyzing later GEBA data sets, Wild et al. (2005) conclude
that the dimming trend is reversing in most locations of the globe,
except over S Asia. They suggest that this reversal to brightening
commenced around 1990. Most of the GEBA stations analyzed in
their data sets did reveal brightening. However, the length of the
period analyzed in their study is only of 6 years to about 10 years,

thus not of sufficient duration to infer a long term trend. Another
major problem with this study is that, a companion paper that is
published in the same issue of Science by Pinker et al. (2005) seems
to contradict Wild et al. (2005) data. Pinker et al. (2005) analyzed
satellite data from 1983 to 2001 and finds an overall positive trend
of surface solar radiation of about 1.6 Wm2 per decade, with a net
increase of 2.8 Wm2 for the 18-year period. The data also shows
a negative trend from 1983 to 1990, followed by the positive trend
from 1990 to 2001. But when Pinker et al. (2005) separated their
data into oceans and land, the positive trend is observed only for
world ocean averages and the average land values show slight
negative trend, thus contradicting inference of Wild et al. (2005).
In summary, our estimates for the global mean dimming trend
(i.e., trend in absorbed solar radiation at the surface) due to ABCs is
of the order of 0.5 Wm2 per decade (factor of 2), and the trend
in absorbed solar radiation at TOA, i.e., TOA forcing as per IPCC, is
about 0.1 (factor of 2) Wm2 per decade. Dimming trends from
surface radiometers (from 1960 to 1990) range from 3 Wm2 per
decade (Liepert, 2002) to 5 Wm2 per decade (Stanhill and Cohen,
2001). In summary, there is about a factor of 6 to 10 difference in
the global average dimming trend inferred from surface data and
the global analysis of ABCs. Part, if not a major, source of the
difference can be accounted for by the Alpert and Kishcha (2008)
analysis. They show that the magnitude of the dimming is strongly
dependent on the population density and that the dimming trend
(for 19641989) varies from 0.5 Wm2 per decade for sites with
population density of 10 km2 to 3.2 Wm2 per decade for sites
with population density of 200 km2. This result is consistent with
the ABC dimming estimates shown in Fig. 7, which reveals a large
decrease in surface forcing away from the source regions.

This does not mean however there is no dimming outside the
urban regions. As we described earlier, the dimming decreases by
a factor of 510 away from the source regions. For example, the
global mean trend of 0.5 Wm2 per decade we infer from Figs. 7
and 8, varies from 2 Wm2 per decade close to the source regions
to 0.2 Wm2 per decade far away (few thousand kilometers) from
the source region. Trends of the order of 0.2 Wm2 per decade are
below the detectable threshold values in the pyranometers. But
such seemingly low trends are still climatologically significant.
However, Alpert and Kishcha (2008) use their result to deduce that
the dimming is largely an urban phenomenon, which is inconsis-
tent with either IPCCs findings of global negative forcing or the
global ABC dimming values shown in Fig. 8. This is largely
a semantic issue, for the term global dimming has become linked
exclusively with the large dimming trends in the original paper in
Stanhill and Cohen (2001).

In summary, we conclude the following:

1) There is global scale dimming during the last century due to
ABCs (i.e., aerosols) and this deduction is consistent with the
negative aerosol forcing reported by IPCC (2007).

2) Because ABCs absorb solar radiation, the dimming at the
surface is a factor of 3 larger than the negative aerosol forcing at
TOA.
3) A global mean dimming trend of the order of 0.5 Wm2 per
decade is consistent with our current understanding of global
distribution of anthropogenic aerosols (factor of 2).

4) We cannot infer global mean trends from surface stations alone.
Since the dimming decreases strongly from the source regions,
inferring global mean dimming from solely surface stations will
bias towards a significant overestimate of the dimming;

In order to examine dimming trend question further, we
modeled the historical variations in ABCs and their dimming
influence, by including historical variations in emissions of soot and
SO2 in the NCAR climate model (Ramanathan et al., 2005). Fortu-
nately, we had well calibrated solar radiation data over India (12
stations), which was collected by a well-known Indian meteorol-
ogist, Dr Annamani, and incorporated into the GEBA data sets. The
observations revealed that India has steadily been getting dimmer
at least from the 1960s (data record began in the 1960s), and that
India now is about 7% dimmer than the 1960s. Next, the simulations
were able to estimate observations reasonably well, and the
simulations suggested that the cause of the dimming is largely due
to the 4 to 5 fold increase in emissions of soot and SO2 from the
1960s to now.

4.4. Spectral nature of the dimming

During INDOEX, grating spectrometers were deployed on a ship
to measure high-resolution solar spectrum, as the ship traveled in
and out of the plume (Meywerk and Ramanathan, 1999). A spec-
trum of the direct sunlight and the reflected (downwards) solar
radiation were obtained (Fig. 9). The data revealed that the brown
clouds led to a large reduction of sunlight, with the largest reduc-
tion of 40% in UV and visible wavelengths (another indication of
soot absorption).

4.5. Atmospheric solar heating

In addition to absorbing the reflected solar radiation, black
carbon in ABCs absorbs the direct solar radiation and together the

Fig. 9. Global, direct, and diffuse portion of the spectral irradiance for the most pris-
tine day, day 78 (March 19, 1998) at 12S, and the most polluted day, day 85 (March
28, 1998) at 8N. Solar zenith angle for both samples was 30(Meywerk and Ram-
anathan, 1999).

two processes contribute to a significant enhancement of lower
atmosphere solar heating. The atmospheric solar absorption
increase due to ABCs is shown in Fig. 10 (adapted from Chung et al.,
2005). The increase in solar absorption is the vertical integral of the
ABC induced solar absorption from the surface to the TOA; but more
than 95% of this increase is confined to the first 3 km above the
surface where the ABCs are located. Within the regional plumes,
the heating ranges from 10 to 20 Wm2, which is about 25% to 50%
of the background solar heating in the first 3 km. Until recently
there was no direct observational confirmation for such large ABC
heating rates, since it requires multiple aircraft flying in stacked
formation with identical radiometers on the aircraft. This challenge
was recently overcome by deploying 3 light-weight unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) with well calibrated and miniaturized
instruments to measure simultaneously aerosols, black carbon and
spectral as well as broad band radiation fluxes (Ramanathan et al.,
2007a; Ramana et al., 2007; Corrigan et al., 2008). This study
(Ramanathan et al., 2007a) demonstrated that ABCs with a visible
absorption optical depth as low as 0.02, is sufficient to enhance
solar heating of the lower atmosphere (surface to about 3 km) by as
much as 50%. Absorption in the UV, visible and IR wavelengths
contributed to the observed heating rates. If it is solely due to BC,
such large heating rates require BC to be mixed or coated with other
aerosols. Global average ABC solar heating, as per the present
estimate, is 3 Wm2 (Fig. 8) with a factor of 510 larger heating
over the regional hot spots (Fig. 10).

5. Atmospheric brown clouds: global and regional climate
changes

5.1. Magnitude of the missing global warming

The ABC TOA forcing is 1.4 Wm2 (0.5 to 2.5 Wm2). Using
the IPCC climate sensitivity of 1.25 Wm2 C1, we infer that
surface cooling due to ABCs is about 1.2 C (0.4 C to 2 C).
Therefore, the inferred ABC surface cooling effect can account for
the missing surface warming of 1.3 C (discussed in Section 3). The
deduction from this result is that the buildup of GHGs since the pre-
industrial to present has already committed the planet to a surface
warming of 2.4 C, out of which about 0.6 C has already been
realized, and the 0.5 C stored in the oceans will manifest in the
next few decades, and the balance of 1.3 C will be realized if we
eliminate ABCs.

5.2. Global hydrological cycle

As pointed out earlier (Ramanathan et al., 2001b; Wild et al.,
2004, and others), the large reduction of solar radiation at the
surface (4.4 Wm2) will result in reduced evaporation and in
turn reduced precipitation. Of course this will be countered by
increased precipitation from the GHGs warming. It is likely that the
reduction in precipitation will occur in the tropics where the
dimming is the largest and the increase in precipitation will occur
in the extra tropics where the GHGs warming is larger than the
tropical warming.

5.3. Regional hydrological cycle

Of major concern is rainfall over sub-Saharan Africa and the
Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The major emerging theme is that
rainfall in these regions is strongly, if not dominantly, influenced by
latitudinal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, while ABCs play
a major role in influencing the SST gradient. This is because the ABC
dimming is concentrated more in the northern oceans than in the
southern oceans. In the Atlantic, during the 1960s to 1990s, ABCs
from N America and Europe caused major dimming in the northern

part of the Atlantic Ocean, thus potentially reducing the north-
south SST gradient and shifting the rain belt southwards (Rotstayn
and Lohmann, 2002). This has been suggested as the major influ-
ence in causing the Sahelian rainfall (also see Held et al., 2005). For
the ISM, Ramanathan et al. (2005); Meehl et al. (2008) and Lau et al.
(2008) have suggested similar reasons. As noted by Ramanathan
et al. (2005) and Chung and Ramanathan (2006), the summer time
SST gradient has weakened since the 1950s and they attribute this
weakening to the observed reduction in ISM rainfall. According to
Ramanathan et al. (2005) and Meehl et al. (2008), the ABC cooling is
masking the GHGs warming in the northern Indian Ocean (NIO),
such that the NIO is not warming as much as the southern Indian
Ocean in response to the GHGs warming. Additional factors that
contribute to the weakening of the ISM include: reduced evapo-
ration from the NIO due to the dimming; increased atmospheric
stability caused by simultaneous dimming at the surface and
atmospheric solar heating of the lower atmosphere; and reduced
landsea contrast in surface temperatures due to the fact the ABC
dimming is much larger over the land surface (Fig. 7).

As a caveat to the regional climate change discussions above, it
should be pointed out that natural variability due to interactions
between the coupled oceanatmosphereland surface system is
a major source of regional changes on annual and decadal scales.
The ABC induced regional changes described above are inferred
from simulations that include ABC forcing in coupled ocean
atmosphere models. However, these models do not reproduce
many important characteristics of regional climate variability.
Hence, we should treat the ABC effects on monsoon described here
as merely illustrative of the potential effects. The simulations
however suggest that the ABC regional forcing is large enough to
perturb ISM sufficiently that the effects are comparable or larger
than the natural variability of the system.

5.4. Retreat of Hindu Kush-Himalayan-Tibetan (HKHT) glaciers

There is increasing evidence that over two thirds of glaciers in
the HKHT region are retreating more rapidly since the 1950s (e.g.
IPCC, 2007 and references listed therein). This retreat is attributed
to the large warming of the order of 0.25 C per decade that has
been observed since the 1950s over the elevated regions of the
HKHT. It has been generally believed that the warming at elevated
levels is largely due to GHGs warming. However, recent studies
have pointed out that atmospheric solar heating by BC in ABCs is
a major source of warming at the elevated levels (Chung and
Seinfeld, 2002; Ramanathan et al., 2007b; Meehl et al., 2008).
Furthermore, as shown by Ramanathan et al. (2007a) with CALIPSO
Lidar data, about 25 km thick ABCs surround the HKHT region
most of the year and the solar heating by ABCs in this layer is as
much as 25% to 50% of the background solar heating. Model

simulations that employ ABC solar heating demonstrate that the
warming due to ABCs is as large as that due to GHGs forcing (Chung
and Seinfeld, 2002; Ramanathan et al., 2007b; Meehl et al., 2008).

5.5. Retreat of Arctic sea ice

Deposition of black carbon over snow and ice reduces albedo of
these bright surfaces because of enhancement of solar absorption.
Numerous studies have used climate model simulations to suggest
that as much as 50% of the observed retreat in arctic sea ice may be
due to BC forcing (Hansen and Nazarenko, 2004; Flanner et al.,
2007).

6. Conclusion and future directions

6.1. General conclusions

(1) The primary conclusion is that without a proper treatment of
the regional and global effects of ABCs in climate models, it is nearly
impossible to reliably interpret or understand the causal factors for
regional as well as global climate changes during the last century;
(2) until 1950s, the extra-tropical regions played a dominant role in
emissions of aerosols, but since the 1970s the tropical regions have
become major contributors to aerosol emissions, particularly black
carbon. The chemistry and hence the radiative effects of aerosols
emitted in the extra tropics are very different (even possibly in the
sign) from that of the aerosols emitted in the tropics; and as
a result, treatment of ABCs as just sulfate aerosols is inappropriate
for simulating fundamental processes such as dimming and
atmospheric solar heating; (3) the TOA aerosol forcing is an inad-
equate and even an inappropriate metric for understanding the
regional climate changes due to ABCs; (4) Global average dimming
is not an appropriate metric for understanding global average
impacts of ABCs on surface temperature. This is because the TOA
forcing is a factor of 24 smaller than the surface forcing and for
black carbon they are of opposite signs.

6.2. Specific conclusions

1) The missing warming: global average TOA forcing of ABCs is
about 1.4 Wm2. The implication is that, when ABCs are
eliminated, the surface can warm by about 1.3 C.

2) The committed warming: effectively the greenhouse gas
increase from pre-industrial to now has committed the planet
to a surface warming of 2.4 C (using IPCCs central value for
climate sensitivity), and only about 0.6 C of this has been
realized thus far.

3) Global dimming: aerosol observations from satellites, surface
stations and aircraft (for the 20002002 period) suggest that

V. Ramanathan, Y. Feng / Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 3750

47

there is a global wide dimming of about 5 Wm2 due to ABCs.
Assuming negligible dimming before 1900s, this result trans-
lates into a global dimming trend of 0.5 Wm2 per decade,
with factors of 2 or larger dimming trend over land areas. The
ABC induced global mean dimming trend is much smaller than
the 36 Wm2 per decade inferred from radiometers over land
stations.

4) ABC impact over Asia: regionally, ABCs may have played a very
large role in the widespread decrease in precipitation in Africa
and in S. Asia (the Indian summer monsoon) and the wide-
spread retreat of glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan
region. The former is due to dimming and the latter is due to
solar heating of elevated layers by ABCs.

6.3. Future scope for reduction of ABCs

Fig. 11a, b, c and d, show respectively total emissions and per
capita emissions of SO2 and BC for selected nations that include
developed and developing countries. With respect to SO2, China
and USA are the major emitters. Furthermore, we note that in
developed nations (USA, Germany and UK) SO2 emissions have
been reduced significantly, particularly in Germany and UK.
However, the largest per capita SO2 emissions happen in USA,
which suggests the difficulty in eliminating SO2 even in developed
countries. With respect to BC emissions, there is a major shift in
emissions from developed to developing nations in 1990s. In 1980s,
BC emissions in China and Germany were large, but in circa 2000,
China and India emerged as large emitters. However, when we view
the same data in terms of per capita emissions, Germany and UK
were the highest before 1990s, while in circa 2000 USA is the top of
the list, because of large reductions in per capita emissions in
Germany and UK. The Germany emission data is largely influenced
by the merger of East with West Germany. The large reductions in
per capita as well as in total emissions of SO2 in Germany, UK, USA
and other developed nations is the major reason why Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
have emerged as the major contributors to global warming, as
shown by Andronova and Schlesinger (2004).

We are not pointing this out to suggest that reduction of sulfur
emissions is undesirable, but simply note the strong coupling and

feedback effects of air pollution mitigation efforts and global
warming commitment. The second point we wish to note is the
large per capita emissions of BC even in developed nations. This of
course offers options for mitigating global warming, since black
carbon is the second largest contributor to global warming and to
the retreat of arctic sea ice, next to CO2 (e.g., Jacobson, 2002;
Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008). Another point we wish to
convey with the black carbon emission data is the importance of
absorbing aerosols even in developed nations. A rapid reduction of
SO2 emissions without corresponding reductions in black carbon
and greenhouse gases will accelerate the global warming.

We also have to consider the problem in terms of fuel type. Fig. 12
shows contribution of various fuel types to emissions of SO2 and BC. It
is clear that coal is the major source (about 78%) of SO2 emissions.
With respect to emissions of CO2, coal contributed 41% to the total
CO2 emissions in 2005 (International Energy Agency, 2007). Thus it is
likely that the warming effect of coal combustion was either balanced
or exceeded by the cooling effects of its SO2 emissions. The implica-
tion is that burning of fuel oil and natural gas, which emit less CO2
than coal (per unit of energy released), may be the largest contribu-
tors to global warming, because their SO2 emissions are much smaller
than that of coal. With respect to diesel fuel, it contributes as much as
20% to global BC emissions and thus diesel contributes to global
warming both by emitting CO2 and by emitting BC. We are pointing
out the above intersection between air pollution related climate
change effects and greenhouse gas emissions of each fuel type, to
alert to the fact that we need to develop socio-economic-climate
change and impact models on regional to global scales to assess the
real impact of each fuel on global warming.

Since 1979 the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air
Pollution (CLRTAP) has addressed some of the major environmental
problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and
policy negotiation. The CLRTAP has been extended by eight proto-
cols that identify specific measures to be taken by its 51 parties (as
of 2008) to cut their emissions of multiple air pollutants. If the
recent protocol is fully implemented by 2010, the SO2 emissions in
Europe would be cut by at least 63%, together with its NOx emis-
sions by 41%, VOC emissions by 40% and ammonia emissions by
17%, compared to 1990. The CLRTAP also sets tight limit values for
specific emission sources (e.g. combustion plant, electricity
production, dry cleaning, cars and lorries) and requires best

available techniques to be used to keep emissions down. Guidance
documents adopted by the CLRTAP (see reference for further
information) provide a wide range of abatement techniques and
economic instruments for the reduction of emissions in the rele-
vant sectors, which can be shared with the other regions.

The ABC research also offers hope for mitigating ABC effects on
global to regional climate changes and HKHT glacier retreat. It has
identified soot as the major contributor to the negative effects of
ABCs. Fortunately, we have the technology and the financial
resources to significantly reduce soot emissions. Cooking with
wood, coal, and cow dung fires is the major source for soot emis-
sions in many parts of S Asia and East Asia. Replacing such solid fuel
cooking with solar and biogas plants is an attractive alternative. The
lifetime of soot is less than few weeks and as a result the effect of
deployment of the cleaner cookers on the environment will be felt
immediately. To understand the socio-economic-technology chal-
lenges in changing the cooking habits of a vast population (700
million in India alone), we have started Project Surya with engi-
neers, social scientists and NGOs in India. For its pilot phase, Surya
will adopt two rural areas: one in the HHK and the other in the
Indo-Gangetic plains with a population of about 15,000 each and
deploy locally made solar cookers and biogas plants. The unique
feature is that Surya will accurately document the positive impacts
of soot elimination on human health, deposition of soot on the
glaciers, atmospheric heating and surface dimming. Additional
details of Surya can be found in (Ramanathan and Balakrishnan,
2006; http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/ProjectSurya.html).

By improving the living conditions of the rural poor (average
earning is less than 2 $ a day) and by minimizing the negative
health impacts of indoor smoke, Surya is a winwin proposition.
Surya is but one example, of how each one of us must think of
practical and innovative ways for solving the air pollution and
global warming problem. Replacing solid fuel cooking with other
alternative clean energy sources such as solar and biogas plants
may seem promising, but there are sociological and cultural
implications to be considered, particularly since solid fuel has been
used for cooking for centuries. Science has provided us with
immense knowledge of the impact of humans on the climate
system, and we have to use this knowledge to develop practical
solutions that combine behavioral changes with adaptation and
mitigation steps.
