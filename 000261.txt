Introduction to Environmental
Pollution
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Amongst the developing countries, India is the foremost nation to take note of degradation of environment. In 1972, in the world environmental conference held at Stockholm, our government declared that
it is their responsibility to control pollution in India. Even during recent global conference held at
Kyoto in Japan, India accepted the responsibility of reducing global warming and depletion of ozone
layer by banning the use of chloro-fluoro carbons in cryogenic engineering within a stipulated period.
Even in the recent conference held in Rio-de-Janeiro, India declared solidarity by conforming to the
standards as stipulated by United States Environmental Protection Agencies (US-EPA). Perhaps India
was the foremost country in third worlds to implement rigorously pollution legislation both for air and
water. We accepted the stipulated levels of the pollutants in act designated as ‘maximum permissible
level’ to be implemented in successive stages in few years.
Within India, Maharashtra state was the front runner to enact Water Pollution and Control Act in
1962. This was followed by passing of Comprehensive Environmental Protection Bill for prevention of
air pollution in 1983. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh were the first states in Indian union to
have pollution control board with attached analytical laboratories. This was followed by the setting of
series of laboratories in all remaining states of the nation. A legislation was passed. The grave tragedy
of Bhopal in 1984 by accidentally releasing deadly poisonous gas such as methyl isocyanate took a toll
of more than 4500 people who were innocent and helpless. With the growing civilisation and with rise
in traffic, auto-exhaust emission also takes a toll of people. Therefore government enacted ‘PUC’ act to
check every vehicle periodically and control, release of hazardous gases like NO-NOx, CO, and hydrocarbons in air.
As a matter of fact, India did much more than any other developing country could do to control
pollution. Even in controlling global warming and reduction of the Green House gases we were certainly ahead of developed countries like Canada, USA, Australia. General incentives were given by our
government to design and develop indigenously pollution monitoring instruments within the country
and make us self-sufficient. At moment, separate ministry looks after all problems related to pollution.
In fact, all nations have their own ministry or department to implement effectively legislation related to
control of pollution. We have passed act and prevented transportation of hazardous chemicals a big

offence on express highways. The abatement of noise pollution surrounding airports, hospitals was
taken care by our legislation. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was rigorously followed during
setting of new industries and environmental modelling has been used to carry out future foresting of
pollution and resorting to effective control measures of pollution.
Basically, our environment is composed of atmosphere, earth, water and space. In absence of
pollution, it remains clean and enjoyable. The interaction of the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere
and biosphere is continuing for years together. On account of the various activities of man, the composition and complex nature of environment gets changed. These activities include industrialization,
construction, transportation. Such activities, although desirable for human development and welfare,
lead to generation and release of objectionable materials into the environment thus turning it foul, and
rendering our life miserable.
The natural environment is clean, but due to multiferious activities of man it gets polluted resulting
in what is called as environmental pollution. Our main aim should be to keep our environment clean,
by curbing industrial activities. However, in order to keep pace with the rapid industrialisation world
over, a developing country like India cannot afford to arrest its industrial growth. We can select such
industrial processes, which would cause minimum or zero pollution. Further, it is necessary to undertake pollution control measures, so as to enable us to keep our environment as clean as possible.
Our environment is complex. It gets fouled when industrial activities grow. To comprehend this
complex nature of environment, we need knowledge of all disciplines of chemical, physical and biological science. To devise control measures, we need knowledge of engineering and technology. Environmental Science and Engineering is inter-disciplinary in nature. To understand atmosphere we need
knowledge of physics and meteorology, while for knowing hydrosphere and air we need knowledge of
chemistry, the complex behaviour of living organism can be really explained with a knowledge of the
life sciences. The interaction in lithosphere can be best understood from principles of earth science,
while the entire control mechanism can be devised only with intricate knowledge of engineering and
technology. In the process of measurement we collect enormous data, which can be interpreted and
understood only if we are conversant with statistical analysis and computer programming and environmental modelling. Some concerted effort must be made to keep our environment clean. It will lead to
betterment of our lives and peaceful coexistence on the earth.

1.2 WHAT IS POLLUTION?
Our next task to keep the environment clean is to measure the damage caused to it by pollution. Without
understanding the extent of damage caused to our environment due to pollution, it may not be possible
for us to clean it. Such cleaning involves development of suitable control measures. Now these suitable
control measures can be meticulously planned, provided we know what the level of pollution is? Hence,
to understand the level of pollution, we should undertake the analysis or measurement of pollution. This
analysis or measurement is termed as Environmental Pollution Analysis, which will throw light on exact
degree of pollution. It will guide us to recover valuable products from waste and help us to take
appropriate control measures to minimise pollution. With this objective in mind we should try to learn
environment pollution analysis, so as to undertake the analysis, we must know the type of pollution.
Environmental pollution is classified into various groups. For instance, pollution of air is termed as
the atmospheric pollution, the pollution of hydrosphere or water is termed as water pollution, while
pollution due to disposal of waste water is termed as industrial effluents pollution. Similarly, indiscriminate dispersal of domestic sewage or sullage is called domestic effluent pollution. In addition to these
major sources of pollution we have pollution of lithosphere or land, called soil pollution. For instance

Introduction to Environmental Pollution 3

pesticide residue contribute towards soil pollution. Urban areas are blessed with the menace of noise,
which at times becomes intolerable. It is called noise pollution. Some kind of pollution lead to generation of smell or odour; and as such its measurement becomes important. In this chapter, let us have a
glimpse of different kinds of pollution.

1.3 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION
Amongst the various types of pollution, air pollution is of greatest importance. It can be readily noticed
as it causes immediate health problems. The hazardous gases that lead to pollution are oxides of carbon,
nitrogen and sulphur (Table 1.1). Particulate matter also causes air pollution. Table 1.2 indicates level
of suspended particulate matter in cities of India. The emission due to auto-exhaust causes serious
pollution of air due to formation of oxides of nitrogen and benzopyrene. Table 1.3 indicates the level
of BaP i.e. Benzopyrene in various towns of the world, and Table 1.4 shows BaP level at various places
in Mumbai. BaP is generated by incomplete combustion of petrol. This is a serious air pollutant as it

has carcinogenic properties causing lung cancer. The figures refer to pollution noted two-three decades
ago. The present level of pollution is 4-5 times the figures cited.
Noise is another source of pollution. Noise is measured in decibels i.e. dB. Table 1.5 list levels of
noise in general while Table 1.6 gives noise in industrial town and Table 1.7 presents noise level
in Mumbai in various locations, which is domestic noise. The human being can tolerate on an average
45-60 dB without much discomfort, however, beyond this limit it causes mental fatigue, irritation and
other health hazards.

1.4 SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION
We have various sources for air pollution. These are burning of coal and coke, industrial emissions,
commercial activities, thermal power generation unit and last but not the least is transportation. Table
1.8 lists various sources of atmospheric pollution (Fig. 1.1). Table 1.9 indicates as to how much air
pollution is caused by burning sulphur containing fuels. Though wood causes zero pollution, its
calorific value is poor, while fuel oil produces pollution due to SO2 but it has high calorific value.

6 Environmental Pollution Analysis

Transportation is a major source of pollution causing the highest pollution in metropolitan cities in
India. Table 1.10 lists the population of two wheelers in various cities of Maharashtra, while Table 1.11

photochemical smog which is obtained by combination of smoke and fog contributes several pollutants
to air (Figs. 1.2 and 1.3) e.g. CO, CO2, NO–NOx, SO2, Hydrocarbon (HC), etc., as listed in Table 1.12.
A typical petrochemical plant in Gujarat has shown different levels of air borne (SPM) particulate in the
atmosphere (Table 1.13). The thermal power plants in India are responsible for causing extensive air
pollution. A typical thermal power plant in the capital of India throws daily 80 tons of flyash and several
tons of SO2 in the atmosphere. Amongst Indian cities, Delhi and Kanpur have the highest dust fallout,
Mumbai emits highest SO2 emissions, while Kolkata contributes its share by emitting largest proportion
of NO–NOx in the air.

1.5 WATER POLLUTION
Water pollution has been studied in great details. The indiscriminate disposal of water after use in the
form of waste causes water pollution. The tragic incident of Minnamata in Japan is well known. A paper
factory using mercury compounds carelessly dumped its waste effluents into the sea, it formed (CH3)2Hg
and (CH3CH2)2Hg, which in turn was consumed by the sea fish. The Japanese people who consumed
such fish showed symptoms of mercury poisoning like gingivitis, vomiting, fever, diarrhoea, paralysis
of extremities, etc. There were several instances of marine flora and fish dying in the sea, on account
of deoxygenation of water, perhaps due to thermal pollution. Most of the rivers in India are polluted due
to industrial activity. In Mumbai, Ulhas river is polluted due to disposal of effluents from rayon and
dyestuff industries. Some rivers in India with polluting industries shown in parenthesis, are listed:
Ganga (jute, sugar), Sone (paper pulp), Gomati (paper), Yamuna (insecticides), Chaliyar (rayon waste),

Kaveri (rayon, sugar), Godavari (paper, small-scale industries), Mahi (dyestuff), Mullamutha (antibiotics), Brahmaputra (black liquor), Juhari (fertiliser waste), Patalganga (organic chemicals) and Valdhun
(disposal of dye intermediates). It is pardoxial to note that holier is the river, more it is polluted. It is
bound to be polluted due to disposal of industrial effluents in the streams that feed the river. The
Government of India had constituted the Ganga River Authority to keep the Ganges clean. We need
such authority for all principal rivers in India. There exist similar organisations in most developed cities
of the world, e.g. Thames River Authority in England.

1.6 INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENTS
The water after it is used once for industrial purpose cannot be reused for the same purpose without
treatment. Such water which emerges out after use from industries is called as the industrial effluents.
Such effluents have no definite composition, as anything which is not required is carelessly dumped
into its stream. Such unwanted disposable material is contributed by chemical firms, food and beverage
industry, textile and apparel industries, electronics and electrical material industries, or thermal power
plants. The quality of such water is characterised by the study of its various physical, chemical and
biological properties. The disposal of arsenic compounds by paper industry, or toxic chemicals by
fertiliser plant had caused serious problem in western India. In many places, town authorities have not
hesitated to let up sewage into streams or brooks or rivers, presuming that dilution would solve the
pollution problem. Unfortunately, biological matter and bacteria such as coliforma, streptococcii, fecal
coliforma, crenthronix, are not eliminated by mere dilution. Such water needs chemical treatment, like
disinfection. This would also kill pathogenic bacteria.

1.7 POLLUTION DUE TO DOMESTIC EFFLUENTS
Very few cities in India have regular sewage treatment plants. Even major cities like Mumbai, Kolkata
do not have plants to treat all sewage and sludge. Further most of our villages are fitted with antiquited
treatment plants or septic tanks. The growth of slums in bigger metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Kolkata,
Delhi are posing alarming problems of sewage disposal. In fact, the greatest problem that Ganga Water
Authorities had faced during their initial working was the tackling of untreated and indiscriminately
disposed off sewage. The untreated domestic sewage causes serious health problems. Even the cities in
China with largest population are clean, because they have efficient sewage disposal network. The
release of untreated sewage in sea causes serious problem with marine life, e.g. a huge amount of
sardines in Mumbai sea were killed a decade ago (1958) due to release of sewage from a nearby
industrial plant without proper treatment. The oil pollution deteriorates the aquatic marine environment,
as several grades of oil are nondegradable. The oil slick caused due to Gulf War had caused enormous
problem for India and neighbouring countries.

1.8 POLLUTION DUE TO PESTICIDES
Pesticide residue is the definite source of pollution of land and soil. A list of such pesticides in use is
quite lengthy. The most important ones like DDT, malathion, para-malathion, aldrine, dialdrins, cause
a serious problem of land pollution. The characterisation and determination is not simple. Some pesticides have deleterious effect on health. Several of them are carcinogenic and cause long term harmful
effects upon health and hence need urgent analysis.

Introduction to Environmental Pollution 11

1.9 PROBLEM OF SOLID WASTE
The liquid waste was thoroughly investigated by environmentalists, but that is not the case with solid
wastes. As a matter of fact with greater industrialisation, the production of colourful cartons, boxes and
packings for food, beverages, drugs and edible oil, we have an alarming problem of solid waste disposal. The problem is further aggravated due to nondegradable nature of plastic and polymeric materials. A survey was made decades ago in the city of Mumbai on a typical solid waste composed of
garbage, paper, glass, plastic, etc. It was found that animal waste (1500 tons) constitutes the largest
share followed by mineral waste (1100 tons), agricultural waste (550 tons), with household waste of
(250 tons) per year. In comparison, paper (30 tons) and plastic waste (4 tons) was very less. The
methods for disposal of such solid waste are tedious. They are physical compositing incineration and
land filling. All these methods available for their disposal are expensive. Table 1.14 gives percentage of
solid waste in different towns in India as well as in typical cities of America, England, Japan and
Switzerland. Such waste had all components of nature. From Table 1.14 it will be noted that the highest
garbage was encountered in city of Pune, while paper and glass was disposed heavily in American
cities, rags were extensive in Japanese solid waste, while Mumbai headed the list for having maximum
of non-degradable plastic waste.

1.10 METAL POLLUTANTS
We have several elements in the periodic classification, of this few are metals. Fortunately, only 17 of
these metals are toxic. Of these some are commonly utilised metals, while other are less frequently used
and are termed as rare metals. The important toxic metals are: Be, Os, Pt, Hg, T1, V, Te, Co, U, Se, Cd,
Pb, As, Sb, Cr, Ni, Zn, Mn. Their toxicity varies with threshold limiting value (TLV) = 2 μg/m3 to
5000 μg/m3 . This is the maximum or permissable tolerable limit for a human. The different metals have
different degrees of toxicity. Mercury causes tremor, renal disorder; lead causes plumbism, gastric and
colic problems; cadmium is a cumulative poison, it causes anaemia and hepatic disorder; vanadium
causes wheezing dyspnea; arsenic causes skin cancer and dermatitis; osmium causes halo around eyes
and bronchitis, while tellurium consumption gives garlic odour to breath and sweat. Some of these
metals are carcinogenic. They lead to cancer of lung, nose, liver pleura, thyroid. Sources of these metal
pollutants are varying, some of these pollutants are encountered in water and air, effluents, solid waste

12 Environmental Pollution Analysis

and sewage. A reliable method for their characterisation and quantitative determination is needed. They
are emitted out from various sources, e.g. waste water from electroplating industry (Cr, Ni), air emission
from fluorescent lamps (Cd, Be), paint pigment waste (Pb, Cr), auto-exhaust emissions (Pb, Te). It is
imperative to understand their toxic effects upon health, before devising the method for their analysis
and control.

1.11 ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGENS
Apart from metals, several of the organic compounds encountered in environment cause cancer. Their
chemistry is complex and as such it is really difficult to ascertain the mechanism of interaction. 3-4
Benzopyrene (BaP) is one such deadly compound, which causes cancer of lung in industrial areas. BaP
exist in auto-exhaust emissions, incompletely burned tobacco and cigarettes. In Table 1.3 various levels
of BaP in different towns in the world are indicated; a similar list for Mumbai in Table 1.4 is also
available. In a typical winter, the central Mumbai region showed highest level of BaP as 400 μg/m3 due
to location of coal gas manufacturing unit in the Lalbaug one time a labour area of Mumbai. The south
Mumbai had 3.5 μg/m3 while north Mumbai had 1.4 μg/m3. The eastern suburbs of Mumbai had
varying limit of 15-36 μg/m3 due to location of several brick and kiln factories. A consumption of 1000
cigarettes emits 2-122 μg/m3 BaP, which is sufficient to kill a large human population. A survey of the
workers in England working in gas plant, gas retorts with coal or producer gas, crane operators, printers, chimney sweepers, asphalt workers, street cleaners showed that they were largely affected by
cancer of lung. A large number of organic compounds like benzidine, β-napthylamine, 4-aminodiphenyl,
4-dimethylaminobenzene, 4-nitrodiphenyl are all confirmed as carcinogenic compounds.

1.12 CONTROL OF POLLUTION
The environmental pollution is the most burning problem, requiring immediate attention by the society.
A survey of basic needs of man in America revealed the order of preference that people wanted
consideration of issues such as environment, odour, bus fare, parks, employment, noise, medical care,
schools, roads, garden and home. However, they gave top priority to the stoppage of degradation of
their environment in preference to other important issues. In England there was greater awareness since
1952. With the enforcement of clean air act (1968), air was cleaned, while in the USA, Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) was established. In India since 1962 Maharashtra was the first state to
enact Water Pollution Act, followed by preparation of the draft proposal for Air Pollution Control in
1980. Fortunately the Central Government is aware of the problems. It enacted comprehensive
environmental protection bill in 1986 to include legislation on abatement of noise pollution. Mumbai
city was the first to introduce a bill for transportation of hazardous chemicals (1988). In spite of this we
have tragedy of spilling of chemicals on roads. We have now boards for abatement and control of air
and water pollution in every state of India, including union territories. However, these control measures
shall not be effective, unless environmental education is imparted compulsarily from primary school to
college and university level. We have the Department of Environment and Forest of the Central
Government under the Ministry of Environment. Agencies to control environmental pollution will be
effective only if we properly monitor pollution and implement laws governing pollution strictly.

1.13 ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION ANALYSIS
What is the need for monitoring environmental pollution and analyse the data thus collected? This is a
vexing question. One cannot think of control measures unless one knows what is the extent of pollution?

Introduction to Environmental Pollution 13

A lot of awareness can be created about pollution, a great awareness is already there in urban society
in large cities on pollution, but we cannot effectively control pollution in the absence of authentic data
about air pollution, water pollution, water treatment, industrial effluents, sewage management, land and
pesticides pollution or abatement of noise pollution. Such measures can be effective only if we have
reliable data on exact levels of pollution. Such reliable data can be obtained by monitoring of
environmental pollution at site. The knowledge of levels of pollution will enable us to use and adopt
effective, reliable and economic measures for their control. To control pollution, which is growing in
alarming proportion, the most effective way is to analyse environmental pollution and then adopt a
strategy for its control. Therefore, in this book it is envisaged to consider ways and means to analyse
environmental pollution. The modern methods for analysing environment pollution shall be first
considered. This will be followed by overall consideration of industrial toxicology and hygiene due to
inorganic and organic pollutants. It will be followed by discussion on atmospheric pollution and its
measurement, potable water treatment and analysis of water as well as the analysis of industrial waste
effluent. Finally, the methods for characterisation and analysis of sewage and sludge, pesticide residue
and noise pollution shall be considered. A detailed account is presented in few chapters for the analysis
of air pollutants as well as water polluting materials with all minor details on experimental procedure
in the separate chapters.
