applicable to all Parties 

 

  ADOPTION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT 

Proposal by the President 

Draft decision -/CP.21 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decision 1/CP.17 on the establishment of the Ad Hoc Working Group on 

the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, 

Also recalling Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Convention, 

Further recalling relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties, including 

decisions 1/CP.16, 2/CP.18, 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, 

Welcoming the adoption of United Nations General Assembly resolution 

A/RES/70/1, Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in 
particular its goal 13, and the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third 
International Conference on Financing for Development and the adoption of the Sendai 
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 

Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible 

threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation 
by all countries, and their participation in an effective and appropriate international 
response, with a view to accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions,  

Also recognizing that deep reductions in global emissions will be required in order 
to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention and emphasizing the need for urgency 
in addressing climate change,  

Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties 

should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their 
respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples,

local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable 
situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of 
women and intergenerational equity,  

 Also acknowledging the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties 

arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures and, in this regard, 
decisions 5/CP.7, 1/CP.10, 1/CP.16 and 8/CP.17, 

Emphasizing with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap 

between the aggregate effect of Parties mitigation pledges in terms of global annual 
emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with 
holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C, 

Also emphasizing that enhanced pre2020 ambition can lay a solid foundation for 

enhanced post2020 ambition, 

Stressing the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the Convention and its 

Kyoto Protocol in order to enhance pre-2020 ambition,  

Recognizing the urgent need to enhance the provision of finance, technology and 

capacity-building support by developed country Parties, in a predictable manner, to enable 
enhanced pre-2020 action by developing country Parties,  

Emphasizing the enduring benefits of ambitious and early action, including major 

reductions in the cost of future mitigation and adaptation efforts, 

Acknowledging the need to promote universal access to sustainable energy in 

developing countries, in particular in Africa, through the enhanced deployment of 
renewable energy, 

Agreeing to uphold and promote regional and international cooperation in order to 

mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action by all Parties and non-Party 
stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and 
other subnational authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples,

Article 1  

For  the  purpose  of  this  Agreement,  the  definitions  contained  in  Article  1  of  the  Convention  shall  apply.  In 
addition: 

Convention means the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in New York on 9 
May 1992.  

Conference of the Parties means the Conference of the Parties to the Convention. 

Party means a Party to this Agreement. 

Article 2  

This Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims to strengthen 
the  global  response  to  the  threat  of  climate  change,  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development  and  efforts  to 
eradicate poverty, including by:  

(a) 

(b) 

Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and 
to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that 
this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; 

Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and 
low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; 

(c)  Making  finance  flows  consistent  with  a  pathway  towards  low  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  climate-

resilient development.  

2. 

This  Agreement  will  be  implemented  to  reflect  equity  and  the  principle  of  common  but  differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.  

Article 3  

As nationally determined contributions to the global response to climate change, all Parties are to undertake and 
communicate  ambitious  efforts  as  defined  in  Articles  4,  7,  9,  10,  11  and  13  with  the  view  to  achieving  the 
purpose of this Agreement as set out in Article 2. The efforts of all Parties will represent a progression over time, 
while  recognizing  the  need  to  support  developing  country  Parties  for  the  effective  implementation  of  this 
Agreement.  

Article 4  

In  order  to  achieve  the  long-term  temperature  goal  set  out  in  Article  2,  Parties  aim  to  reach  global  peaking  of 
greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country 
Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a 
balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second 
half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate 
poverty.  

Each  Party  shall  prepare,  communicate  and  maintain  successive  nationally  determined  contributions  that  it 
intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures with the aim of achieving the objectives of 
such contributions.  

Each Partys successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the Partys then 
current  nationally  determined  contribution  and  reflect  its  highest  possible  ambition,  reflecting  its  common  but 
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. 

Developed  country  Parties  shall  continue  taking  the  lead  by  undertaking  economy-wide  absolute  emission 
reduction  targets.  Developing  country  Parties  should  continue  enhancing  their  mitigation  efforts,  and  are 
encouraged  to  move  over  time  towards  economy-wide  emission  reduction  or  limitation  targets  in  the  light  of 
different national circumstances.  

Support  shall  be  provided  to  developing  country  Parties  for  the  implementation  of  this  Article,  in  accordance 
with  Articles  9,  10  and  11,  recognizing  that  enhanced  support  for  developing  country  Parties  will  allow  for

approaches  for  the  integral  and  sustainable  management  of  forests,  while  reaffirming  the  importance  of 
incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches. 

Article 6  

Parties  recognize  that  some  Parties  choose  to  pursue  voluntary  cooperation  in  the  implementation  of  their 
nationally determined contributions to allow for higher ambition in their mitigation and adaptation actions and to 
promote sustainable development and environmental integrity. 

Parties  shall,  where  engaging  on  a  voluntary  basis  in  cooperative  approaches  that  involve  the  use  of 
internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions, promote sustainable 
development  and  ensure  environmental  integrity  and  transparency,  including  in  governance,  and  shall  apply 
robust  accounting  to  ensure,  inter  alia,  the  avoidance  of  double  counting,  consistent  with  guidance  adopted  by 
the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.  

The use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes to achieve  nationally determined contributions under 
this Agreement shall be voluntary and authorized by participating Parties. 

A mechanism to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development is 
hereby established under the authority and guidance of the  Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of 
the  Parties  to  the  Paris  Agreement  for  use  by  Parties  on  a  voluntary  basis.  It  shall  be  supervised  by  a  body 
designated  by  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris  Agreement,  and 
shall aim:  

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

To promote the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions while fostering sustainable development; 

To  incentivize  and  facilitate  participation  in  the  mitigation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  public  and 
private entities authorized by a Party; 

To  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  emission  levels  in  the  host  Party,  which  will  benefit  from  mitigation 
activities  resulting  in  emission  reductions  that  can  also  be  used  by  another  Party  to  fulfil  its  nationally 
determined contribution; and 

(d) 

To deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions. 

Emission reductions resulting from the mechanism referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article shall not be used to 
demonstrate  achievement  of  the  host  Partys  nationally  determined  contribution  if  used  by  another  Party  to 
demonstrate achievement of its nationally determined contribution.  

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris  Agreement  shall  ensure  that  a 
share of the proceeds  from activities  under the  mechanism  referred to in paragraph 4 of  this  Article is used to 
cover administrative expenses as well as to assist developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to 
the adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation. 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris  Agreement  shall  adopt  rules, 
modalities and procedures for the mechanism referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article at its first session. 

Parties recognize the importance of integrated, holistic and balanced non-market approaches being available to 
Parties to assist in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions, in the context of sustainable 
development  and  poverty  eradication,  in  a  coordinated  and  effective  manner,  including  through,  inter  alia, 
mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as appropriate. These approaches shall 
aim to: 

(a) 

(b) 

Promote mitigation and adaptation ambition; 

Enhance  public  and  private  participation  in  the  implementation  of  nationally  determined  contributions; 
and 

(c) 

Enable opportunities for coordination across instruments and relevant institutional arrangements.  

9. 

A  framework  for  non-market  approaches  to  sustainable  development  is  hereby  defined  to  promote  the  non-
market approaches referred to in paragraph 8 of this Article.

Article 7 

Parties  hereby  establish  the  global  goal  on  adaptation  of  enhancing  adaptive  capacity,  strengthening  resilience 
and  reducing  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  with  a  view  to  contributing  to  sustainable  development  and 
ensuring an adequate adaptation response in the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2. 

Parties recognize that adaptation is a global challenge faced by all with local, subnational, national, regional and 
international  dimensions,  and  that  it  is  a  key  component  of  and  makes  a  contribution  to  the  long-term  global 
response  to  climate  change  to  protect  people,  livelihoods  and  ecosystems,  taking  into  account  the  urgent  and 
immediate  needs  of  those  developing  country  Parties  that  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  adverse  effects  of 
climate change. 

The adaptation efforts of developing country Parties shall be recognized, in accordance with the modalities to be 
adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement at its first 
session. 

Parties  recognize  that  the  current  need  for  adaptation  is  significant  and  that  greater  levels  of  mitigation  can 
reduce the need for additional adaptation efforts, and that greater adaptation needs can involve greater adaptation 
costs. 

Parties acknowledge that adaptation action should follow a country-driven, gender-responsive, participatory and 
fully  transparent  approach,  taking  into  consideration  vulnerable  groups,  communities  and  ecosystems,  and 
should  be  based  on  and  guided  by  the  best  available  science  and,  as  appropriate,  traditional  knowledge, 
knowledge  of  indigenous  peoples  and  local  knowledge  systems,  with  a  view  to  integrating  adaptation  into 
relevant socioeconomic and environmental policies and actions, where appropriate. 

Parties  recognize  the  importance  of  support  for  and  international  cooperation  on  adaptation  efforts  and  the 
importance of taking into account the needs of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.
