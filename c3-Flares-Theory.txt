Solar Flares

 

 

Solar Flare

 A solar flare is a sudden brightening of solar atmosphere 

(photosphere, chromosphere and  corona)

 Flares release 1027 - 1032 ergs energy in tens of minutes. 
(Note: one H-bomb: 10 million TNT = 5.0 X 1023 ergs)

 A flare produces enhanced emission in all wavelengths across 

the EM spectrum, including radio, optical, UV, soft X-rays, hard 
X-rays, and -rays

 Flare emissions are caused by 
      -   hot plasma  emitting in: radio, visible, UV, soft X-ray
       -non-thermal energetic particles emitting in: radio, hard X-

ray, -rays

Flare: Temporal Evolution

 A flare may have three phases:   

 Preflare phase: sometimes
 Impulsive phase: e.g., 10 min from 13:56 UT  14:06 UT
 Gradual phase:  e.g., many hours after 14:06 UT

 see Golub & Pasachoff, The Solar Corona, pag.288

 

 

Flare: Temporal Evolution
 Pre-flare phase: flare trigger phase leading to the major 
energy release. It shows slow increase of soft X-ray flux

 Impulsive phase: the flare main energy release phase. It is 

most evident in hard X-ray, -ray emission and radio 
microwave emission. The soft X-ray flux rises rapidly during 
this phase

 Gradual phase: no further emission in hard X-ray, and the 

soft X-ray flux starts to decrease gradually.
 Loop arcade (or arch) starts to appear in this phase

Potential and non-potential magnetic 

field

From Maxwells equations (neglecting displacement current):      

curl B = J

where B = magnetic flux density and J is the current.

When there is no current, 

curl B = 0,    so B = grad 

i.e. B can be expressed in terms of a potential . 

There is zero energy available from a potential field. 

Flares derive their energy from non-potential magnetic 
fields (i.e. from currents).

The magnetic force can be resolved into two conceptually 
simple components:
 A force perpendicular to the B-field which has the form of a 
pressure (it is the gradient of a scalar quantity B2/2m 0), and
 A force towards the instantaneous centre of curvature that 

depends on: i) radius of curvature and ii) field strength B. This 
is equivalent to a tension force acting along the field lines.
Thus forcing the field lines together results in an opposing 
perpendicular pressure force, while trying to bend the field 
lines results in an opposing tension force.

1B11 MHD waves

  This magnetic pressure and magnetic tension represent two 
kinds of restoring force that arise in a plasma in the presence  of 
a magnetic field. 

They are associated to wave modes: waves and perturbations  
that propagate in the plasma.

Most important ones:

1) Alfven waves
2) Magnetosonic wave modes,  in which both the 

magnetic field strength and the plasma pressure vary. 

 

 

1B11 MHD waves

  The Alfven wave is a very important one. It is entirely  due to 
the tension force associated with the magnetic field. 





It is essentially a magnetic wave, as there is no associated 
compression of the plasma as in the case of sonic (pressure) 
waves. 
It propagates preferentially along the field direction (and not 
across it) with speed:

Magnetic Reconnection

 

 

Magnetic Reconnection

 Magnetic fields with opposite polarities are pushed together
 At the boundary, B  0.

 Called diffusion region, since plasma  could cross B

 

 

A simple example of magnetic reconnection. 
Two field lines of opposing polarity are  forced together. 
When they meet they reconnect and snap back into a lower energy 
configuration. 
The upper loop is ejected into space, dragging plasma with it.

 

 

1B11 Magnetic reconnection

If there is a strong B-field gradient 
and the fields on either side of the 
gradient  are anti-parallel, then 
diffusion of the field at the gradient 
can led to a loss of total magnetic flux 

this situation is called magnetic 

annihilation. 

Field lines are convected into the 
diffusion region and merge with field 
lines with opposite orientation (which 
originally where on the other side of 
the gradient)

1B11 Magnetic reconnection

  The resulting reconnected lines 
are sharply bent through the 
current sheet.

Magnetic tension forces 
associated with these bent lines 
accelerate the plasma along the 
current sheet and away from the 
diffusion region on each side.

 Rate of change of field in a flare volume =

Get an order-of-magnitude estimate of quantities by 

approximating 

/t = 1 / t,  curl = 1 / L,  2 = 1 / L2:
If there is no convective term, then:     B/D = B / (L2  0) 
or diffusion time, 

    D = L2  0.

may be relatively small:

The basic problem is that high-temperature coronal plasma,
especially for flares, has an extremely large electrical 
conductivity  (comparable to the conductivity of solid 
copper at room temperature). 

So the energy release timescale appears to be of the order 
of years rather than the observed seconds or minutes.

 

 

diffusion time, 
The classical value of conductivity is 

    D = L2  0.

      = 10-3 Te

3/2 S.I. units

 where Te = electron temperature. For the quiet corona, Te = 2 MK, 

so  = 2.8   106 S.I. units. 

(Solid copper has  = 5  107 S.I. units.)

 

 

So the diffusive time scale D for the pre-flare volume (take this to 

be L = 1,000 km = 106 m) is possibly as high as ~3.1012 s 
(billions of years). 

However, these simple estimates must be wrong for actual flares. 

It is likely that L ~ a few metres, not the observed flare 
dimensions which represent the aftermath of a flare, not the 
magnetic field diffusion region.

Petschek reconnection occurs if the anomalous resistivity sets in on 
the current sheet . 
Possible only for peculiar current sheet thickness
current sheet thinning via the "fractal tearing instability" (Tanuma 
2000; Shibata & Tanuma 2001; Tanuma et al. 2001a).  

 

 

the tearing mode gives rise to the formation of a magnetic 
island. 
Field-lines inside the separatrix have been broken and 
reconnected, and now possess quite different topology. 

 

 

Both the tearing-type and the Petschek-type 
reconnectionsdevelop from an initially antiparallel magnetic 
field.
 
In the tearing-type field geometry the current-sheet plasma, 
accelerated at X-type neutral points through reconnection, 
cannot be ejected away from the system but is confined in the 
resulting magnetic islands. 

On the other hand, in the Petschek-type field geometry the 
plasma can freely be ejected away from the system, so that the 
antiparallel field is allowed to collapse into the X-type neutral 
point.

Internal Shocks in Reconnection Jet

 We suggest that the internal shocks could be created in 
the reconnection jet by the secondary tearing instability.
 And the energetic electrons could be accelerated in the 

internal shocks.
