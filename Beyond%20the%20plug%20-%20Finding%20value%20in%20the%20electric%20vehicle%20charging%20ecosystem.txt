Beyond the plug: fi nding value in the emerging electric vehicle charging ecosystem

Ready, set, charge!

The rise of battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) will entail the development of a vast 
amount of new infrastructure, particularly charging stations. Although the deployment of this 
infrastructure undoubtedly represents a market opportunity, the size of it is still diffi cult to 
estimate. Who owns the value created by the emerging EV business strategy is also still unclear. 
Despite initial scale advantages, small players who have what turns out to be the right solution 
may displace large players who make a bad choice.

This may become clear soon, either because of technological advances or through the market 
pressure of early entrants who prove most adept at executing their plan. If it does, the entire 
industry will benefi t. However, should the uncertainty over the charging station business linger, 
it could slow down the evolution of the entire industry, and possibly even jeopardize its advance 
for decades. 

In this document, we hope to shed some light on the charging infrastructures evolving value 
chain  its shape, its potential risk and possibilities for value-creation. 

We dont have all the answers  at this juncture, no one does  but we hope our analysis will help 
lead you to ask the right questions about your companys response to the introduction of EVs.  
The roll out of EV charging infrastructure is essential to mass adoption of EVs and therefore 
could prove to be a huge social, political and economic change every bit as important to our 
society as the introduction of the internal combustion-powered automobile. Whether you decide 
to wait, enter or expand your investment in this exciting new and growing market, we hope this 
report will help you frame your view. We look forward to your feedback.

Executive summary

The charging infrastructure necessary to stimulate widespread adoption of increasingly available EVs in the marketplace remains to be built. As the 
mainstream OEMs begin to roll out EVs, the role of charging infrastructure evolves from being an awareness tool to becoming a commercially viable 
business venture.
 
The billion dollar question today is: How can companies package a commercially viable proposition and differentiate themselves in a non-existent, 
yet crowded marketplace?
 
Worldwide, we have identifi ed 143 companies that have staked a claim to the emerging EV charging infrastructure, but despite all their ingenuity 
and activity, the shape of the value chain is still unclear. To try to decipher this chain, we closely analyzed these companies and chose 18 distinct 
business activities that were grouped to develop fi ve potential business strategy variants. These business strategies are at different levels of 
complexity within the value chain and consequently, bring different risks and rewards to the participants.

Beyond the plug: fi nding value in the emerging electric vehicle charging ecosystem

  Several players have not considered the role OEMs and energy utilities will play in this emerging ecosystem, and until these two central 

stakeholders decide where they want to sit, a stable value chain is unlikely to emerge.

  Charging station companies in the upper end of the value chain propose services that could be claimed by other, more natural players.
  To be a fast-mover is critical, but does not necessarily secure a market share. Manufacturing charging hardware will rapidly become a high-

volume, low-margin business. 

The fi ve business strategies will evolve to maturity following different timetables as they face different barriers to entry. Some companies intend to 
operate in several of them at once, or even to be active in all of them, such as the company Better Place for instance.
 
Segmenting 143 business strategies allowed us to make several fi ndings, some of which are presented in this report. Generally, we observe that:
 
  Most companies advertise that they offer solutions for a wide range of customers  from utilities to car rentals, to hotels and home users  but 

lack a differentiated package and convincing revenue model.

  Other segments of the EV charging value chain are likely to invest on services that can be offered by leveraging the growing network of charging 

stations.  Overall, the biggest revenue opportunities will probably go to large-scale players or nimble startups who can reach scale rapidly.

  The emergence of the EV charging infrastructure will likely force OEMs to take a different look at managing the customer relationship. Some 

OEMs already recognize the challenge and are turning it into an opportunity.

 
The growth of the EV charging infrastructure is set to be an exciting chapter in the vehicle electrifi cation 
process. The purpose of this analysis is to help read the market as it evolves, and also provide an initial 
assessment of the risks and rewards it presents.

The current state of the charging industry 

Government and industry players both 
see scale and interoperability as a key 
to a successful roll out. Some analysts 
believe failure to coordinate this system 
could set adoption back 10 years. 
However, to implement an appropriate 
EV charging infrastructure does not 
necessarily mean mandating an outlet at 
every street corner. It means creating a 
profi table industry where the economics 
are profi table and self-sustaining to 
justify the investment as the market 
develops.

Overall market 
At the moment, stakeholders continue to wrangle over standards, each 
championing a favorite solution. Behind the scenes, some governments 
are trying to decide how involved they want to be in the roll out and 
whether they need to intervene. 

As described in our section on regional development, market strategies 
differ signifi cantly between Asia, North America and Europe, and those 
differences may harden into different regional standards, slowing growth 
for all.  

Customer focus
The most common charging confi guration is likely to be chargers at 
both home and work. However, we identifi ed several other potential 
customers such as hotels and restaurants, car rental/sharing, fl eet 
managers and gas stations. One emerging obstacle: an unarticulated 
value proposition for potential hosts of charging stations, such as 
parking lot owners.

Disruptive threats
Barrier to entry is low. New entrants may emerge from multiple 
industries. The market also faces several possible substitutes that could 
jeopardize several business strategies. 

Supplier power
At this stage, suppliers are strong players in the value chain. Some 
have already moved up the value chain and become manufacturers of 
charging infrastructure through strategic partnering.

Beyond the plug: fi nding value in the emerging electric vehicle charging ecosystem

Introducing the EV charging value chain

The basic elements of the emerging EV charging value chain are 
clear. It must transfer energy from an outlet to a vehicle. It must track 
information of the energy provider and the energy recipient. It must 
include a payment system easy for the consumer to understand and 
easy for the energy distributor to integrate within pre-existing billing 
systems  and of course, it must meet government regulations and 
carmaker requirements.  

However, a number of important elements remain fuzzy. 
  How soon will EVs become a mass-market phenomenon - or should 

we ask: How far away is this from happening? 

  What will the plug sizes be? 
  Some charging standards are not yet globally approved. 
  Whether EV charging should connect to a smart grid is an open 

debate.

  Some possible service offerings are contingent on the development 

of the smart grid, but should the initial network be built with this 
compatibility in mind?

  Where are the boundaries between the different stakeholders in the 

charging infrastructure?

  What are the commercial risks and rewards of building, owning 

or operating various products and services in the charging 
infrastructure?

  What are the potential revenue streams and the associated risks, and 

what business strategy is best placed to capture them?

  What are the capital and operating costs associated with the charging 

infrastructure?

For the purpose of this analysis, we envision the EV charging value chain 
as a combination of four spheres inter-connected by over 18 activities. 
1  The charging infrastructure sphere comprises all services ranging 
from manufacturing the charging stations to setting up the physical 
infrastructure and managing the delivery of energy through the 
network of charging stations. 

2  The utility sphere involves activities ranging from generating and 

distributing energy to billing the end-user for consumption. 

3  The OEM sphere comprises all activities associated with the vehicle, 
ranging from selling to maintenance, operating and up to the end of 
its life cycle. 

4  These three spheres revolve around the customer sphere, which is 
the private or business user of EVs, and encompasses the services 
they need over their ownership cycle of the vehicle. 

A further dimension of analysis is that the 18 distinct activities critical 
to the EV charging value chain have been differentiated based on 
being a product (hardware or software) or a service (single or multi-
year contract).

Based on an analysis of 143 companies that 
offer a product or service to the EV charging 
infrastructure, we have identifi ed 18 distinct 
activities that are directly relevant for 
the functioning of the EV ecosystem. By 
looking at existing patterns and the most 
likely trajectories of development, we 
have derived the fi ve potential charging 
infrastructure business strategies.

Searching for a sweet spot
Five possible business strategy variants are likely to co-exist

Industry structures develop in particular 
ways for two reasons  either around 
the needs of the customer or around 
the convenience of the supplier. The EV 
charging value chain will be no exception.

Each of these models moves up the value 
chain from the most basic elements (hardware 
manufacturers) to the most high value (EV 
maintenance contracts). Yet from the second step 
up, these businesses may own or outsource the 
lower-value elements. Indeed, the station itself 
may just be a positive externality, with the players 
value partly derived by their understanding of or 
proximity to charging station architecture.

None of these fi ve strike us as having breakthrough value propositions. 
Most have relatively low barriers to entry. Few look stable and 
defensible. As a result, we believe that this is a business that will be won 
or lost early, and conducted on a grand scale. It may be possible to gain 
leverage through some kind of real estate-like component, much like 
other recent physical technology roll outs, such as cell phone coverage 
and cable TV, but only to a player able to cultivate good relationships 
with power companies, municipalities and parking lot owners. 

Next, well look at these fi ve possibilities, and assess the risks and reward 
profi les of each business strategy.

Business strategy one: the builder 

The builder. This player would simply create the infrastructure 
hardware necessary for charging batteries in an urban, residential 
or corporate setting. The operations of both the vehicles and the 
electrical companies would be beyond its scope  a bit, perhaps, like an 
internet modem developer.  
 
Any infrastructure involving high-voltage connections is likely to be 
highly regulated, which means that the technology itself could not be 
used as a barrier to entry. Two possible exceptions:  
a) if regulatory certifi cation for safety reason limits new entrants, or 
b) if another player in the value chain, such as a vehicle OEM or a power 
company, supporting a particular candidate as an industry standard can 
lock out other players.

Opportunities
  Tangible demand for charging devices is expected 

in the next three to fi ve years.

  The unbranded charging station market can be 

attractive if the device is to be constantly updated 
with leading-edge technology and design.
  The right partnership with an OEM or city 
administration may prove very profi table. 

Threats
  Companies active in this sector will face the 

commodity challenge: low cost/high volume but 
will also have to revamp their product to stay in 
business, which is to be capital intensive.

  Potential alternate technologies such as induction 
charging can replace need for standard charging 
stations.

  Low-tech nature of hardware reduces 

differentiation and competitive advantage.

  Selling charging stations as such will limit the 
target audience signifi cantly in the mid-term 
because several users will require more than 
a device to satisfy their needs (they will need 
network connection, billing capability, etc.).
  High exposure to supply chain may cause a 

supplier to become a competitor.

  Higher capital expenditure will be a heavy 

burden for independent players with low market 
capitalization.

Our takeaway
  Business strategies that rely exclusively on hardware charging stations are not likely to keep up with the pace of change in the market.  

Players in this area will need an important strategic partner to succeed.

  Builders will have few opportunities for differentiation outside specifi c regional voltage requirements. True advantages are more 

likely to grow out of alliances with OEMs, but this is a rapidly diminishing opportunity. We recommend that the builder seek a specifi c 
customer target niche and customize its offering based on explicit needs it might have. 

  Devices could be customized for particular specialty niches.
  In collaboration with city administrations, charging stations may be set up near metro and public transportation stations, integrating 

  Rather than concentrate on permanent facilities, some entrants might develop portable charging stations that EV owners could take 

EVs into the municipal transportation scheme.   

with them, reducing the need for permanent infrastructure.

  Companies operating this business strategy may choose to own, outsource or even have a panel of banded  unbranded charging 

station manufacturers.

The maintenance-installer.  This company would install and then 
manage the operational reliability of charging stations. This might 
sound a little like the fi lling stations of today, but the special nature 
of battery charging (i.e., it may take hours) will likely demand a very 
different kind of infrastructure, perhaps integrated into parking lots. 
 
For home installation, the low maintenance that such facilities will 
require and the lack of differentiation would likely limit the possibilities 
to build customer loyalty. 
 
This is a very different story for owners of public/semi-public charging 
networks. Maintenance contracts are signifi cantly more important for 
them as downtime will result in lost revenues.

Opportunities
  Home chargers that can be installed with fewer 

additional electrical upgrades than other charging 
solutions have strong potential moving forward.
  The growing need to educate buyers may open 
up new business opportunities surrounding the 
business of the maintenance-installer: while 
retailing, installing or servicing charging device, 
supporting utilities in energy saving campaigns 
may, for instance, generate new business.

Threats
  In the US, home installation projects have so 

far proven time consuming and more risky than 
initially anticipated.

  The maintenance-installer will fi nd it hard 

to expand geographically. It will have to 
comply with installation regulations and 
service requirements that are likely to vary 
signifi cantly by region, at least until the market 
is established.

  This market niche is also likely to disappear 
for some target markets (for instance home 
charging), as utilities may decide  to bundle it 
into their service package.

  Selling charging station as such limits the target 
audience signifi cantly as it access only a limited 
number of stakeholders in the value chain.

Our takeaway
  The value of maintenance contracts may increase over the years as the number of charging stations in operation is likely to expand in the future.
  Charging stations are set to evolve rapidly, which will also force the maintenance-installer to constantly adjust its service offering.
  It is diffi cult to imagine EV consumer ownership without a home electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) installation. Both will have to be carefully 

coordinated to avoid disappointment among enthusiastic early adopters.

  The maintenance-installer is best positioned to help accelerate standardization. It should carefully navigate the risk associated with the lack of 

standardization in order to manage inventories while providing ready services.

  Strategic combination of installation device with a green energy supply or off-peak energy management support may attract 

environmentally aware consumers. For instance, some stations may generate on-site power from green energy sources built into the 
structure, such as photovoltaic panels.

  Investments in technicians merged with a good service model are to be strong differentiator in the market.

Business strategy three: the broker-operator

The broker-operator. Beyond installing and maintaining the charging 
stations, the broker-operator would manage the energy delivery as 
well. This company would manage the energy use, the costs of that 
energy and the amount that needs to be billed to the customer. 
 
One of the broker-operators key strengths lies in its managing and 
monitoring abilities. One partial segment to this business strategy 
may be to companies that provide the tracking analytics for cell phone 
usage. However, the business may be more compelling than that.  As a 
middleman, the company would be in a position to extract better terms 
with both the utility and the consumer, or at the very least, create 
analytics that could add value to power companies. This additional data 
could also be used to create bundled offerings based on a households 
complete energy consumption profi le.

Companies operating this business strategy may 
choose to own, outsource or even have a panel of 
partners for activities 1 through 5.

Opportunities
  The broker-operator has a wide array of service to 
be packaged for an extensive range of customers. 

  Need to educate buyer: currently, it is hard 

to imagine that potential EV charging station 
buyers can see a compelling reason to enter 
this business. The broker-operator should be 
able to help understand how to monetize the 
opportunities at hand, thereby strengthening its 
role in the value chain.

  Buyers need to have a network connection in 

place to purchase charging station without data 
management processor.

Threats
  Revenue models are not yet fully tested  for all 

activities offered by the broker-operator.

  Potential buyers are likely to expect several 

services to be free.

  Some of the services will be core propositions for 

other stakeholders in the EV industry.

Our takeaway
  The key competence owned by the broker-operator is the ability to involve billing to the charging process. One of the broker-operators 

strengths and value in the market will therefore be to help identify and quantify the value of a potential charging infrastructure 
project. But billing as such may also become a commodity and should not be considered as an ultimate safety net against other 
business strategies as car makers might end up having compelling mechanisms on board via telematics. One way to counter that risk 
could be to seek an active role in the telematic industry, thereby solidifying a function for OEMs.

  The business of the broker-operator requires signifi cant investment in systems and communications tools.
  The diagnostic capabilities of the broker-operator may also be useful to insurance companies and other data-centric businesses.
  The broker-operator will fi nd it hard to cover all business highlighted under his activity set; success will depend on strong alliances 

with energy companies, many of which tend toward non-entrepreneurial cultures.

Business strategy four: the gridmaster 

The gridmaster. This player would also manage energy, but in a 
different way. Beyond monitoring the charging process, the gridmaster 
would use the batteries of parked cars as a resource.  
 
One of the most diffi cult aspects of electric energy production is that 
most energy is generated for immediate use, not for use at a later date. 
As a result, generators producing energy must be able to handle the 
highest peak load times even if most of these spikes are infrequent. 
Renewable energy has this problem as well in that the amount of energy 
created by the most popular renewables - such as solar or wind - vary 
tremendously, and they are not always in synch with usage peaks.
 
A gridmaster would help lessen these twin problems by making the 
entire network more effi cient, using these parked car batteries to fi rst 
store and then draw down energy to help smooth load requirements. 
 
This market player provides energy storage and generation solutions, 
as well as off-grid or off-peak charging  with a premium paid for 
convenience. 

Companies operating this business strategy may 
choose to own, outsource or even have a panel of 
partners for activities 1 through 13.

Our takeaway
  Creating an EV charging infrastructure is an ambitious goal. Building a smart grid is equally ambitious. To do both at the same time 

might multiply the value of each but will also increase the magnitude of investment and managerial effort required. 

  Given the lack of understanding of market demand and ROI, companies focusing on a smart grid deployment will need to work closely 
with companies that can help make smart grid adoption more affordable and immediately appealing to utilities. One example would be 
to seek an alliance with data management software makers who can demonstrate a clear ROI.

  In the end, the gridmasters success will depend on the creation of a three-sided value proposition that appeals as much to the 

automobile OEM and the power provider as to the consumer.
  Standard-setting could create a barrier to entry in this sector.
  The role at the utility level may help secure business immediately.
  Trading green energy credits to support EV charging with renewable sources will be an attractive complement for the gridmaster 

once this market establishes.

Business strategy fi ve: the guardian

The guardian. With or without ownership of the back-end power 
infrastructure, the guardian extends its service offering to the owner 
of the EV (business or private), in addition to other stakeholders in 
the EV charging ecosystem.

At this stage, the key differentiators from other business strategies 
are the value-added services that may be peripheral to the charging 
infrastructure, but are critical in the overall EV ecosystem.

In particular, the guardian has a more strategic role in the 
management of the charging network, and therefore exposure to 
greater risks (as well as upside potential) compared to the broker-
operator, which is a relatively back-end operations management role. 

Companies operating this business strategy may 
choose to own, outsource or even have a panel of 
partners for activities 1 through 14.

Opportunities
  No other opportunity touches so many different 

industries as the guardians business strategy, 
which will touch the OEM, telecom, software 
and even insurance industries. Controlling the 
record of the EVs operation and the data fl ows 
surrounding its operation, the value of the 
guardian could combine the usefulness of building 
control systems and buyer loyalty cards with 
the potential to be a kind of app store for your 
vehicle. 

  The guardian has the unique opportunity to 

customize the vehicle and energy access package 
based on the customer  business or private.

  Unlike other business strategies, the guardian can 
help establish regional and (or) national standards 
for the charging infrastructure, and manage a 
network of gridmasters and broker-operators.

Threats
  OEMs are increasingly moving toward a 

service offering that might compete with the 
activity set of the guardian.

  Demand for these services might be different 

than current market developments suggest.
  Concerns about privacy might lead to limits 

on the data harvest.

Regional developments in the EV charging infrastructure
North America

Initiatives and 
projects 

Government and 
industry support 

  Coulomb is beginning to roll out a projected 4,600 charging station network in Austin, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, 

Orlando, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, Redmond and Washington D.C., supported by three leading OEMs: 
Ford, GM and smartUSA. 

  GE, both a big corporate energy buyer and a technology producer, now says it favors the development of Level 2 fast-

charging with networked information. 

  Fleet owners will likely be the early adopters. Coulombs customers to date are mostly business (39%), municipalities 

(37%) and automakers (2%). 

  Energy companies are still largely uninvolved in the emerging EV charging market, partly because they are limited 

by regulation. This is somewhat worrisome as the biggest revenue opportunities are likely to be in the energy 
management of charging.

  Schneider Electric, another major electrical parts supplier, recently announced its own total EV charging solution. 

  The EV Project is probably the largest initiative to date supporting vehicle electrifi cation and charging infrastructure 
deployment. The 36-month project started in 2009 with ECOtality awarded a US$99.8 million dollar grant from the 
U.S. Department of Energy. With various partners involved, the value of the project is approximately US$230 million. 
The goal is to deploy over 14,000 chargers in 18 major cities and metropolitan areas located in six states of the 
United States. Qualifying EV drivers will receive a residential charger at no cost. Perhaps even more importantly, the 
EV Project will collect and analyze data that are to evaluate the effectiveness of charging infrastructure, and conduct 
trials of various revenue systems for commercial and public charging infrastructures. These lessons learned will be of 
unmatched value once shared with the broader community. (www.theevproject.com/)

  Deregulation among utilities needs to happen now in order to create sustainable business context for charging station 

companies in the near future. Unlike Europe, utility commissions in the US do not seem to have appropriate market 
understanding  and fl exibility to support more rapid expansion of an EV charging infrastructure. 

Potentially 
disruptive 
projects

  GE is installing its own charging stations to supply the need generated by the several thousand EVs it plans to 

purchase. Such market-making activities require a high degree of cooperation between manufacturers and producers.
  At its Mountain View, CA., headquarters, Google is letting a startup called Plugless Power install an inductive system 

that will charge electric car batteries wirelessly, across an air gap.   

  Lear, a GM Volt supplier, is marketing a Volter, a charging station and portable charging cordset for the Chevrolet 

Volt.

  At the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, ABB introduced a CHAdeMO-compliant fast-charger DC prototype that charges 

more than ten times as fast as a conventional charger. At the same show, it unveiled an AC standard charger.

  London is rapidly becoming a charging capital. By 2013, an estimated 1,300 publicly accessible charging stations will 
be installed around the city. This spring, Hertz added electric cars to its London fl eet, and set up its own network of 16 
charging stations. 

  UK charging station startup Chargemaster has announced experiments with an interoperable radio-frequency 

identifi cation (RFID) card that allows drivers to recharge in several cities. 

  The Green eMotion project, an initiative of the European Commission and 42 partners from industry, the energy 

sector, EV manufacturers, municipalities, universities and research institutions, is working to develop and to 
demonstrate a commonly accepted and user-friendly framework consisting of interoperable and scalable technical 
solutions in connection with a sustainable business platform. Possibly included in the framework:  smart grid 
developments and urban mobility concepts. The four-year project started in March 2011. (www.greenemotion-
project.eu)

  As opposed to energy producers elsewhere, European utilities like the idea of using charging stations as a strategic 

tool (to expand geographically or build customer relationships).

Regional developments in the EV charging infrastructure
Asia

 

In China, State Grid Corporation, the dominant power distributor, plans to build more than 2,350 EV charging stations 
and 220,000 charging poles by 2015. 

  The CHAdeMO initiative, an association created by TEPCO, a Japanese utility and now involving several car makers, is 

currently working on establishing a global charging standard for DC quick charge.

  According to Chinas draft energy vehicle development plan 2011-20, EV pilot cities should include vehicle charging 
facilities in their overall city construction plan with charging facilities installed for no less than 20% of new public and 
community parking spaces.

  China Southern Grid and Better Place have signed a strategic agreement on battery swapping in April 2011 to 

promote battery swapping in China.

  Chinese local governments are very actively supporting charging facilities construction. Over 100 charging stations 

were installed in at least fi ve major cities since 2010.

  State Grid and China Southern Grid are the only two power distributors in China. Considering their monopoly position, 
fi nancial strength and government backing, the fact that these two companies are now promoting  battery swapping 
could prove to be disruptive for China and eventually for the world because of Chinas share of the global auto sector.

Beyond the plug: fi nding value in the emerging electric vehicle charging ecosystem

Despite the activity, disruptive technologies could slow the development 
of charging systems
Several companies currently participating in the Implementation of the EV charging infrastructure industry may see their value proposition jeopardized 
by disruptive players who could potentially emerge in the market place at a faster pace than anticipated. For example:

Battery improvements
Battery technologies will continue to evolve quickly. Signifi cant battery 
performance improvements are likely to extend capacity between 
charges and (or) the speed of recharging. This could modify distance 
between charging stations and the overall density of the infrastructure.

Evolving charging technology
Charging technologies are still being developed. DC charging, for 
instance, is already considered for Level One and Two charging. 
New generations of fast charging are also likely to rapidly emerge in 
the marketplace.

Battery swapping
Alongside the battery, battery swapping should not be underestimated 
as an option. It is currently witnessing a lot of attention in China, and 
given the magnitude of this countrys potential demand and research 
intensity, it may play a role in the EV charging environment in the future.

Expansion of onboard vehicle systems
Software applications operating on an in-vehicle information system or 
mobile device are designed to enhance safety, connectivity and mobility. 
They could also provide solutions overlapping with the service portfolio 
of advanced charging station companies.

Inductive charging
Inductive charging is not currently affordable, safe or effi cient, but is 
being investigated as a charging solution among key companies and 
countries. Requiring no wires or other connections, inductive charging  
could represent a signifi cant safety improvement, and could signifi cantly 
reduce the market as it would probably share the same customer target 
as DC charging companies.
