Dynamic Loading & Fatigue Life
Dynamic Loading & Fatigue Life
Dynamic loading of disc springs occurs when the load continuously changes from preload to final load.
The “stress-time” curve of such disc springs which pulsate uniformly is sinusoidal. This is not true in cases of impact loading,
and therefore it is difficult to predict their life and behaviour.
Disc spring “life” may be differentiated into 2 categories:
1) Limited life: where cycles vary without failure between
40,000 and 2,000,000 cycles.
2) Unlimited life: cycles in excess of 2.106 without failure. For
virtually indefinite life, the table below indicates the appropriate values required, given in percent of travel, relating
preload to final load AND considering the disc spring

Fatigue Life
Fatigue life for disc springs is defined by the effective number of
stress cycles that can be sustained prior to failure under certain
conditions. This depends on the minimum stress, maximum
stress, and stress range.
The diagrams presented here are for evaluating fatigue life of
single disc springs or series stacks not more than 6 springs. There
are three basic groups, depending on thickness (see legend
under each diagram).
The horizontal axis represents PRELOAD STRESS.
The vertical axis represents FINAL STRESS.
The fatigue life is found at the intersection of these points on the
graph. The ZONE in which they fall tells the predicted life. If they
fall outside the zones, their life is not generally predictable.
The horizontal border line enclosing the top portion of the graph
(zone) represents the yield strength of the spring steel material.
Intersection points of min/max stress limits which fall outside the
graph/zone boundaries are to be avoided as they indicate spring
failure is likely at an early stage.
The graphs were developed based on empirical test data. The
test loads were sinusoidally executed.
How to Use the Graphs
1. For standard catalog disc springs:
a) Determine preload stress.
b) Determine final load stress.
The intersection of the stress coordinates will indicate the range
of fatigue life that may be expected.
2. For non-standard or special disc springs:
a) Determine the preload stress for points S2 and S3. Use
the HIGHER of the two values for preload and final load.
b) Repeat above procedure for FINAL STRESS, using again
the higher value found.
