 100101. Promotion and regulation 

(a)  IN GENERAL.The  Secretary,  acting  through  the  Director 
of  the  National  Park  Service,  shall  promote  and  regulate  the  use 
of the National Park System by means and measures that conform 
to  the  fundamental  purpose  of  the  System  units,  which  purpose 
is  to  conserve  the  scenery,  natural  and  historic  objects,  and  wild 
life  in  the  System  units  and  to  provide  for  the  enjoyment  of  the 
scenery,  natural  and  historic  objects,  and  wild  life  in  such  manner 
and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment 
of future generations. 

(b) DECLARATIONS. 

(1) 1970 DECLARATIONS.Congress declares that 

(A)  the  National  Park  System,  which  began  with 
establishment  of  Yellowstone  National  Park  in  1872,  has 
since  grown  to  include  superlative  natural,  historic,  and 
recreation areas in every major region of the United States 
and its territories and possessions; 

(B)  these  areas,  though  distinct  in  character,  are  united 
through their interrelated purposes and resources into one 
National Park System as cumulative expressions of a single 
national heritage; 

(C)  individually  and  collectively,  these  areas  derive 
increased  national  dignity  and  recognition  of  their  superb 
environmental  quality  through  their  inclusion  jointly  with 
each  other  in  one  System  preserved  and  managed  for  the 
benefit  and  inspiration  of  all  the  people  of  the  United 
States; and 

(D)  it  is  the  purpose  of  this  division  to  include  all  these 
areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable 
to the System. 

(2)  1978  REAFFIRMATION.Congress  reaffirms,  declares,  and 
directs that the promotion and regulation of the various System 
units  shall  be  consistent  with  and  founded  in  the  purpose 
established  by  subsection  (a),  to  the  common  benefit  of  all 
the people of the United States. The authorization of activities 
shall  be  construed  and  the  protection,  management,  and 
administration  of  the  System  units  shall  be  conducted  in  light 
of  the  high  public  value  and  integrity  of  the  System  and  shall 
not  be  exercised  in  derogation  of  the  values  and  purposes 
for  which  the  System  units  have  been  established,  except  as 
directly and specifically provided by Congress.

System unit for purposes of scientific study. 

(b)  CRITERIA.A  request  for  use  of  a  System  unit  under  sub-
section  (a)  may  be  approved  only  if  the  Secretary  determines  that 
the proposed study 

(1)  is  consistent  with  applicable  laws  and  Service  manage-

ment policies; and 

(2)  will  be  conducted  in  a  manner  that  poses  no  threat  to 
the  System  unit  resources  or  public  enjoyment  derived  from 
System unit resources. 

(c)  FEE WAIVER.The  Secretary  may  waive  any  System  unit 
admission  or  recreational  use  fee  in  order  to  facilitate  the  conduct

decisions 

The  Secretary  shall  take  such  measures  as  are  necessary  to 
ensure  the  full  and  proper  utilization  of  the  results  of  scientific 
study for System unit management decisions. In each case in which 
an action undertaken by the Service may cause a significant adverse 
effect  on  a  System  unit  resource,  the  administrative  record  shall 
reflect  the  manner  in  which  System  unit  resource  studies  have 
been  considered.  The  trend  in  the  condition  of  resources  of  the 
System  shall  be  a  significant  factor  in  the  annual  performance 
evaluation of each superintendent of a System unit. 
 100707. Confidentiality of information 

Information  concerning  the  nature  and  specific  location  of  a 
System  resource  that  is  endangered,  threatened,  rare,  or  commer-
cially valuable, of mineral or paleontological objects within System 
units,  or  of  objects  of  cultural  patrimony  within  System  units, 
may  be  withheld  from  the  public  in  response  to  a  request  under 
section 552 of title 5 unless the Secretary determines that 

(1)  disclosure  of  the  information  would  further  the  purposes 
of  the  System  unit  in  which  the  resource  or  object  is  located 
and  would  not  create  an  unreasonable  risk  of  harm,  theft, 
or  destruction  of  the  resource  or  object,  including  individual 
organic or inorganic specimens; and 

(2)  disclosure  is  consistent  with  other  laws  protecting  the

Subchapter IIIMining Activity Within 

System Units 

 100731. Findings and declaration 

Congress finds and declares that 

(1) the level of technology of mineral exploration and develop-
ment  has  changed  radically,  and  continued  application  of  the 
mining  laws  of  the  United  States  to  System  units  to  which 
the  mining  laws  apply  conflicts  with  the  purposes  for  which 
the System units were established; and 

(2) all mining operations in System units should be conducted 
so  as  to  prevent  or  minimize  damage  to  the  environment  and 
other resource values. 

 100732. Preservation  and  management  of  System  units  by 

Secretary; promulgation of regulations 

To  preserve  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future  generations 
the  pristine  beauty  of  System  units,  and  to  further  the  purposes 
of section 100101(a), chapter 1003, and sections 100751(a), 100752, 
100753,  and  102101  of  this  title  and  the  individual  organic  Acts 
for  the  System  units,  all  activities  resulting  from  the  exercise  of 
mineral  rights  on  patented  or  unpatented  mining  claims  within 
any  System  unit  shall  be  subject  to  such  regulations  prescribed 
by  the  Secretary  as  the  Secretary  considers  necessary  or  desirable 
for the preservation and management of the System units. 

 100733. Recordation of mining claims; publication of notice 
All  mining  claims  under  the  Mining  Law  of  1872  (30  U.S.C. 
chapter  2,  sections  161  and  162,  and  chapters  12A  and  16)  that 
lie within the boundaries of System units in existence on September 
28,  1976,  that  were  not  recorded  with  the  Secretary  within  one 
year  after  September  28,  1976,  shall  be  conclusively  presumed 
to be abandoned and shall be void. The recordation does not render 
valid  any  claim  that  was  not  valid  on  September  28,  1976,  or 
that becomes invalid after that date. 

 100734. Report on finding or notification of potential dam-

age to natural and historical landmarks 

When  the  Secretary  finds  on  the  Secretarys  own  motion  or  on 
being  notified  in  writing  by  an  appropriate  scientific,  historical, 
or  archeological  authority  that  a  district,  site,  building,  structure, 
or  object  that  has  been  found  to  be  nationally  significant  in  illus-
trating  natural  history  or  the  history  of  the  United  States  and 
that  has  been  designated  as  a  natural  or  historic  landmark  may 
be  irreparably  lost  or  destroyed  in  whole  or  in  part  by  any  surface 
mining  activity,  including  exploration  for  or  removal  or  production 
of  minerals  or  materials,  the  Secretary  shall  notify  the  person 
conducting  the  activity  and  submit  a  report  on  the  findings  or 
notification,  including  the  basis  for  the  Secretarys  finding  that 
the activity may cause irreparable loss or destruction of a national 
landmark,  to  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation,  with 
a  request  for  advice  of  the  Council  as  to  alternative  measures 
that  may  be  taken  by  the  United  States  to  mitigate  or  abate 
the activity.

ment,  Death  Valley  National  Monument,  Organ  Pipe  Cactus 
National  Monument,  or  Mount  McKinley  National  Park  to  sell

and  values  requires  that  public  accommodations,  facilities,  and 
services that have to be provided within those System units should

(1)  visitation  will  not  unduly  impair  those  resources  and 

values; and 

(2)  development  of  public  accommodations,  facilities,  and 
services  within  System  units  can  best  be  limited  to  locations 
that  are  consistent  to  the  highest  practicable  degree  with  the 
preservation  and  conservation  of  the  resources  and  values  of 
the System units. 

(b)  DECLARATION OF POLICY.It  is  the  policy  of  Congress  that 
the  development  of  public  accommodations,  facilities,  and  services 
in  System  units  shall  be  limited  to  accommodations,  facilities,  and 
services that 

(1)  are  necessary  and  appropriate  for  public  use  and  enjoy-

ment of the System unit in which they are located; and 

(2)  are  consistent  to  the  highest  practicable  degree  with  the 
preservation  and  conservation  of  the  resources  and  values  of 
the System unit. 

 101913. Award of concession contracts 

In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section 101912 
of this title, and except as provided by this subchapter or otherwise 
authorized  by  law,  the  Secretary  shall  utilize  concession  contracts

modations,  facilities,  and  services  to  visitors  to  System  units.

(b)  LEASEHOLD SURRENDER INTEREST IN CAPITAL IMPROVE-
MENTS.A  concessioner  that  constructs  a  capital  improvement  on 
land  owned  by  the  United  States  within  a  System  unit  pursuant 
to  a  concession  contract  shall  have  a  leasehold  surrender  interest 
in  the  capital  improvement  subject  to  the  following  terms  and 
conditions: 

(1)  IN GENERAL.A  concessioner  shall  have  a  leasehold  sur-
render  interest  in  each  capital  improvement  constructed  by 
a  concessioner  under  a  concession  contract,  consisting  solely 
of  a  right  to  compensation  for  the  capital  improvement  to 
the extent of the value of the concessioners leasehold surrender 
interest in the capital improvement. 

(2) PLEDGE AS SECURITY.A leasehold surrender interest may 
be  pledged  as  security  for  financing  of  a  capital  improvement 
or  the  acquisition  of  a  concession  contract  when  approved  by 
the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter. 

(3)  TRANSFER

128 STAT. 3144 

PUBLIC LAW 113287DEC. 19, 2014 

(A) HOW VALUE IS DETERMINED.The Secretary may pro-
vide,  in  any  new  concession  contract  that  the  Secretary 
estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more 
than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender 
interest in a capital improvement shall be based on 

(i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, 
over  the  same  number  of  years  as  the  time  period 
associated  with  the  straight  line  depreciation  of  the 
initial  value  (construction  cost  of  the  capital  improve-
ment),  as  provided  by  applicable  Federal  income  tax 
laws  and  regulations  in  effect  on  November  12,  1998; 
or 

(ii)  an  alternative  formula  that  is  consistent  with 

the objectives of this subchapter. 

(B)  WHEN ALTERNATIVE FORMULA MAY BE USED.The 
Secretary  may  use  an  alternative  formula  under  subpara-
graph (A)(ii) only if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny 
of  the  financial  and  other  circumstances  involved  in  the 
particular  concession  contract  (including  providing  notice 
in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that 
the  alternative  formula  is,  compared  to  the  standard 
method  of  determining  value  provided  for  in  paragraph 
(5),  necessary  to  provide  a  fair  return  to  the  Federal 
Government and to foster competition for the new contract 
by  providing  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  make  a  profit 
under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received 
in  response  to  a  solicitation  that  includes  the  alternative 
formula,  the  concession  opportunity  shall  be  resolicited 
with  the  leasehold  surrender  interest  value  as  described 
in paragraph (5). 

(7)  INCREASE IN VALUE OF INTEREST.Where  a  concessioner, 
pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital 
improvement  to  an  existing  capital  improvement  in  which  the 
concessioner  has  a  leasehold  surrender  interest,  the  cost  of 
the additional capital improvement shall be added to the then- 
current value of the concessioners leasehold surrender interest. 
(c)  SPECIAL RULE FOR POSSESSORY INTEREST EXISTING BEFORE 

NOVEMBER 13, 1998. 

(1)  IN GENERAL.A  concessioner  that  has  obtained  a 
possessory  interest  (as  defined  pursuant  to  the  Act  of  October 
9, 1965 (known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy 
Act; Public Law 89249, 79 Stat. 969), as in effect on November 
12,  1998)  under  the  terms  of  a  concession  contract  entered 
into  before  November  13,  1998,  shall,  on  the  expiration  or 
termination  of  the  concession  contract,  be  entitled  to  receive 
compensation  for  the  possessory  interest  improvements  in  the 
amount  and  manner  as  described  by  the  concession  contract. 
Where that possessory interest is not described in the existing 
concession  contract,  compensation  of  possessory  interest  shall 
be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  laws  in  effect  on 
November 12, 1998. 

(2)  EXISTING CONCESSIONER AWARDED A NEW CONTRACT. 
A  concessioner  awarded  a  new  concession  contract  to  replace 
an  existing  concession  contract  after  November  13,  1998, 
instead  of  directly  receiving  the  possessory  interest  compensa-
tion,  shall  have  a  leasehold  surrender  interest  in  its  existing 
possessory  interest  improvements  under  the  terms  of  the  new

concession  contract  and  shall  carry  over  as  the  initial  value 
of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) 
an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest 
as  of  the  termination  date  of  the  previous  concession  contract. 
In  the  event  of  a  dispute  between  the  concessioner  and  the 
Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter 
shall be resolved through binding arbitration. 

(3)  NEW CONCESSIONER AWARDED A CONTRACT.A  new 
concessioner  awarded  a  concession  contract  and  required  to 
pay  a  prior  concessioner  for  possessory  interest  in  prior 
improvements  shall  have  a  leasehold  surrender  interest  in  the 
prior  improvements.  The  initial  value  in  the  leasehold  sur-
render interest (instead of construction cost) shall be an amount 
equal  to  the  value  of  the  existing  possessory  interest  as  of 
the termination date of the previous concession contract. 

(4)  DE NOVO REVIEW OF VALUE DETERMINATION.If  the  Sec-
retary,  or  either  party  to  a  value  determination  proceeding 
conducted  under  a  Service  concession  contract  issued  before 
November  13,  1998,  considers  that  the  value  determination 
decision  issued  pursuant  to  the  proceeding  misinterprets  or 
misapplies  relevant  contractual  requirements  or  their  under-
lying  legal  authority,  the  Secretary  or  either  party  may  seek, 
within  180  days  after  the  date  of  the  decision,  de  novo  review 
of the value determination decision by the United States Court 
of  Federal  Claims.  The  Court  of  Federal  Claims  may  make 
an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the deter-
mination decision. 

(d)  TRANSITION TO SUCCESSOR CONCESSIONER.On  expiration  or 
termination  of  a  concession  contract  entered  into  after  November 
13,  1998,  a  concessioner  shall  be  entitled  under  the  terms  of  the 
concession contract to receive from the United States or a successor 
concessioner  the  value  of  any  leasehold  surrender  interest  in  a 
capital improvement as of the date of the expiration or termination. 
A  successor  concessioner  shall  have  a  leasehold  surrender  interest 
in  the  capital  improvement  under  the  terms  of  a  new  concession 
contract  and  the  initial  value  of  the  leasehold  surrender  interest 
in  the  capital  improvement  (instead  of  construction  cost)  shall  be 
the  amount  of  money  the  new  concessioner  is  required  to  pay 
the  prior  concessioner  for  its  leasehold  surrender  interest  under 
the terms of the prior concession contract. 

(e)  TITLE TO IMPROVEMENTS.Title  to  any  capital  improvement 
constructed  by  a  concessioner  on  land  owned  by  the  United  States 
in a System unit shall be vested in the United States. 

 101916. Reasonableness of rates and charges 

(a)  IN GENERAL.A  concession  contract  shall  permit  the  conces-
sioner  to  set  reasonable  and  appropriate  rates  and  charges  for 
facilities,  goods,  and  services  provided  to  the  public,  subject  to 
approval under subsection (b). 

(b) APPROVAL BY SECRETARY REQUIRED. 

(1)  FACTORS TO CONSIDER.A  concessioners  rates  and 
charges  to  the  public  shall  be  subject  to  approval  by  the  Sec-
retary.  The  approval  process  utilized  by  the  Secretary  shall 
be  as  prompt  and  as  unburdensome  to  the  concessioner  as 
possible and shall rely on market forces to establish reasonable-
ness  of  rates  and  charges  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.

128 STAT. 3146 

PUBLIC LAW 113287DEC. 19, 2014 

The  Secretary  shall  approve  rates  and  charges  that  the  Sec-
retary  determines  to  be  reasonable  and  appropriate.  Unless 
otherwise  provided  in  the  concession  contract,  the  reasonable-
ness  and  appropriateness  of  rates  and  charges  shall  be  deter-
mined  primarily  by  comparison  with  those  rates  and  charges 
for facilities, goods, and services of comparable character under 
similar  conditions,  with  due  consideration  to  the  following  fac-
tors and other factors deemed relevant by the Secretary: 

(A) Length of season. 
(B) Peakloads. 
(C) Average percentage of occupancy. 
(D) Accessibility. 
(E) Availability and costs of labor and materials. 
(F) Type of patronage. 

(2)  RATES AND CHARGES NOT TO EXCEED MARKET RATES AND 
CHARGES.Rates and charges may not exceed the market rates 
and charges for comparable facilities, goods, and services, after 
taking  into  account  the  factors  referred  to  in  paragraph  (1). 
(c)  IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS.Not  later  than  6 
months  after  receiving  recommendations  from  the  Advisory  Board 
regarding  concessioner  rates  and  charges  to  the  public,  the  Sec-
retary shall implement the recommendations or report to Congress 
the reasons for not implementing the recommendations. 
 101917. Franchise fees 

(a) IN GENERAL.A concession contract shall provide for payment 
to  the  Federal  Government  of  a  franchise  fee  or  other  monetary 
consideration  as  determined  by  the  Secretary,  on  consideration 
of  the  probable  value  to  the  concessioner  of  the  privileges  granted 
by  the  particular  contract  involved.  Probable  value  shall  be  based 
on  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  net  profit  in  relation  to  capital 
invested  and  the  obligations  of  the  concession  contract.  Consider-
ation  of  revenue  to  the  United  States  shall  be  subordinate  to  the 
objectives  of  protecting  and  preserving  System  units  and  of  pro-
viding necessary and appropriate services for visitors at reasonable 
rates. 

(b)  PROVISIONS TO BE SPECIFIED IN CONTRACT.The  amount 
of  the  franchise  fee  or  other  monetary  consideration  paid  to  the 
United  States  for  the  term  of  the  concession  contract  shall  be 
specified  in  the  concession  contract  and  may  be  modified  only  to 
reflect  extraordinary  unanticipated  changes  from  the  conditions 
anticipated  as  of  the  effective  date  of  the  concession  contract.  The 
Secretary shall include in concession contracts with a term of more 
than 5 years a provision that allows reconsideration of the franchise 
fee  at  the  request  of  the  Secretary  or  the  concessioner  in  the 
event  of  extraordinary  unanticipated  changes.  The  provision  shall 
provide  for  binding  arbitration  in  the  event  that  the  Secretary 
and  the  concessioner  are  unable  to  agree  on  an  adjustment  to 
the franchise fee in those circumstances. 
(c) SPECIAL ACCOUNT IN TREASURY. 

(1) DEPOSIT AND AVAILABILITY.All franchise fees (and other 
monetary  consideration)  paid  to  the  United  States  pursuant 
to  concession  contracts  shall  be  deposited  in  a  special  account 
established in the Treasury. Twenty percent of the funds depos-
ited  in  the  special  account  shall  be  available  for  expenditure 
by  the  Secretary,  without  further  appropriation,  to  support 
activities throughout the System regardless of the System unit

the special account shall remain available until expended. 

(2)  SUBACCOUNT FOR EACH SYSTEM UNIT.There  shall  be 
established  within  the  special  account  a  subaccount  for  each 
System unit. Each subaccount shall be credited with 80 percent 
of  the  franchise  fees  (and  other  monetary  consideration)  col-
lected  at  a  single  System  unit  under  concession  contracts.  The 
funds  credited  to  the  subaccount  for  a  System  unit  shall  be 
available  for  expenditure  by  the  Secretary,  without  further 
appropriation,  for  use  at  the  System  unit  for  visitor  services 
and  for  purposes  of  funding  high-priority  and  urgently  nec-
essary  resource  management  programs  and  operations.  The 
funds  credited  to  a  subaccount  shall  remain  available  until

leasehold surrender interests

surrender interest may be transferred, assigned, sold, or otherwise 
conveyed or pledged by a concessioner without prior written notifica-
tion to, and approval by, the Secretary. 

(b)  CONDITIONS.The  Secretary  shall  approve  a  transfer  or 
conveyance  described  in  subsection  (a)  unless  the  Secretary  finds 
that 

(1)  the  individual,  corporation,  or  other  entity  seeking  to 
acquire  a  concession  contract  is  not  qualified  or  able  to  satisfy 
the terms and conditions of the concession contract; 

(2) the transfer or conveyance would have an adverse impact 

on 

(A)  the  protection,  conservation,  or  preservation  of  the 

resources of the System unit; or 

(B)  the  provision  of  necessary  and  appropriate  facilities 
and  services  to  visitors  at  reasonable  rates  and  charges; 
and 

(3) the terms of the transfer or conveyance are likely, directly 

or indirectly, to 

(A) reduce the concessioners opportunity for a reasonable 
profit  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  concession  contract; 
(B)  adversely  affect  the  quality  of  facilities  and  services 

provided by the concessioner; or 

(C)  result  in  a  need  for  increased  rates  and  charges 
to  the  public  to  maintain  the  quality  of  the  facilities  and 
services. 

(c) MODIFICATION OR RENEGOTIATION OF TERMS.The terms and 
conditions  of  any  concession  contract  under  this  section  shall  not 
be subject to modification or open to renegotiation by the Secretary 
because  of  a  transfer  or  conveyance  described  in  subsection  (a)

 104906. Protection of right of individuals to bear arms 

(a) FINDINGS.Congress finds the following: 

(1)  The  2d  amendment  to  the  Constitution  provides  that 
the  right  of  the  people  to  keep  and  bear  Arms,  shall  not 
be infringed. 

(2)  Section  2.4(a)(1)  of  title  36,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations, 
provides  that  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  section 
and  parts  7  (special  regulations)  and  13  (Alaska  regulations), 
the  following  are  prohibited:  (i)  Possessing  a  weapon,  trap 
or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, 
trap or net. 

(3)  The  regulations  described  in  paragraph  (2)  prevent 
individuals  complying  with  Federal  and  State  laws  from  exer-
cising  the  2d  amendment  rights  of  the  individuals  while  at 
System units. 

(4)  The  existence  of  different  laws  relating  to  the  transpor-
tation  and  possession  of  firearms  at  different  System  units 
entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at System units. 

(5) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations 
relating  to  the  2d  amendment  rights  of  law-abiding  citizens 
in  System  units  that  went  into  effect  on  January  9,  2009 
(A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court 
for  the  District  of  Columbia  granted  a  preliminary  injunc-
tion  with  respect  to  the  implementation  and  enforcement 
of the new regulations; and

override  the  2d  amendment  rights  of  law-abiding  citizens  on 
83,600,000 acres of System land. 

(7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment 
rights of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.

remaining  share  of  the  cost  shall  be  borne  by  the  State  in  a 
manner  and  with  funds  or  services  as  shall  be  satisfactory  to 
the Secretary. 

(d) COMPREHENSIVE STATE PLAN.

ANCE.A  comprehensive  statewide  outdoor  recreation  plan

No  plan  shall  be  approved  unless  the  chief  executive  official 
of the State certifies that ample opportunity for public participa-
tion  in  plan  development  and  revision  has  been  accorded.  The

plan  (other  than  land,  water,  or  an  interest  in  land  or 
water  acquired  from  the  United  States  for  less  than  fair 
market  value),  but  not  including  incidental  costs  relating 
to acquisition. 

(B) RETENTION OF RIGHT OF USE AND OCCUPANCY.When 
a State provides that the owner of a single-family residence 
may,  at  the  owners  option,  elect  to  retain  a  right  of  use 
and  occupancy  for  not  less  than  6  months  after  the  date 
of  acquisition  of  the  residence  and  the  owner  elects  to 
retain such a right 

(i)  the  owner  shall  be  deemed  to  have  waived  any 
benefits  under  sections  203  to  206  of  the  Uniform 
Relocation  Assistance  and  Real  Property  Acquisition 
Policies  Act  of  1970  (42  U.S.C.  4623  to  4626);  and 
(ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall 
not  be  deemed  to  be  a  displaced  person  as  defined 
in section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601). 

(3)  DEVELOPMENT OF BASIC OUTDOOR RECREATION FACILI-
TIES.Under  paragraph  (1),  the  Secretary  may  provide  finan-
cial  assistance  for  a  project  for  development  of  basic  outdoor 
recreation  facilities  to  serve  the  general  public,  including  the 
development  of  Federal  land  under  lease  to  States  for  terms 
of  25  years  or  more.  No  assistance  shall  be  available  under 
this  chapter  to  enclose  or  shelter  a  facility  normally  used  for 
an  outdoor  recreation  activity,  but  the  Secretary  may  permit 
local  funding,  not  to  exceed  10  percent  of  the  total  amount 
allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for construction 
of  a  sheltered  facility  for  a  swimming  pool  or  ice  skating  rink 
in an area where the Secretary determines that the construction 
is  justified  by  the  severity  of  climatic  conditions  and  the 
increased public use made possible by the construction. 

(1)  CRITERIA FOR MAKING PAYMENTS.The  Secretary  may 
make  a  payment  to  a  State  only  for  a  planning,  acquisition, 
or  development  project  that  is  approved  by  the  Secretary.  The 
Secretary  shall  not  make  a  payment  for  or  on  account  of  any 
project  with  respect  to  which  financial  assistance  has  been 
given or promised under any other Federal program or activity, 
and  no  financial  assistance  shall  be  given  under  any  other 
Federal  program  or  activity  for  or  on  account  of  any  project 
with respect to which the assistance has been given or promised 
under  this  chapter.  The  Secretary  may  make  payments  from 
time  to  time  in  keeping  with  the  rate  of  progress  toward  the 
satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of all projects 
and  all  payments,  or  any  commitments  relating  thereto,  shall 
be  withheld  until  the  Secretary  receives  appropriate  written 
assurance  from  the  State  that  the  State  has  the  ability  and 
intention  to  finance  its  share  of  the  cost  of  all  of  the  projects, 
and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State 
expense,  the  properties  or  facilities  acquired  or  developed  for 
public outdoor recreation use. 

(2)  PAYMENT RECIPIENTS.Payments  for  all  projects  shall 
be  made  by  the  Secretary  to  the  chief  executive  official  of 
the  State  or  to  a  State  official  or  agency  designated  by  the

this  section  shall,  without  the  approval  of  the  Secretary,  be 
converted  to  other  than  public  outdoor  recreation  use.  The 
Secretary shall approve a conversion only if the Secretary finds 
it  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  then-existing  comprehensive 
statewide  outdoor  recreation  plan  and  only  on  such  conditions 
as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the substitution 
of  other  recreation  properties  of  at  least  equal  fair  market 
value  and  of  reasonably  equivalent  usefulness  and  location. 
Wetland  areas  and  interests  therein  as  identified  in  the  wet-
lands  provisions  of  the  comprehensive  plan  and  proposed  to 
be  acquired  as  suitable  replacement  property  within  the  same 
State  that  is  otherwise  acceptable  to  the  Secretary,  acting 
through  the  Director,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  of  reasonably 
equivalent  usefulness  with  the  property  proposed  for  conver-
sion. 

(4)  REPORTS AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES.No  payment 
shall  be  made  to  any  State  until  the  State  has  agreed  to 
(A)  provide  such  reports  to  the  Secretary  in  such  form 
and  containing  such  information  as  may  be  reasonably 
necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretarys 
duties under this chapter; and 

(B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting proce-
dures  as  may  be  necessary  to  ensure  proper  disbursement 
and  accounting  for  Federal  funds  paid  to  the  State  under 
this chapter. 

(g)  RECORDS.A  recipient  of  assistance  under  this  chapter  shall 
keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records 
that fully disclose 

(1)  the  amount  and  the  disposition  by  the  recipient  of  the 

proceeds of the assistance; 

(2)  the  total  cost  of  the  project  or  undertaking  in  connection 

with which the assistance is given or used; and 

(3)  the  amount  and  nature  of  that  portion  of  the  cost  of 
the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such 
other records as will facilitate an effective audit.

General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have 
access  for  the  purpose  of  audit  and  examination  to  any  records

this chapter. 

(i)  PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION.With  respect  to  property 
acquired or developed with assistance from the Fund, discrimination 
on the basis of residence, including preferential reservation or mem-
bership systems, is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable 
differences  in  admission  and  other  fees  may  be  maintained  on 
the basis of residence. 

(j)  COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES.To  ensure  consist-
ency  in  policies  and  actions  under  this  chapter  with  other  related 
Federal  programs  and  activities  and  to  ensure  coordination  of  the 
planning,  acquisition,  and  development  assistance  to  States  under 
this  section  with  other  related  Federal  programs  and  activities 
(1)  the  President  may  issue  such  regulations  with  respect

under  subsection  (b)  may  not  be  more  than  15  percent  of  the 
total amount of funds appropriated under this chapter for rehabilita-

(a)  MATCHING GRANTS.The  Secretary  may  provide  70  percent 
matching  rehabilitation  grants  and  innovation  grants  directly  to 
eligible  general  purpose  local  governments  on  the  Secretarys 
approval of applications for the grants by the chief executive officials 
of those governments. 

(b)  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.An  innovation  grant  should  be 
closely  tied  to  goals,  priorities,  and  implementation  strategies 
expressed  in  local  park  and  recreation  recovery  action  programs, 
with particular regard to the special considerations listed in section 
200504(c)(2) of this title. 

(c) TRANSFER.If consistent with an approved application, a grant 
recipient  may  transfer  a  rehabilitation  grant  or  innovation  grant 
in whole or in part to an independent special purpose local govern-
ment, private nonprofit agency, or county or regional park authority 
if  the  assisted  recreation  area  or  facility  owned  or  managed  by 
the  transferree  offers  recreation  opportunities  to  the  general  popu-
lation  within  the  jurisdictional  boundaries  of  the  grant  recipient. 
(d) PAYMENTS.Payments may be made only for a rehabilitation 
project  or  innovation  project  that  has  been  approved  by  the  Sec-
retary.  Payments  may  be  made  from  time  to  time  in  keeping  with

project,  except  that  the  Secretary,  when  appropriate,  may  make 
advance payments on an approved rehabilitation project or innova-
tion  project  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed  20  percent  of  the  total 
project cost. 

(e)  MODIFICATION OF PROJECT.The  Secretary  may  authorize 
modification  of  an  approved  project  only  when  a  grant  recipient 
adequately demonstrates that the modification is necessary because 
of  circumstances  not  foreseeable  at  the  time  at  which  the  project 
was proposed.

evidence  of  their  commitments  to  ongoing  planning,  rehabilitation, 
service,  operation,  and  maintenance  programs  for  their  park  and

park  and  recreation  recovery  action  programs  that  maximize 
coordination  of  all  community  resources,  including  other  federally 
supported  urban  development  and  recreation  programs.  During  an 
initial  interim  period  to  be  established  by  regulations  under  this 
chapter,  this  requirement  may  be  satisfied  by  local  government

gram  to  overall  community  development  and  urban  revitaliza-
tion efforts.

cies. 

(f)  MATCHING RECOVERY ACTION PROGRAM GRANTS.The  Sec-

128 STAT. 3263 

(d) PUBLIC LAW 11124.Section 512 of Public Law 11124 (123 

Stat. 1764) is amended to read as follows: 

16 USC 1a7b. 

SEC. 512. PROTECTION OF RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO 

BEAR ARMS 

(a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.Congress finds the following: 

(1)  The  2d  amendment  to  the  Constitution  provides  that 
the  right  of  the  people  to  keep  and  bear  Arms,  shall  not 
be infringed. 

(2)  Section  27.42  of  title  50,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations, 
provides  that,  except  in  special  circumstances,  citizens  of  the 
United  States  may  not  possess,  use,  or  transport  firearms 
on  national  wildlife  refuges  of  the  United  States  Fish  and 
Wildlife Service. 

(3)  The  regulations  described  in  paragraph  (2)  prevent 
individuals  complying  with  Federal  and  State  laws  from  exer-
cising  the  2d  amendment  rights  of  the  individuals  while  at 
units of the National Wildlife Refuge System. 

(4)  The  existence  of  different  laws  relating  to  the  transpor-
tation  and  possession  of  firearms  at  different  units  of  the 
National  Wildlife  Refuge  System  entrapped  law-abiding  gun 
owners  while  at  units  of  the  National  Wildlife  Refuge  System. 
(5) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations 
relating  to  the  2d  amendment  rights  of  law-abiding  citizens 
in  units  of  the  National  Wildlife  Refuge  System  that  went 
into effect on January 9, 2009 

(A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court 
for  the  District  of  Columbia  granted  a  preliminary  injunc-
tion  with  respect  to  the  implementation  and  enforcement 
of the new regulations; and 

(B) the new regulations 

(i)  are  under  review  by  the  Obama  administration; 

and 

(ii) may be altered. 

(6)  Congress  needs  to  weigh  in  on  the  new  regulations  to 
ensure  that  unelected  bureaucrats  and  judges  cannot  again 
override  the  2d  amendment  rights  of  law-abiding  citizens  on 
90,790,000  acres  of  land  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service. 

(7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment 
rights of an individual at a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge 
System should not be infringed. 

(b)  PROTECTION OF RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO BEAR ARMS IN 
UNITS OF THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM.The Secretary 
shall  not  promulgate  or  enforce  any  regulation  that  prohibits  an 
individual  from  possessing  a  firearm,  including  an  assembled  or 
functional  firearm,  in  any  unit  of  the  National  Wildlife  Refuge 
System if 

(1)  the  individual  is  not  otherwise  prohibited  by  law  from 

possessing the firearm; and 

(2)  the  possession  of  the  firearm  is  in  compliance  with  the 
law  of  the  State  in  which  the  unit  of  the  National  Wildlife 
Refuge System is located..

a  provision  of  law  that  is  replaced  by  a  title  54  provision. 
(2) TITLE 54 PROVISION.The term title 54 provision means 
a  provision  of  title  54,  United  States  Code,  that  is  enacted

(b)  CUTOFF DATE.The  title  54  provisions  replace  certain  provi-
sions  of  law  enacted  on  or  before  January  15,  2013.  If  a  law

law  is  deemed  to  amend  or  repeal,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  cor-
responding  title  54  provision.  If  a  law  enacted  after  that  date 
is  otherwise  inconsistent  with  a  title  54  provision  or  a  provision 
of  this  Act,  that  law  supersedes  the  title  54  provision  or  provision 
of this Act to the extent of the inconsistency. 

(c)  ORIGINAL DATE OF ENACTMENT UNCHANGED.For  purposes 
of  determining  whether  one  provision  of  law  supersedes  another 
based  on  enactment  later  in  time,  a  title  54  provision  is  deemed 
to have been enacted on the date of enactment of the source provi-
sion that the title 54 provision replaces. 

(d)  REFERENCES TO TITLE 54  PROVISIONS.A  reference  to  a  title 
54  provision  is  deemed  to  refer  to  the  corresponding  source  provi-
sion. 

(e) REFERENCES TO SOURCE PROVISIONS.A reference to a source 
provision,  including  a  reference  in  a  regulation,  order,  or  other 
law,  is  deemed  to  refer  to  the  corresponding  title  54  provision. 
(f)  REGULATIONS,  ORDERS,  AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE 
ACTIONS.A  regulation,  order,  or  other  administrative  action  in 
effect  under  a  source  provision  continues  in  effect  under  the  cor-
responding title 54 provision. 

(g) ACTIONS TAKEN AND OFFENSES COMMITTED.An action taken 
or  an  offense  committed  under  a  source  provision  is  deemed  to 
have  been  taken  or  committed  under  the  corresponding  title  54 
provision.
