Wildlife in tropical forests is a main source of livelihoods, and the ‘empty forest syndrome’ can have direct
negative impacts on the health and well-being of forest
dependent communities. The bushmeat crisis therefore
reminds us of humankind’s dependence on biodiversity:
the disappearance of wildlife from our forests is also a serious threat to the cultural and spiritual identity of many
indigenous and local communities and other forest dependent communities.

Addressing the bushmeat crisis will be an important step towards the 2010 target to significantly reduce the
loss of biodiversity, as well as to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This Technical Series publication synthesizes existing knowledge on this topic, and suggests some policy options to make the
use of wild fauna more sustainably. Interactions with other sectors, in particular forestry, agriculture, and
fisheries, are demonstrated.
We are grateful to our partner organizations, in particular the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and
the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), for their contributions to this report. We hope that it will provide
impulses for a coordinated and response to the increasingly urgent challenge of addressing the bushmeat
crisis – at international, national, and local level.

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

1. Introduction

1.2. Definitions

1.1. Focus of the paper

Bushmeat is defined in this paper as any non-domesticated terrestrial mammals, birds, reptiles and
amphibians harvested for food. Insects, crustaceans,
grubs, molluscs and fish are excluded from this definition and will not be addressed in depth. While invertebrates can be locally important dietary items, it
is the larger vertebrates which constitute the majority of the terrestrial wild animal biomass consumed
by humans. However the links between bushmeat,
fish and invertebrate harvesting will be explored.

This document addresses the hunting of tropical forest wildlife for food (known as “bushmeat”, “wildmeat”, and/or “game meat”; see 1.2 for the definition).
It was prepared for the Secretariat of the Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) under the coordination of CIFOR and in collaboration with the Liaison
Group on Non-timber Forest Resources, convened
in response to paragraph 42 of decision VI/22 of the
Conference of the Parties to the CBD and its annex,
the expanded programme of work on forest biological diversity, on the basis of goal 4, objective 2, activity (a) of programme element 11 .
Hunting for food in tropical forests is an issue of
concern for primarily three reasons:
•
There is strong evidence illustrating that the
scale of hunting, occurring in these regions, poses a
real threat to many tropical forest species;
•
The depletion of wildlife is intimately linked
to the food security and livelihood of numerous
tropical forest-region inhabitants as many of these
forest-dwelling or forest-dependent people have few
alternative sources of protein and income;
•
The so-called “bushmeat crisis” is the focus
of many conservation organizations and of a number of development programmes throughout the
tropics. However many of the ways in which hunting
and wildlife trade operate, as well as their links to
livelihood or ecosystem function, are either poorly
understood or not properly taken into account.

Hunting is defined as the extraction of any wildlife,
from the wild, by whatever means and for whatever
purpose. Wildlife is hunted for food, trophies (most
often skins, teeth, antlers and horns), medicines
and other traditional uses (most hard and soft body
parts), and as pets (especially primates, birds and
reptiles). Therefore individuals hunt tropical forest
wildlife primarily to eat and/or sell it.
Garden hunting2 (or farm-bush hunting) occurs
when wild animals enter swiddens3 and fallows because of the relative abundance of food sources. As a
result several game species thrive in this habitat mosaic of swiddens and forest (Linares 1976; Peterson
1981; Posey 1985). These animals are usually viewed
as pests by farmers and are generally hunted. In the
idealized scenario, crop losses resulting from the
presence of these species are balanced with protein
gains.
Commercial wildlife trade is characterized by the
transport and sale of wildlife in a manner which
often requires capital investment, generally operates over long distances (greater than a hunter
would walk in a day), and involves middlemen
or re-sellers who are not hunters themselves.

1 Establish a liaison group with an associated workshop to facilitate development of a joint work plan with relevant members of the
Collaborative Partnership on Forests to bring harvesting of non-timber forest products (NTFP)s, with a particular focus on bushmeat,
to sustainable levels. This group should have a proportionate regional representation, giving special consideration to regions where
bushmeat is a major issue and representation of relevant organizations such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The mandate of this group is to:
i.	
Consult in a participatory manner with key stakeholders to identify and prioritize major issues pertaining the unsustainable
harvesting of non-timber forest products, particularly of bushmeat and related products;
ii.	 Provide advice on the development of policies, enabling legislation and strategies that promote sustainable use of, and trade
in, non-timber forest products, particularly bushmeat and related products;
iii.	 Provide advice on appropriate alternative sustainable livelihood technologies and practices for the affected communities;
iv.	 Provide advice on appropriate monitoring tools.
2 Garden hunting is based on the tendency of many game animals to be attracted to garden sites where they are killed by humans. In

some cases they are attracted to crop plants, in others to the weeds that flourish under increased light in open areas (see also www.fao.
org/docrep/v7795e/V7795e02.htm).
3 Swiddens are (usually small) areas of shifting cultivation, often using “slash and burn” techniques, referring to the temporary cutting
and burning of forests or woodlands to create fields for agriculture or pasture for livstock, or for a variety of other purposes.

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

However a significant proportion of game meat is
also sold locally amongst villagers.
Article 2 of the Convention on Biological Diversity
defines sustainable use as: The use of components of
biological diversity in a way and at a rate that does
not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity, thereby maintaining its potential to meet the needs
and aspirations of present and future generations.
In practical terms, a sustainable use is one which is
perpetuated over the long term. Often local interest
in the resource is an important factor in maintaining its quality. Obviously as one cannot sustainably
use a resource that has vanished, the statement that
sustainable use is a form of conservation has some
merit. It should be clear that all uses, consumptive
or non-consumptive, will impact on ecology in some
way and that these impacts will translate into more
or less dramatic effects on the local environment
depending on what is used and how. Ultimately, for
hunting to be sustainable, it must be so from social,
ecological and economic viewpoints.

demands. Anthropogenic disturbances of wildlife
(from industrial to local hunting activities) as well
as policy decisions should be managed in a way that
sustains or increase these benefits.
In all the above it is essential:
•
To note that in each case (ecological, economic or social sustainability), the optimal population density may be different;
•
To consider the time factor. As no one can
be sure that a particular use will be sustained indefinitely, there can only ever be a probability of a use
being sustainable. These probabilities are based on
current knowledge and commitments or on a qualification of the estimated sustainability by its estimated duration;
•
With the availability of different data sets
and models and the great uncertainty of their validity, the precautionary principle has to be taken into
account in developing policies based on the current
imperfect knowledge.

Ecological sustainability: Populations of animal species usually fluctuate naturally over time, depending
on many environmental factors. However habitat
quality and predation (including hunting) are two of
the most important factors in determining population densities. The combination of increased hunting pressure and the loss of habitat quality triggered
the decline of many wildlife species, especially larger
species with specific habitat requirements and low
reproduction rates. Sustainable harvests should not
be greater than production, and harvested populations should not be reduced to densities whereby
they can no longer fulfil their ecological role, e.g. as
pollinators, seed dispersers, predators and browsers.
However, in practice, it can be very difficult to properly assess population densities and annual production, especially in closed forest ecosystems. Similarly
establishing the specific ecological role of all species
is an equally difficult task. One should therefore be
cautious about assuming ecological roles as our understanding of this complex web of interactions is far
from exhaustive (see discussion in section 2).
Economic sustainability: Harvested populations
should not be reduced to densities whereby they
cease to fulfil their economic role of ensuring sustained livelihoods for dependent populations.
Social sustainability: The benefits of wildlife for local communities are wide-ranging and diverse. They
play an important role in addressing many social

Text Box 1. Lessons learned from North America
Management of hunting in tropical forests is a recent phenomenon, with most active programs only being
initiated in the past 50 years or considerably less. In North America, the ecology and productivity of the
ecosystems are totally different to those of tropical forests, but none the less some lessons can be learned
from North America’s long history of wildlife management.
The first humans to enter the Americas about 11,000 years ago were the Clovis peoples. Evidence indicated that their hunting for food probably caused the extinction of many large vertebrate species.
As a reaction against regulations in Europe which restricted hunting for the benefit of the ruling classes,
during the initial European colonization of North America, wildlife was deemed to belong to the people.
For almost 200 years, the freedom to hunt, including for commercial sale, was largely unregulated. The
effect on local wildlife populations was obvious. In the early 1600s in Massachusetts, USA, it only took ten
years for the local deer population to be depleted by colonist hunters. The American bison once roamed
in the millions throughout the western United States, but uncontrolled hunting drove it to the edge of
extinction in the mid-1800s. Over a 60 year period, herds estimated to number around 60 million were
reduced to a mere 25 animals.
In the mid- to late-19th century, commercial hunters on the Chesapeake bay used sink boxes (shallow
draft barges) and punt guns to slaughter huge numbers of Canada geese, canvasback ducks, redhead ducks
and other water fowl, that were shipped on the railroads to markets in eastern cities. One shot fired from
these 50 kg cannons could kill up to 30 ducks and 10 geese at once, generating the equivalent of an average
worker’s monthly salary for the hunter.
By the turn of the nineteenth century, over-hunting combined with the destruction of the eastern hardwood and old growth forests meant that the future for wildlife in North America was bleak. Perhaps
never before in human history had so many animals of so many species been killed in such a short time.
Species extinctions within the United States included: Stellar’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) (1768) ; Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) (1878); Eastern subspecies of elk (Cervus canadensis canadensis) (1880); sea mink (Mustela macrodon) (1894); Merriam’s elk (Cervus canadensis merriami) (1906);
Audubon’s bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis auduboni) (1910); Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis
carolinensis) (1914 in the wild; 1918 in captivity); and heath hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido) (1932).
Perhaps the most infamous of the North American extinctions around this time was the passenger pigeon.
Although it was the most abundant bird that had ever existed, its numbers went from five billion to zero
in 70 years. It was extinct in the wild by 1900 and in captivity by 1914. Nest trees were cut and the young
collected. Live birds were tied to stools to attract and allow the slaughter of huge flocks of birds seeking to
roost – this was the origin of the term stool-pigeon. In 1869, 21 million birds were shipped out of Hartford, Michigan in only 40 days.
The realization that America’s once magnificent wildlife was disappearing rapidly led to some major legislative changes. In 1896, the Connecticut State Court prevented one citizen from shipping game birds out
of the State; this was a fundamental turning point declaring that wildlife belonged not only to individuals,
but to society as a whole. This was followed in 1900 by President William McKinley signing the first federal wildlife conservation law, the Lacey Act. This was a sweeping piece of legislation that made it illegal to
transport birds across state boundaries if they had been taken in violation of any other law in the nation.
Today, after numerous amendments, the Lacey Act makes it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell,
buy, or possess fish, wildlife, or plants taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any federal,
state, foreign, or Native American tribal law, treaty, or regulation.

2. The ecological importance
of wildlife
Human extractive activities in tropical forests (including but not restricted to hunting) are disruptive
processes and can trigger numerous, yet not completely understood, mechanisms (compensatory or
predation rate changes) or effects (trophic cascade or
keystone effects) which will in turn alter, in a more
or less significant way, the overall function, structure and composition of the ecosystem. Although
every organism contributes to ecosystem processes,
the nature and magnitude of individual species contributions vary considerably. Most ecosystem processes are driven by the combined activities of many
species. Plant regeneration (loss of pollinators, seed
dispersers and seed predators), food webs (loss of
top predators or of their prey), and plant diversity
(change in herbivory patterns, increased pests) are
amongst the various processes dependent upon the
presence of fauna. Therefore activities, such as hunting, have the potential to not only impact targeted
species but the ecosystem more broadly.

•
Top predators (e.g. large cats): their extirpation triggers an uncontrolled growth of the prey
population which in turn dramatically increases
browsing or grazing intensity to the point where
forest regeneration can be totally prevented. However, it is also possible that the loss of a predator will
be compensated by hunting pressure in which case
changes might not be as dramatic as expected.
•
Elephants have a tremendous role in modifying vegetation structure and composition through
their feeding habits (differential herbivory, seed dispersal) and movements in the forest (killing a large
number of small trees). Two similar forests, one with
elephants the other without, show different succession and regeneration patterns as shown by the long
term studies in Budongo (no elephants) and Rabongo (large population of elephants) forests (Sheil &
Salim, 2004).

However some species or functional groups matter
more than others. This becomes especially clear in
the case of “keystone species” which are also referred
to as “ecosystem engineers” or organisms with high
“community importance values.” All these terms
refer to species whose loss has a disproportionate
impact on the community when compared to the
loss of other species. Conventional wisdom therefore predicts that as hunters prefer large animals that
are often keystone species, the reduction or extirpation of these animals will result in dramatic changes
to the ecosystems (See Text Box 3 and 4). Some of
these predicted changes have been empirically demonstrated while others have yet to be demonstrated
or have so far proved to be inexact (see Bennett &
Robinson 2000 for a review and Wright 2003 for a
thorough discussion on this issue). Some examples
of keystone species whose removal induced change
in ecosystem features are:

Different species, performing similar roles in ecosystem processes and having similar trophic status
or life-history constitute what have been termed
functional groups. Species within these groups such
as grazing mammals, large predators, perennial
grasses, or nitrogen-fixing microbes are functionally
similar despite their uniqueness in genes, life history,
and other traits. It is therefore often difficult to determine the relative contributions of a given species
to ecosystem processes as several species may contribute in similar ways.

•
Wild pigs (Sus spp., Potamochoerus sp, etc.)
and some antelopes are among the most active seed
predators. A significant change in their population
densities will have a major effect on seedling survival
and forest regeneration.
On the other hand, there are some examples where
additions or losses of possible keystone species have
had, for various reasons, little obvious effect on
ecosystem processes, e.g. when another species takes
over the ecological niche of a keystone species.

Text Box 2. Examples of successful programs to reduce hunting to more
sustainable levels
Programs to manage wildlife trade can be instituted at one or more points along the axis from source
populations (in protected areas, logging concessions, community forests or other lands), through to the
point of sale and consumption (in subsistence hunter communities, to local markets, to long-distance and
even overseas markets).
The best way to maintain source populations varies greatly between sites, depending on the legal status
and ecological conditions, the distribution, size, socioeconomics and cultures of local human populations
and the wider socioeconomic and political context in which the site is embedded. Under different conditions, some programmes have succeeded in reducing hunting by protecting source populations through
management programmes mediated by government authorities, logging companies or local communities.
Often international or local NGOs are involved in providing technical advice for such programs.
Controlling hunting in a national park
Nagarahole National Park in south-west India covers 644 km2, and is home to many species of spectacular
large mammals, including tigers, elephant, gaur, dhole, sambar and axis deer. It is accessible by road on
many sides, and is surrounded by extremely high human population densities: over 100,000 people live
within 10 km of its boundaries. Hence, potential hunting pressure is extremely high for direct consumption
and local trade, and for commercial products (e.g., tiger bones, ivory). A multi-faceted program led by the
Indian Government involves intensive protection of the area by a large, legally-empowered forest service.
About 250 government staff are engaged in the Park, equivalent to one person per 2.6 km2. Management
comprises intensive enforcement (with wildlife population densities being highest where enforcement
efforts are most focused), local education programmes, voluntary resettlement of enclaved communities,
and a detailed ongoing monitoring programme. As a result, over the last 30 years the National Park has
become one of the best places for viewing wildlife in tropical Asia, with guarantees of spectacular views of
large mammals, even in the midst of such pressure.
Wildlife management in a community reserve
By contrast, the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo in the Peruvian Amazon comprises some 3,225
km2. The diversity of mammals in the reserve is greater than in any other protected area in the Amazon,
and possibly globally, e.g., at least 14 species of primates occur here. Local human population density is
extremely low; only nine villages consider themselves close enough to the reserve to be involved in management.
The closest city, Iquitos, has 300,000 residents but is more than 100 km away, with no road access linking
the two. Management of the reserve legally lies with the local communities. Hunting pressure is limited to
local subsistence consumption, some sales of dried meat to Iquitos, and peccary pelts for sale to overseas
markets. There is almost no hunting within the reserve by outsiders. Wildlife management involves a
combination of community-based and co-management strategies, involving local communities, government agencies, NGO extension workers and researchers. Decisions on resource use and management are
voted upon during community meetings, and are informed by NGO extension workers, based on detailed
research and monitoring by researchers. This allows communities to experiment with different types of
management, and to find management systems which are compatible with their culture. Communities
are not too large for effective communication, and can easily define their boundaries and membership.
The area is divided into strictly protected and buffer zones. Data shows that harvests of all species except
tapir are apparently sustainable, and ways are being sought to ensure that tapir hunting is also reduced to
sustainable levels. Hence, different ecological and socio-economic conditions mean that an entirely different system of management from that used in Nagarahole is ensuring that wildlife populations are being
conserved successfully.

Private sector co-management of hunting
In most tropical forests, logging concessions are important sources of hunted animals, with logging being
correlated with rapidly escalating and unsustainable levels of hunting. In logging concessions surrounding
Nouabalé Ndoki National Park, northern Republic of Congo, a successful collaboration has been established between the Government, an NGO (Wildlife Conservation Society, WCS), the private sector (Congolaise Industrielle des Bois, CIB), and local communities. The aim of the project is to design, implement,
and monitor wildlife management systems with the timber company and local communities, in the forestry concessions adjacent to the National Park. The project components include: conservation education
for logging company managers, employees and their families, and local communities; wildlife regulations
in company policy; a strict system of wildlife law enforcement carried out by locally recruited and highly
trained ecoguards; development of alternative protein supplies and activities including fish farms and the
importing of affordable beef; and an intensive program of socio-economic and ecological monitoring. The
presence of abundant populations of large mammals throughout the concession, including gorillas, chimpanzees, forest elephants and bongo, is testimony to the success of the project. The private sector benefits
from the increased vigilance and law enforcement through a decrease in theft of company property in the
concession, improved corporate image, and improved opportunities for timber certification. The local
communities benefit because the management programme supports their traditional land tenure system.
They also have employment opportunities as jobs in the project are targeted specifically at local communities, and they have increased food and cultural security. Wildlife conservation benefits by a reduction in
threats facing the National Park, by some of the management costs being borne by the private sector, and
by wildlife being protected outside the Park over an extremely large area. A mutually beneficial system of
management is therefore created.
Regulating demand for wild meat
One programme that has been successful at the demand end of the spectrum has been implemented by
the Malaysian state of Sarawak. In this region wildlife populations had been severely depleted in the past
50 years due in large part to hunting. For example, the banteng and Sumatran rhinoceros had become
extinct; hornbills had become rare due to hunting for their feathers and meat; the ranges and numbers of
both proboscis monkeys and orangutans had shrunk dramatically.
Many rural people still depended on hunting for their subsistence, so the Government, with technical support from WCS, prepared and implemented a wildlife master plan. This comprehensive policy document
covered all steps needed by all sectors to conserve wildlife in the State, and balancing this with development needs. A core focus was reducing hunting to sustainable levels, while still allowing rural people to
hunt for their own subsistence. This resulted in passing of the Wild Life Protection Ordinance in 1998,
which banned all commercial sales of wildlife taken from the wild. This meant that rural people who still
needed to hunt for their food could do so, but the unsustainable commercial trade in wildlife would be
stopped. It was widely supported by rural community leaders as it protected their own resources from being lost to outside hunters and to external trade.
The Ordinance was put into effect by the Government through major publicity and education programmes
in towns and rural areas. In towns, government workers explained the law to traders and consumers – focusing on the reasons why the law was needed, and the penalties for breaking the law. In rural areas, the
programme explained the benefits of maintaining wildlife populations in the forest so that they can provide a continuing food supply for future generations. The law was also vigorously enforced in markets, art
and craft shops, pet shops and restaurants throughout the State. Further measures included controlling
firearms and ammunition, and implementing regulations to ensure that logging roads are not used for
hunting and transporting wild meat from forests to towns. These combined measures increasingly limited
hunting only to those who depend on it for subsistence, thereby reducing it to more sustainable levels, and
conserving the wildlife resource both for its own sake, and also for the people who depend on it.

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

For almost 20 years after kangaroo rats were experimentally removed from a Chihuahuan desert
ecosystem in the United States, other rodent species
were unable to compensate and use the available
resources. This changed abruptly in 1995, when an
alien species of pocket mouse colonized the ecosystem, used most of the available resources, and compensated almost completely for the missing kangaroo rats (Morgan Ernest & Brown 2001).
The answer to the question “What are the environmental, social and economic implications of sustainable use?” in this context is largely dependent on
what one means by “sustainability”. If sustainability
means ensuring that the ecological system can provide only a limited number of benefits in the long
term, then in many cases this can be achieved despite eradicating a specific species. If it means that
the full range of environmental benefits are to be

maintained, the level of use should be adapted to allow for this continued level of environmental services. However, this does not mean that the status quo
of wildlife resources should be kept in all its aspects,
e.g. that no change to the age or size structure, sex
ratio, distribution or abundance should occur. If it
means regulating the impacts of a use, such that the
ecosystem can continue to produce the target species, then dramatic impacts can occur, perhaps to
the benefit of the target population, but not necessarily to other ecosystem components or their users
(Webb 1994). Environmental sustainability however
is not necessarily restricted to ensuring continuity of
certain ecosystem functions. Avoiding irreversible
loss of biodiversity, and related cultural and future or
present economic losses, however should be a critical part of the equation.

Text Box 3. The impact of hunting on the biological community
Hunters focus initially on large animals, and continue to hunt them even when their numbers become
low (Text Box 4). Such species comprise the majority of the mammalian biomass in undisturbed forests,
and play keystone ecological roles. Reduction or loss of such species will have wider impacts on the forest community, through:
•	
Loss of pollinators. Large fruit bats in particular are extremely important pollinators of many
tropical forest trees;
•	
Loss of seed predators (e.g., pigs, peccaries, agoutis, large squirrels). With reduced seed predation, trees with large seeds are at a competitive advantage over trees with smaller seeds. In one study in
Panama, such trees dominated forest patches after less than 75 years following the depletion of seed-eating animals;
•	
Loss of seed dispersers (e.g., primates, frugivorous bats, frugivorous birds, forest ungulates).
Many large animals play a primary role in seed dispersal; seeds of up to 75% of plant species in African
rain forests are dispersed by animals. Hunting can deplete complete guilds of seed dispersers by removing primates, large birds and bats. The exact balance between animal dispersed plants and vegetative
propagation of rain forest plants is still unknown, but the loss of seed dispersers will undoubtedly affect
forest composition, in ways that are difficult to predict;
•	
Loss of predators (e.g., large cats, raptors). This can cause unusual and uneven densities of different prey species. In turn, proliferation of certain prey species can lead to declines or local extinctions
of their animal or plant food species, which changes forest composition and decreases overall biodiversity. In Barro Colorado Island, Panama, the absence of large predators led to an increase in mesopredators (coatis). The increased predation by the meso-predators on birds’ eggs and fledglings caused
declines and local extinctions of many low-nesting birds;
•	
Loss of food for predators. Hunting of ungulates and primates can reduce the populations of
predators that depend on them for prey. In India, hunting can result in reductions of 90% of the prey
eaten by tigers. This reduces tiger densities, and also results in their hunting smaller prey, thereby causing further detrimental effects on the biological community.
The loss of animals from forest ecosystems and the resultant disruption of ecological and ultimately
evolutionary processes, changes in species composition and probable reduction in biological diversity
are collectively known as the “empty forest syndrome”.

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

3. Wildlife and sustainable livelihoods
3.1. The values of wildlife
The use of wildlife has important livelihood aspects
and serves multiple roles. Wildlife products are often major items of consumption or display and have
high medicinal and spiritual values in many human
cultures (Scoones et al., 1992). Bushmeat, in particular, offers a number of benefits to forest-dwelling populations. It is an easily traded resource as it
is transportable, has a high value/weight ratio and
is easily preserved at low cost. It often represents
both the primary source of animal protein and the
main cash-earning commodity for the inhabitants of
the humid forest regions of the tropics. Throughout
tropical forest countries, many people benefit from
wild meat: from those who eat it as part of a forestdependent subsistence life-style, to those who trade
and transport it at all points along different supply
chains, to those who consume it in restaurants and
homes, often far from the forest.
3.1.1. Economic values
Rural people, moving from a subsistence lifestyle to
a cash economy, have relatively few options for generating income. They can sell agricultural or pastoral
produce, work for a cash wage in agriculture or industry, or sell retail goods in local or regional marketplaces. However for rural people, without access
to capital, land or livestock, the harvest of wildlife
resources may offer the best return for labour input.
Cash income from the sale of wildlife products can
be highly variable, even when the same resource category is considered. While those products destined
for international markets fetch much higher prices
(a breeding pair of Lear’s Macaw is worth around
$100,000 on the black market; Panda pelts sell for
$10,000 on the black market in Hong Kong and
dealers and collectors in Asia pay $40,000 for panda
skins4 ) than locally consumed goods and the unit
value of wild meat is low, the returns from hunting
are generally higher than average local wages (Gally
et Jeanmart 1996, Ntiamoa-Baidu 1997, Bennett &
Robinson 2000, etc.).
Since the 1950s, a growing demand from urban areas
combined with larger populations more generally
has catalyzed the trade in wildlife resources, with
resources increasingly being drawn from forested

areas (including agriculture/ secondary forest mosaics) into towns and cities as favoured or inexpensive
sources of animal protein. From first harvest to final
sale, the trade in bushmeat for local, national or regional trade now forms an important part of the informal sector’s “hidden economy” and although access to markets is a key factor in realizing economic
values of wild products, the determination of people
to access markets if there is sufficient economic incentive to do so should not be underestimated (Neumann and Hirsch, 2000). If prices and profits are
high enough, local traders will make remarkable use
of any transport networks to get perishable goods to
market. As a result hunting and the bushmeat trade,
although largely ignored in official trade and national statistics, play a crucial role in the economies of
numerous tropical forested countries, but they are
usually not tapped as a source of government revenues.
An inventory in 1995-96 of the four main markets
in the Cameroon capital, Yaoundé, indicates sales of
70–90 tons of bushmeat monthly (Bahuchet & Ioveva 1999). A similar situation exists in Gabon where
the overall annual bushmeat trade has been valued
at about $25 million (Wilson & Wilson quoted in
Colchester 1994: 48-9). Estimates of the national
value of the bushmeat trade range from US$42-205
million across countries in West and Central Africa
(Davies 2002). Similar examples can be found in
the tropical forests of South America. For example
in Tahuayo (Peru), 22 tons of wild meat is extracted
annually from a 500 km2 area, with 86% of it being
sold for more than US$ 17,000 (Bodmer et al. 1994).
For the whole of the Amazon basin, the value of wild
meat harvested exceeds US$ 175 million per year
(TCA 1995).
For many tropical forest peoples, the distinction between subsistence and commercial use is blurred,
with meat from the forest supplementing both diets
and incomes. Several studies group self-consumption and local sales under the category of “locally
consumed” (table 1). Recent studies (Takforyan
2001, De Mérode et al. 2003) show that most people
in tropical forests hunt and that meat sales within
the village can be significant (30% in Cameroon, up
to 90% in the Democratic Republic of Congo) somewhat contradicting the conventional wisdom that
banning external market sales of bushmeat, and restricting consumption to local subsistence use, offers
a ‘win-win’ strategy to the benefit of both conservation and the poor (De Mérode et al. 2003).

3.1.2. Nutritional values

Bushmeat represents an important protein source in
the tropics while gathered plant foods are important
dietary supplements to the starchy staple diet. In
at least 62 countries world-wide, wildlife and fish
constitute a minimum of 20% of the animal protein
in rural diets. Wildlife provides significant calories
to rural communities, as well as essential protein and
fats (for a comprehensive review of the importance
and role of wildlife in nutrition see Hladik et al. 1989,
1996 and Froment et al. 1996). Even where there has
been a change from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to
pastoralism or agriculture, hunting and gathering
remain important to a high proportion of rural
households in tropical forests. Hunting provides
between 30 to 80% of the overall protein intake of
rural households in Central Africa (Koppert et al.
1996) and nearly 100% of animal proteins. What is
known of the nutritional composition of bushmeat
species suggests that these provide an equivalent or
even greater quality of food than domestic meats with
less fat and more protein. The average protein value
of wild meat is estimated at around 30g of protein per
100g of meat (Ntiamoa-Baidu 1997). These proteins
cannot be substituted by available protein of vegetal
origin, such as cassava or gnetum leaves, as they are
poorer in amino-acids (Pagezy 1996). They could be
replaced by other vegetal sources, dairy products,

Bushmeat stew
and/or meat from domesticated animals (cf. also
chapters 6 and 7.2.2.1).
Though some recent studies (De Mérode et al. 2003)
show that wild meat does not necessarily play a major
role in the nutrition of poor forest households, they
also demonstrate clearly that it plays an important
food security role during the lean season. A study
(Fa et al. 2002) shows that if bushmeat harvests were
reduced to a sustainable level, all Central African
countries except Gabon would be dramatically
affected by the loss of wild protein supply. The

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

dependence on bushmeat protein is emphasized by
the fact that four out of the five countries studied do
not produce sufficient quantities of non-bushmeat
protein to feed their populations. These findings
imply that a significant number of forest mammals
could become extinct relatively soon, and that protein
malnutrition is likely to increase dramatically if food
security in the region is not promptly resolved.
A precise evaluation of the quantity of wild meat
consumed per capita is not easy to derive from the
published information for various practical and
methodological reasons. It is clear however that
consumption depends of the type and residence of
consumers (table 2), with hunter-gatherers eating
100 to 400 g of meat daily, while rural (farmers,
logging company employees) and urban populations
consume 40 to 160 g and 3 to 94 g, respectively.
It is not known how the diet of people might change
as a result of extinctions and diminishing wildlife
resources. It might lead to shifting practices, relying
more on domesticated animals supplemented with
products from garden farming. It is possible that
people are able to substitute to a large extent the
protein that is provided by bushmeat, once the
resource becomes less available and, therefore more
expensive, but this would have to be studied and
documented.
3.1.3. Social and cultural values
Wildlife and hunting are intimately linked to many
cultures throughout the world’s tropical forests even
if in some cases the meat is only of minor nutritional
importance. Important social and cultural values are
linked to foods and medicines derived from wild
resources. Therefore while hunting provides meat
and income it also remains an important social and
cultural tradition for many peoples (both in developed
and in developing countries). Acquisition of animal
parts as cultural artefacts, for personal adornment
or for hunting trophies is still a widespread practice
throughout tropical forest regions and the rest of the
world. In many cultures to be a hunter is essential
in gaining respect, achieving manhood or winning a
bride. As a result, peoples hunt, even when they have
alternative sources of nutrition or income (Young,
1970, Posewtz 1994, Bennet & Robinson 2000). These
links between hunting, wildlife, religion, mythology,
and sociology of forest-dwelling peoples have to be
considered in conjunction with sound conservation
and management plans (Bradley 2002).
In several cases, meat sharing among members of
the community does not seem to play a large role

16

Penan with Blowpipe – Sarawak, Borneo
(less than 20% of the game in African cases) in meat
distribution within the community (Dounias 1999,
Takforyan 2001, De Mérode et al. 2003). Rather, sale
within the village or the community appears as a new
market, creating monetary networks of exchange
between villagers. Such a sale could well represent
a new social obligation, as it did in the past with the
sharing or gifting of wild meat. The trend is therefore
of an increased commercialization of bushmeat with
all the associated consequences (see section 5.4)
3.2. Impacts on livelihoods
Conventional wisdom tells us that the people
who, in theory, will suffer the most from declining
wildlife resources are the millions of people across
Latin America, Africa and Asia living in and from
the forests. These people (hunter-gatherers, swidden
cultivators, urban poor) are often the poorest and
most marginalized people in their country. They
typically lack the education and skills to easily find
alternative employment. They lack capital or access to
agricultural markets and cannot switch to alternative
livelihoods or food sources.
Many of the assumptions which have been made
about the role of bushmeat in local livelihoods are
not borne out by research however. Evidence is
growing (Takforyan, 2001, de Mérode et al. 2003)
and is beginning to show that the poor are likely to
be more dependent than the rich on sales of meat

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

as they cannot afford to withhold the meat from
consumption because it is a high value and tradable
commodity, as discussed elsewhere. This contradicts
the conventional view that the poor primarily have
subsistence needs, while the wealthy trade wild
meat.
In reality, many people do not depend on wildlife
resources as a full-time source of food or income, but
as a buffer to see them through times of hardship (e.g.
unemployment, illness of relatives, crop failure), or to
gain additional income for special needs (e.g. school
fees, festivals, funerals). The fact that few individuals
solely or primarily depend on wildlife resources for
their main income (and these are rarely the poorest)
should not be taken to indicate that the prohibition
of meat sales would not seriously affect them. Rural
livelihoods are often made up of complex mosaics
of enterprise, and components which may appear
minor may none the less be integral to family welfare,
and an important dimension of risk reduction and
social safety nets.
Increased trade in wildlife products is clearly a serious
sustainability issue that also has very important
livelihood implications. There is the need to separate
out the commercial interests of entrepreneurs seeking
to make money from what they know to be an illicit
activity with high commercial value (i.e. trade in
medicinal products like rhinoceros horns, pangolin
scales or tiger bones) to the day-to-day means of
survival of poor populations (i.e. the great majority
of the bushmeat trade in Central Africa). De Mérode
et al. (2003) show that wild meat and wild fish form a
moderately important component of household diets
but a very important component of household sales,
particularly for the poor. More generally wildlife
sales are often the main source of income for poor
and marginalised populations. Lack of sustainability,
increased controls or blanket criminalization of the
trade is likely to seriously impact the livelihood of
these poorest of the poor.

Studies show that the number of commercial wildlife
trade middlemen and re-sellers is small compared to
the number of hunters. Traders generally buy and sell
wildlife because it is profitable at the time. Yet, they
also usually sell other goods on the same or other
occasions, so few depend on selling wildlife as their
sole source of income. There is also evidence that
the vertical integration of the bushmeat trade has
important gender aspects, and provides important
benefits to women and children, often from activities
requiring widely available skills and offering low
financial risk (e.g. cooked meal sales).

4. The bushmeat crisis
Wildlife species are and have been harvested almost
everywhere, from the deepest seas to the highest
mountains, and from both marine and freshwater
systems. Numerous species, from invertebrates, fish,
and amphibians to reptiles, birds and mammals, have
and are continuing to be used to enhance human
welfare. However this wildlife harvest has not been
without impact. Historically hunting pressure has
contributed to the extinction and near-extinction of
several animal species, especially where species were
exploited for either food, medicine or ornamental
purposes (e.g. passenger pigeon, right whales, great
auk, Eskimo curlew, red kite, European wolf). Several
studies illustrate the potential impact that wildlife
harvesting may have on a species and an ecosystem
more broadly. For example:
•
Historical records (Murray 2003) tell us that
numerous species are extinct or have been locally extirpated at least partly because of unregulated hunting, often in synergy with habitat alteration (tertiary
mammal megafauna, pacific islands large fauna, passenger pigeon, American bison, and North-African
elephants for example).

Text Box 4. Why large-bodied animals are prone to local extinction due to
hunting
Large animals tend to be the those that hunters favour most as killing one animal supplies a
large amount of meat, and larger animals tend to be the ones that have the most valuable horns,
antlers, tusks, furs, skins, feathers or other artefacts. Thus, the value returned per unit of time
and cost expended by hunters is greatest for large animals. Large species are rare compared to
smaller ones and reproduce slowly; thus, they are especially vulnerable to overhunting and have
limited capacity to recover from population declines. Primates breed more slowly than their
size alone would suggest, so they are vulnerable to hunting in ways which are more like those
of much larger animals.
17

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

The harvest of wildlife need not necessarily be as
severe as the above examples indicate, as situations
exist where the hunting of preferred species was
strictly regulated (e.g. deer, Cervus elaphus, and
beaver, Castor canadensis), and where viable
populations survived despite intense land use
changes. One has to be careful however with these
examples, as most do not deal with tropical forest
ecosystem which are far more complex and in
many cases more sensitive than temperate forests
and tropical savannas. Looking at some of the most
commonly hunted species in African tropical forests,
such as duikers (Cephalophus spp.), it appears that the
situation may not be as dire as sometimes assumed:
•
In a report from IUCN (Eves & Ruggiero
2002), it was estimated that the number of all duikers, blue duikers (C. monticola) and bay duikers (C.
dorsalis) are 13.24, 7.00 and 0.73 million respectively. The same document estimates the harvest rates
of blue and bay duikers at 18 and 0.25 million respectively, based on the assumption that 50% of the
forest area is hunted and by using the latest estimates
of dense forest areas in Central Africa (Mayaux et
al. 2004). At such harvest intensities, these species
should presently be extinct, yet the rate of offtake remains more or less unabated.

•
Most studies show that large game species
are the first to disappear, leaving behind only the
most resilient, small or unhunted species. For example in Kilum Ijim, Cameroon, many species of
large mammals, including elephants, gorillas and
other primate species, have become locally extinct in
the past 50 years due to hunting and land use change
(Maisels et al. 2001). In the Tangkoko Duasudara
Nature Reserve in Sulawesi, Indonesia, between 1978
and 1993, the population of crested black macaques
declined by 75%, while anoa and maleo bird populations declined by 90%, and bear cuscus numbers fell
by 95% (O’Brien and Kinnaird 2000). Similar situations have been reported inside national parks of
northern Thailand (Doi Inthanon and Doi Suthep),
where all elephants, wild cattle and tigers have been
hunted out. Similarly in Viet Nam, 12 species of large
vertebrates are either extinct or on their way to extinction as a result of hunting, demographic pressure
and land use changes. These extinct species include
Eld’s deer, wild water buffalo, batagur turtle and Siamese crocodile, while the tiger, elephant and banteng
are close to extinction (Bennett & Rao 2002).

Orphan Gorilla
•
Between 1925 and 1950 up to 800,000
duikers pelts were annually exported from French
Equatorial Africa. Yet the areas from which these
animals were extracted (e.g. the Lobaye province
in Central African Republic) are still rather heavily
hunted and remain a source of the same duikers
species (Fargeot 2003).
The example of duikers would therefore suggest that
the outlook is not necessarily as bleak as sometimes
reported, and a differentiated approach is needed for
different cases and species. However it is obvious
that an overall lack of sustainability and a resource
depletion problem exist in many regions. This
situation is often aggravated by changes in land use,
for example opening up of forest areas for mining
or logging. The empirical evidence supporting this
statement is both voluminous and varied (see Text
Box 5 and 6).

5. This term describes the local extinction of the most vulnerable species due to unsustainable hunting pressure, often immediately
following changes in land-use.

Estimated sustainability: % of species unsustainably hunted (number of species studied); Yes /No when the above
information was not available in the reference

4.1. Bushmeat crisis, the empirical evidence
A review of the literature addressing the sustainability
of hunting in tropical forests was compiled by
comparing estimated productivity and off-take rates.
From table 3 it can be seen, that in general hunting
appears to be unsustainable.
•
The percentage of unsustainably hunted
species is greater than 50% in a limited number of
cases for which the number of species studied is low
(6 at the maximum)
•
It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions
or recommendations as to the overall sustainability
(or not) of a use when 40% of the species are overharvested. These species might well be locally extirpated or reduced to levels where they do not appear
anymore in trade but the overall use (i.e. hunting or
harvesting) can still keep going and the ecosystem
can still function. In such cases, there is clearly a
conservation problem for the over-harvested spe-

cies and action is needed but one cannot draw any
simple conclusion about the overall sustainability of
the activity and issue a blanket interdiction.
•
Most of the cases considered sustainable are either in very remote locations, sparsely
populated or beyond the influence of any external
markets (for example the Aché in Paraguay, who
live largely outside a market economy, exclude others from their hunting areas and occur at extremely
low densities – Hill & Padwe 2000). Contrarily
locations with ‘mature’ markets can also be sustainable as they generally have gone through “extinction
filters”5. For example the Takoradi market in Ghana
shows that large urban centres can be sustainably
supplied in bushmeat by robust species from an
agricultural landscape (Cowlishaw et al. 2004).
Aside from examining the relationship between
estimated productivity and offtakes, a further
method of assessing sustainability, also found in
the literature, is to monitor the population density
fluctuations of target species (table 4).

Here again, empirical studies show generally that
population densities are lower in hunted areas,
implying a potential decline in stocks and an
unsustainable use. This should be further qualified
as not all species are equal vis-à-vis hunting
pressure. Some appear very vulnerable while others
appear unaffected. However some data suggests that
a few species can be locally advantaged by hunting
practices (Bodmer et al. 1997, Cullen et al. 2000,
Salas & Kim 2002, Cowlishaw et al. 2004, HurtadoGonzales & Bodmer 2004).

Species with low intrinsic rates of population increase, long generation time and long-lived

•
Species whose mating, nesting, predator
avoidance or social behaviour allows easy harvest
are potentially more at risk. This includes groupliving species (most primates, some pigs), since
they are often noisy and travel in large groups so
several animals can be bagged at one time as well
as animals which breed communally in accessible
areas (e.g., turtles, maleo birds), or with spectacular displays and loud calls (e.g., birds of paradise,
hornbills, some primates).
•
Slow-moving species (e.g. tortoises, pango-

Papuan and soft-shell turtle
lins or bear cuscus) are easy to catch by hand once
detected and so are generally more vulnerable than
fast-moving ones (yet the tree pangolin Manis tricuspis is often also found in areas of heavy hunting
pressure).

4.2. Some methodological caveats in assessing
sustainability of hunting
While the amount of information relating to the
sustainable harvest of species is ever growing, it is far
from complete. Most tropical hunting studies have
the primary goal of determining whether hunting is
sustainable in forested areas. However many of these
studies fail to adequately address the question of what
actually constitutes sustainable hunting practices for
the following main reasons:
1.	 Many of the studies are only capable of
demonstrating a localized depletion caused by
hunting. However this is a generally expected
biological outcome whenever predator activities
are concentrated in areas smaller than the entire
catchment. The great majority of the studies
trying to assess the sustainability of hunting
have neglected the importance of the presence
or absence of game “sources” (protected or
unhunted areas) and game “sinks” (hunted
areas) in the calculation of sustainable harvest
rates. The few studies that consider sources/sinks
interactions (Novaro et al. 2000, Salas & Kim
2002) demonstrate that ignoring the presence
of sources results in an underestimation of the
sustainable harvest rate. This effect is, of course,
likely to be more pronounced for mobile species
with sizeable home ranges, who are able to move
through the landscape and re-colonize sinks
than it is for sedentary or localized species.
2.	 Spatial and temporal analyses of density data on
animals show that most populations experience
local fluctuations of density over time (e.g.
Brown et al. 2001). These temporal fluctuations
are spatially complex, consisting of moving,
localized density peaks. These fluctuations can
be caused by many different sources. Therefore
segregating abundance fluctuations into those
caused by hunting and those caused by other
factors is quite complicated. Any study that
monitors a large number of species across only
two time periods or two geographic regions will
almost always find some species that are lower
in density in one region or time-period. As
many researchers have looked at only two zones
(hunted or unhunted) or only two time periods,
recorded density fluctuations attributed to
hunting may well have their causes (or part of
it) rooted in other factors For example Hill et
al. 2003 recorded a 10% drop of encounter rates
for coatis over the 7-year period of their study
despite the fact that 1% of the stock population
was harvested each year and that coati encounter

rates in heavily hunted areas were no lower than
in unhunted areas. Therefore other factors must
be affecting the coatis’ population level. This
potential problem is further illustrated by the
current Ebola virus outbreak near the CongoleseGabonese border which is devastating gorilla
populations. We are directly witnessing this
drama but assuming that we had only two points
in the time series “before” and “after” (and had
we not known that there was such an epidemic),
we would probably have concluded that gorillas
were being decimated by poachers (Walsh et al.
2003, Leroy et al. 2004).
3.	 Sustainability estimates in many studies are
based on a formula modified by Robinson &
Redford (1991, 1994) that assumes a maximum
sustainable harvest rate determined primarily
by the density-independent rate of increase of
the studied species following a logistical curve
(Robinson 2000). Although based on a sound
theoretical basis, this model makes numerous
and often poorly founded assumptions. For
example the assumption that demographic traits
will be stable in unhunted populations may
prove to be untrue under several conditions. As
a result, populations thought to be harvested at
sustainable levels might, in fact, be under- or
over-harvested (Slade et al. 1998, Struhsaker
2001, Milner-Gulland & Resit Akçakaya 2001).
Therefore even when the annual harvest rate is
well below the calculated maximum sustainable
level the presence of many erratic and poorly
understood population processes can lead to
extirpation. Lastly many species in a bounded
ecosystem can go extinct, in relatively short
time periods, through completely natural
processes (e.g. Brown et al. 2001), a situation
that further confounds the issue of sustainable
harvest calculations.
4.	 Assessing the sustainability of hunting in
tropical forest requires biological data (rates
of population increase, densities, spatial
interaction) that are difficult to obtain and
generally unavailable for most populations.
Estimates therefore have to be considered with
caution. A good example of this fact is presented
by the biomass estimates of duikers in Central
Africa. Several studies have been conducted on
this issue and have come to substantially different
conclusions, with estimates for duiker biomass
ranging from 86 to 1497 kg/km2. While some
of these differences are partially attributable to
variations in site conditions, results obtained

21

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

from the same area but using different census
methods varied as well and are quite striking:
•
In the Ituri region (DRC), Koster & Hart
(1988) estimated a duiker biomass of 174 kg/km2
using visual counting while Wilkie & Finn (1990)
estimated 1,497 kg/km2 counting dung.
•
Cruising the same transects twice in the
hunting area of Ekom (Cameroon), Dethier (1995)
found a duiker biomass of 184 kg/km2 using simple
visual counting and of 1,326 kg/km2 using the same
method while emitting the distress call of the blue
duiker.
Similar
variations
between
census
methodologies also exist when large regions,
as opposed to specific species, are considered.
For example Robinson and Bennett (2000)
estimate the sustainable potential harvest from
the undisturbed Manu forest (Peru) at 152 kg/
km2/yr and by comparing this value to other
published harvest data, they conclude that
sustainable harvest rarely exceed 200 kg/km2/yr
and is likely to be around 150kg/km2/yr in most
tropical forests. However Fa et al. (2002) reach
rather different results and find a productivity
of 1,111 kg/km2/yr for the Congo Basin and of
488 kg/km2/yr for the Amazon Basin. Estimates
of sustainable harvest based on 150 kg/km2/yr
or on 1,100 kg/km2/yr productivity are likely
to give very different values. This demonstrates
that we do not know which estimate is the right
one. More likely they are either wrong or only
locally useable and extreme caution should be
exercised when using such estimates in quota
setting or policy decisions. From a conservation
perspective the precautionary principle should
apply and the lowest productivity should be
considered but for livelihood issues it might be
the contrary.

6.	 As demonstrated by most studies, not all
species are equally affected by hunting. Some
species are more vulnerable than others and
for the most vulnerable species hunting is
likely to be unsustainable at any given rate.
On the other hand, some species seem able to
withstand considerable of hunting pressure and
for these species hunting might be managed
sustainably provided that adequate regulation
and monitoring are in place.
7.	 Most of the market analyses of hunting do not
differentiate between game originating from
garden hunting or from commercial hunting
in undisturbed forest. Garden hunting prey are
typically the fast-reproducing species which
thrive in the forest-agriculture mosaics and that
are of little concern for conservation but of great
importance to local livelihoods. Bahuchet and
Ioveva (1999) show that brush-tailed porcupines
and cane rats would be the preferred meat of
urban residents in Yaoundé but hunters do
not sell these animals (they are generally eaten
locally) and instead sell potentially threatened
duikers (see Text Box 7). Knowing which
parts of the meat entering a market come from
garden hunting activities is another important
parameter to assess the sustainability of the use.

5.	 Much of the interest relating to conservation is
focused on animal stocks in mature and only
slightly disturbed forest ecosystems. However
in several countries much of the hunting takes
place in the more productive forest-agriculture
mosaic. Even highly disturbed agricultural or
swidden landscapes are not completely empty of
wildlife. For example 385,000 tons of bushmeat
is harvested yearly in Ghana (Ntiamoa-Baidu
1998 in Cowlishaw et al. 2004) and 118,000
tons in Côte d’Ivoire (Caspary 1999). These
farm-bush-forest mosaics are in fact inhabited
by a suite of adaptable, fast-reproducing species
able to withstand human activity (e.g., common

and blue duikers, brush-tailed porcupine, cane
and giant rat in Africa; agoutis, armadillos, red
brocket deer in the Americas). The status of such
species may not be of immediate conservation
concern, and will not attract tourists but they
have both economic and ecological value and
deserve to be taken into account in management
decisions (Naughton-Treves et al. 2003). Note
however that many of the original species
inhabiting these areas are now locally extinct.

Text Box 5. Theoretically sustainable offtake levels, and their application and
limitations when applied to management
Many models have been proposed to calculate biologically sustainable offtake rates for individual species.
Most depend in some way on calculating maximum theoretical rates of population increase for the species
concerned, and the proportion of that production which can be harvested without detrimental effects on
the population. These models are continually being refined, and are an extremely useful guide to upper
limits of offtake which are likely to be sustainable. Such limits vary greatly among tropical forest species,
with insectivores and rodents tending to have maximum sustainable offtake rates ranging from less than
20% to more than 70% of the standing population per year, to primates for which sustainable offtakes are
invariably 4% or less of the standing population per year.
Such models, when combined with monitoring of hunting offtakes and populations of hunted wildlife
species, have proved to be extremely useful tools for defining broad management strategies. They can
suggest whether current hunting pressures appear to be sustainable and can be maintained, or whether
the hunting is unsustainable and should be reduced. Some models are now refined enough to determine
precise sustainable offtake rates for particular species, if sufficient knowledge of the biology of the species
is available (e.g., population density, demography, reproductive rates, social behaviour, feeding ecology).
Applying models to active management on the ground is at present possible at very few tropical sites.
Insufficient data exist on the biology of most tropical forest species and, in addition, population densities
can vary greatly between sites due to the heterogeneity of tropical forest vegetation. Moreover, capacity
for wildlife management remains extremely low in most of the tropical forest world. Hence, the ability to
harness the power of models for species-specific adaptive management of hunting exists only for a very
few sites. Attempts to generalize from these sites to other areas are fraught with danger. For example,
sustainable hunting levels of rates for certain fast-breeding species in degraded and edge habitats might be
high. Allowing such species into commercial trade could indeed be biologically sustainable, but it might
undermine the ability to enforce the stricter regulations essential for biodiversity conservation in nearby
protected areas.
Models are invaluable in estimating whether or not present offtake rates are or are not sustainable.
They can also be extremely important in supporting political arguments for particular management
recommendations. In areas where detailed knowledge of the biology of the hunted animals is known, and
where management capacity, including for ongoing monitoring, is high, models can help set offtake rates.
Such conditions are extremely rare; in most tropical forest areas they do not exist. Thus, in areas where
maintenance of healthy wildlife populations is an agreed goal, the precautionary principle should guide
offtake levels, and monitoring is crucial to ensure that hunting is sustainable.
4.3. Factors leading to unsustainable hunting
While there are numerous factors which can lead to
the unsustainable harvest of bushmeat, they can be
grouped into one of six different categories:
1.	 Ecological factors: the number of tropical
forest animals that can be harvested
sustainably is limited in the first place
by their biological supply (production).
Hunting in tropical forests with low animal
production (e.g., monodominant forests,
upland Amazonian terra firme forests)
is less likely to be sustainable than more
productive landscapes (e.g. forest-savanna
mosaics or fruit rich forests). Although

biophysical variation between tropical
forested sites is large and more data is
needed, current best estimates suggest that
on average, they produce about 150 kg of
vertebrate biomass per year. Yet annual
hunting rates can be substantially higher
than productivity in these same forests,
with values ranging from 200 kg/km2 up to
700 kg/km2 across several locations. This
unavoidably generates declines in wildlife
populations in both the medium and long
term. Species with low intrinsic rates of
population growth are more vulnerable
to over-harvesting as are species with
particular mating, nesting, predator
avoidance strategies or social behaviour

23

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

that allows for their easy location (e.g.,
group-living species that travel in large
groups, and species that breed communally
in open areas). Lastly a decrease in forest
area, through deforestation, unsustainable
logging and land use change for examples,
contribute to a loss of habitat for typical
forest species. However the mixed
agricultural/forest landscapes that is created
through such activities usually favours a
number of other wildlife species. Some
vertebrate species that thrive in fallow
vegetation and/or agricultural mosaics are
known to be resilient to hunting pressure
and are favoured game. Ecological factors
can therefore have a variety of impacts on
the sustainable harvest of bushmeat.
2.	 Demographic factors: Increases in human
population density generally lead to
increased pressure on bushmeat resources. It
is estimated that for people depending solely
on bushmeat, human population densities
should not exceed one person per km2 (see
Robinson & Bennett 2000 but remember
that this is strongly dependent on the actual
reliability of production estimates). Actual
human densities in tropical forests where
hunting is considered sustainable are much
lower. Furthermore, these people live
largely outside a market economy, and tend
to exclude others from their hunting areas
(e.g., Aché, in Paraguay). An important
pressure on wildlife in ‘frontier forests’
comes from local communities (including
new settlements and increased sedentarism
of indigenous forest dwellers), with usually
a high proportion of the population hardly
involved in the traditional economy.
3.	 Technological factors: Changes in
traditional hunting practices through the
use of improved hunting technology (e.g.
shotguns, flashlights, outboard motors)
generally decrease the probability that
hunting will be sustainable since both the
range of species taken, the area hunted and
fatal injury rates increase. In addition the
use of steel wire snares, for any species, also
increase rates of indiscriminate harvest.
4.	 Cultural factors: Hunting, eating of
bushmeat and the use of wildlife artefacts
are integral parts of cultural heritage,
and are closely linked to social status, or

24

believed to provide special or “magic”
forces. These are strong factors in
maintaining the demand for various types
of wildlife products. Loss of traditional
lifestyle usually means that traditional
territories and hunting methods are
abandoned, leading to a loss of the sense of
ownership of land and wildlife. It might be
useful here to distinguish cultural practices
and in particular food habits from cultural
heritage. It is true that the consumption of
bushmeat is a cultural practice and a food
habit in most tropical forest areas. However,
it is also known that these cultural habits
can and will change rapidly in the case of
changes in the availability of resources.
Similarly there are numerous examples of
individuals changing their habits to adapt
to changing economic realities. While it is
true that hunting can be rooted in cultural
heritage (where hunting is part of certain
rituals, or certain products are necessary
for rituals), it seems to be a marginal part
of the bushmeat problem.
5.	 Economic factors: Most of the remaining,
relatively undisturbed forest areas can
be considered as ”frontier zones”, with
usually a low forest land value and more or
less open access. This situation leads to the
degradation of the forests and the wildlife
found within them. Roads, railways, and
other transport infrastructure help to open
up new frontier areas; they contribute
to habitat loss and to the fragmentation
of habitat as well as promote increased
immigration and settlement in new,
formerly undisturbed areas. This improved
access increases the hunting pressure and
facilitates the transport of bushmeat to
markets. Declines in world prices for some
agricultural crops have driven many farmers
to seek alternative sources of income,
and many have become part-time or fulltime hunters. However, the factors that
determine whether a household farms or
hunts are complex. For example, bushmeat
hunting is likely to be more profitable than
farming in enclave areas without easy
access to roads, as the price to weight ratio
of bushmeat is typically higher than for any
agricultural crop, and only small quantities
of goods can be transported on foot to
markets. In the short term, hunting is likely
to be preferred to farming in recently

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

opened forested areas because wildlife is
abundant, communities might not yet have
a tradition of commercial farming, and tree
crops may take several years to harvest.
However in the long term, farming is likely
to be preferred to hunting in communities
that have been residing in a given forest
area for a long time because bushmeat
levels are already likely to be depleted.
6.	 Institutional and governance factors:
Lack of adequate attention to the role of
bushmeat as an important contributor of
local livelihoods by development agencies,
non-governmental and inter-governmental
organizations, and national governments
contributes to the unsustainable hunting of
bushmeat in tropical forests. Even when
present at the national level, policy and legal
frameworks to promote sustainable use of
natural resources are seldom adequate in
remote rural areas. Financial, material, and
training resources are insufficient to allow
law enforcement personnel to adequately
address the illegal commercial trade in
bushmeat and this deficiency decreases the
capacity for control of illegal activities.
Loss of both traditional hunting territories
(e.g., those belonging to certain traditional
groups) and methods (e.g. hunting zone
rotations) allow open access to the resource
and concentration of hunting, thereby
resulting in a loss of sustainability.
As we have shown, estimating both existing
hunting yields and maximum sustainable harvest
rates presents considerable difficulties because of
the various methodological problems highlighted
above. Nevertheless, we are witnessing massive and
completely unmanaged harvesting, in conditions
of ever-increasing public access, improvements
in destructive technologies, wide availability of
arms, ammunition and growing penetration by high
spending and strategically-positioned “elites”. While
doomsday thinking must be treated sceptically,
sustainability for many species does appear
threatened under present conditions. In section 5,
we will analyse in more detail the synergistic factors
affecting the sustainability of hunting.

5. Synergistic factors affecting the
sustainability of hunting
5.1. Nature of the wildlife resource
The very nature of the resource, a low unit value, a
common resource freely accessible and difficult to
assess, is one of the main reasons for its unsustainable
use and encourages free-rider behaviour. Those who
exploit the resource have little ability or incentive to
manage it sustainably. Some of the characteristics of
wildlife resources are (modified from Inamdar et al.
1999):
•
Low ownership. In most countries, wildlife
is either without any owner or is state property and
alienated from the local communities.
•
Non-recognition of user rights. Recognizing
the rights of traditional users in relation to mobile
resources like wildlife poses particular intellectual and managerial challenges. All too often, the
discourse of biodiversity conservation equates low
densities of sedentary human populations and ‘true’
owners with an absence of legitimate user rights, a
confusion which can easily serve to justify transfers
of rights away from the poor and marginal.
•
Criminalization of use. Activities associated with the use of wildlife tend to be criminalised
and wildlife exploitation is often subject to numerous negative sanctions.
•
Difficulty of monitoring the resource.
Despite many years of effort, the quest for practical
and affordable techniques to census forest animals
(especially in dense tropical forests) accurately has
so far eluded ecologists, even for large animals like
elephants and the great apes.
•
Low economic barriers to entry in the
exploitation of the resource. The low cost and wide
availability of hunting technology lowers the barriers to entry into hunting, and its frequent blanket
criminalization only discourages regulation.
5.2. Inappropriate policies and governance
In almost all Amazonian countries, hunting is
prohibited except for sport hunting (see RichardHansen & Hansen 1998). Still, the activity is carried
out at a large scale and legislation is either ignored by
educated, wealthy game hunters or is, in most remote
areas, not taking into account the basic needs for the
very survival of poor local people.
In Central Africa (see Yadji Bello 2003 for a critical
review), the various hunting rules and regulations
(often part of the forestry laws) authorize hunting by
licence holders (“permis spéciaux” in the Congolese
legislation, “permis de chasse” in the Gabonese
forestry code). Hunting is therefore not an illegal

25

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

Text Box 6. Sustainability of wildlife harvests in different tropical ecosystems
The probability that hunting can be sustainable depends in part on ecological conditions that affect the
‘supply’ of and ‘demand’ for wildlife resources. This in turn has implications for management planning,
since hunting is more likely to be sustainable in certain ecosystems than in others.
Supply can be defined as the biomass of wildlife which can be harvested sustainably. Demand can be
defined as the total amount of wildlife hunted in reality. Supply varies across relatively undisturbed
ecosystems, broadly in relation to annual rainfall. Supply is potentially highest in dry forests and wetter
savanna grasslands, and decreases in moist forests and more xeric grasslands. Because of their very low
productivity for wildlife, demand tends to exceed supply in moist forests and xeric grasslands. The balance
between supply and demand in the more productive ecosystems depends on local conditions, including
human population densities, degree of access to forests and potential market pressures, but in theory supply
can match or exceed demand in such systems, and the potential exists for sustainable use management.
Analogous to this ecological variation along the rainfall gradient is the gradient created by the conversion
of tropical forests by humans. In some cases, wild meat supply might be greater in secondary forests and
forest-farm-fallow mosaics than in undisturbed forests, again allowing for potentially higher offtake rates
and a wider range of management options in the former.
The core factors influencing these differences in supply are the productivity and location of food available
to large mammals in the different ecosystems, and also the taxonomic groups of animals predominating
in each. Mammal communities in moist forests tend to be dominated by primates, which generally occur
at relatively low population densities, and have low reproductive rates. Mammal communities in savanna
grasslands and in forest-farm-fallow mosaics tend to be dominated more by ungulates and rodents, which
have higher reproductive rates, and for which sustainable offtake rates are higher (see Text Box 5). Thus, the
probability that hunting will be sustainable varies with ecosystem type and degree of human disturbance.
Within the humid tropics, not only are anthropogenic landscapes more likely to be able to withstand a
higher degree of hunting than undisturbed forests, but also the species present in anthropogenic landscapes
are likely to be ones which are more tolerant of human presence as opposed to the more endangered
species which tend to be restricted more to undisturbed areas. In addition, humans are generally intolerant
of most large-bodied wildlife entering agricultural lands. Thus, anthropogenic landscapes can, in theory,
be areas where the supply of wildlife can match demand, through the harvesting of relatively common,
generally faster-breeding, smaller species.
Management choices should take these ecological differences into account, by planning wildlife use
regimes in areas most likely to be able to sustain such harvesting, and a higher degree of protection in
areas less able to.

26

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

activity per se. If you hold one of these licences and
providing that you do not hunt protected species or
in protected areas, you can hunt and even, provided
that you hold the right official paper, commercialize
the catch. Furthermore, the laws recognize user rights
for the local populations and allow for traditional
hunting and fishing. However, at the same time most
laws forbid, among others, hunting during the night,
the use of metallic snares or traps, of nets, of fire, etc.
All this makes illegal most of the hunting practised
by the local communities (villagers or pygmies do
not hold licences, steel wire is the preferred material
for snares, some species are only hunted at night).
Hunting rules and regulations exist almost
everywhere but they are rarely enforced. There is
clearly an ownership and management problem. The
State is the owner of the resource and issues rules
and regulation to manage it but the State is unable
to enforce its decisions. A law that is not enforced
undermines the authority of the government, and
a law that can only be enforced at great cost and
difficulty might need to be revised. There is much
work to be done in order to tackle this issue in most
tropical countries. The range States6 and their donors
need to take a radical look at all types of natural
resource policies with the clear aim of enhancing the
rights and sustainable livelihoods of rural dwellers.
In Asia, the example of Sarawak (Malaysia) gives
some cause for optimism. A Master Plan for Wildlife
in Sarawak has been developed based on long-term
research and has resulted in the passing and strict
enforcement of a new law banning all trade in wild
animals and their parts, strict control of shotgun

cartridge availability and hunting in logging
concessions, broad education programmes and
involvement of local communities in the management
of protected areas. The 1998 “Wild Life Protection
Ordinance” bans the sales of all wildlife and wildlife
products taken from the wild. It has been put into
effect by intensive programmes of education and
enforcement, and has received strong support from
rural community leaders who see it as conserving the
resources on which their rural constituents depend
(Bennett & Madhu Rao 2002). This was however
possible because in Sarawak (and throughout much
of Asia), the commercial wildlife trade is mainly
supplying a luxury, urban market, both for meat and
traditional medicines. A major part of the problem
in Asia, then, can be solved by strictly controlling
or banning the commercial wildlife trade without
causing nutritional hardship as people in towns do
not depend on wild meat for protein. It seems that
in this context the twin strategy of banning the
trade of bushmeat and setting up a comprehensive
network of well-managed protected areas offers a
potential solution to the issue. It remains however to
be implemented in other regions.
5.3. Demography
What would be the maximum acceptable human
population density in areas where people depend
almost exclusively on wildlife for protein?
According to Robinson & Bennett (2000), studies
worldwide show that population densities for
sustainable hunting cannot be more than one
person per km2. This estimate is based on an average
sustainable production of 150kg/km2/yr of which
65% is edible and a daily need of 0.28kg of meat
per capita. However Fa et al. (2002) found much
higher productivity estimates (1.111 kg/km2/yr in
the Congo basin and 588 kg/km2/yr in Amazonia).
Using the same hypotheses about the percentage
of edible meat and the daily per capita need, the
Congo Basin forests could therefore sustain the local
consumption of 7 persons/km2 while Amazonian
forests could sustain 3 to 4 persons/km2. These values
are significantly higher than the current population
densities found in the forested areas of both regions,
except urban populations.
Based on the WHO recommended daily allowance
(0.75g of protein/day/kg of body weight), the daily
protein need of a 70 kg man would be a total of
52,5g of protein or approximately 170g of meat/
day, assuming that this protein comes from meat

Africa), Central America, South America, and Central and Eastern Asia.

sources alone. A value slightly below the one used
in the previous paragraph but quite consistent with
the values from the literature. Detailed estimates
of average protein intake of African people can be
found in Koppert et al. (1996) and range from 31 to
69g/day which is roughly equivalent to 0.10-0.25 kg
of meat/day. If we also consider that the percentage of
these proteins coming from animal origin (fish and
meat) varies from 4% (Nigeria) to 88% (Cameroon),
our estimates of the carrying capacity of the forests
in Central Africa would be between 2 adult persons/
km2 (productivity 150 kg/km2/yr) and 12 adult
persons/km2/yr (productivity 1111 kg/km2/yr). This
carrying capacity might even be underestimated
as the average individual does not weigh 70 kg but
more likely weighs between 40 and 50 kg.
This variation in carrying-capacity figures illustrates
the need to be very cautious in using such numbers
in policy-related documents. This observation is also
reinforced by the fact that population is unequally
distributed; with cities and coastal areas being more
densely populated than the vast expenses of land in
the interior. Urban people have, in general, access to
a large range of protein sources (including of course
bushmeat) and their consumption of wild meat
is much lower than that of the rural population.
While people living near the coast have access to
fish resources from the sea and rely less than interior
people on bushmeat. A fact clearly demonstrated by
Koppert et al. (1996) in their examination of three
ethnic groups in south-west Cameroon. Therefore
it would appear that the consumption of bushmeat
varies with geographic location as well as population
densities.
Nevertheless, the conventional wisdom and
available literature on the use of renewable natural
resources tells us that demand and harvest increase
with the number of people (see Text Box 1).
High population densities are therefore generally
linked to unsustainable use of wild resources and
of intensification of land uses. We have however
shown that it is very difficult to estimate how many
people can obtain their daily needs of protein from
the forest. There are probable thresholds of human
population density above which hunting becomes
unsustainable but these are likely to be much higher
than the ones claimed by several organizations.
High local population densities in remote forest
areas are generally the result of three phenomena:
internal population increase, sedentarism and
immigration. Places like large camps or small towns
established by extractive industries increase the size
of the sedentary population (migrant or imported

28

workers) and attract a large amount of immigrants
as the living conditions are generally much better
than those in the surrounding villages or towns. One
of the best examples is probably Pokola in NorthCongo where what was a once a small fishing village
with a population of 200 people in the 1970s, is
now a town of 14,000 people, with infrastructure
that rivals that located in the official regional capital
Ouesso (Nsosso 2003).
The sustainability of hunting activities will also likely
vary with the age of the settlement being considered.
If settlements are recent, forest fauna is still rich and
diverse and hunters easily find large prey such as
tapir, buffalo, large antelopes, apes, and wild pigs.
However these densely populated pockets are places
were hunting becomes quickly unsustainable. These
areas should therefore be the focus of intensive
conservation and management actions (Auzel &
Wilkie 2000, Auzel 2001). However if settlements
are long-established they have generally gone
through an extinction filter (most of the vulnerable
species have already been extirpated) and the fauna
is reduced to the most resilient species (Cowlishaw
et al. 2004). Hunters bag rodents, small antelopes,
and small primates. Provided that the population
remains relatively stable, these types of markets are
probably sustainable and do not need attention and
funding for conservation efforts.
5.4. Increased commercialization of the wildlife
harvest
As we have seen in table 1, the commercialization
of bushmeat seems to be prevalent, even in societies
where hunting is considered primarily as a subsistence
activity, with a significant part of the harvest being
sold within the communities themselves.
We will not dwell on the trade of wild fauna products
in this document but it is important to remember that
the overall international trade in animal products is
estimated at US$ 3,851 million (Broad 2001). A large
part of this trade involves the harvest of protected
animals (tigers, bears and tortoises). In principle, this
international trade can be regulated through various
existing mechanisms and monitored by relevant
organizations (CITES, TRAFFIC) but in practice
the value of some products is so high (tiger bones,
rhinoceros horn, some rare live animals for the pet
trade) or considered so vital (some Chinese medicine
components like pangolin scales) that it is likely
to continue until the species in question are close
to extinction. At this point their densities become
so low that harvest or hunting is not economically
viable. However hunting might continue even if not

element. International trade can really only be

level.

economically viable to do so and this may eventually
lead to species extirpation. This situation can occur
in cases where two [or more] species are hunted
simultaneously. While one species might be too
scarce to be actively hunted, it would none the less
be worth the kill if it was found during the course
of hunting for another species. One example of this
type of opportunistic hunting can be seen in the
interactions between the rhinoceros and elephant
hunts. While rhinos were too rare to be economically
hunted by poachers, their presence was a bonus as
it allowed them to opportunistically kill one while
actively hunting elephants (Bulte 2003).
The bushmeat trade is different from the trade
of wildlife fauna products in the sense that its
international component is still very limited.
However, there is evidence of the emergence of
a growing trade for expatriate African or Asian
communities. There is also a growing regional market
among range states. The recognition of this situation
has triggered the creation of a CITES Bushmeat
Working Group. While it is clear that bushmeat is
a trade issue, the international aspect is only the tip
of the iceberg. It may however have an importance
greater than its relative volume would suggest. This
is for at least two reasons:

The bulk of the commercial trade is indeed within
country borders, generally directed towards the
supply of urban centers or extractive industry camps
in the forest. Like other non-timber forest products
(NTFPs), the patterns of bushmeat trade reveal some
distinctive features:
•
It is often linked to other commodities.
•
It only becomes economical on a large
scale when existing infrastructure lowers costs
significantly (i.e. logging roads).
•
Though evidence is uncertain, it seems
that large-scale commerce may often be dominated
by ‘polyvalent’ entrepreneurs with multiple commercial interests, and who are able to operate over
long distances.
•
It seems that political patronage may be a
key factor in the trade.
It is likely that a successful attempt to manage the
trade will disadvantage this category of polyvalent
entrepreneurs. Great care is needed, however,
because these individuals are often well-connected,
and have the means to resist marginalization.
Care is also needed in evaluating the assumption
that these entrepreneurs exploit rural producers, and
that, if they were excluded from the trade, producers
would experience increased prices, without increased
risk.
5.5. Logging and other resource extraction
activities
Wildlife is adversely affected by the industrial
extractive sector (logging, mining, and oil-drilling,
for examples) because in the course of their activities,
companies a) directly destroy critical habitat, disturb
movement patterns and alter behaviour, and b)
indirectly facilitate hunting by building roads and/or
providing hunters transportation. Salaried employees
and their extended families that live in company
camps within or bordering concessions constitute

29

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

30

a significant local source of demand for proteins
(and therefore bushmeat). The establishment of
camps with better living standards than surrounding
villages creates an immigration flux and locally
increases population density. The presence of a large
cash-rich population generates a cascade of changes
within local communities that further exacerbate
the impact on wildlife and increase the volume of
the harvest. Increased income allows hunters to take
advantage of new hunting technologies (such as
cartridges, guns, snare wires, outboard motors, and
headlamps), which in turn allows for more efficient
harvests. As industrial activities stimulate the local
economy, the increased level of income generally
raises the demand for wild meat. For example, per
capita harvest rates in local communities adjacent to
logging or oil-drilling infrastructures are three to six
times higher than in communities remote from such
roads (Robinson et al. 1999, Bolivia; Auzel & Wilkie
2000 –Congo; Auzel 2001, Cameroon; Thibault &
Blaney 2003, Gabon). As a result of these changes
local forest communities are increasingly drawn into
a market economy involving wildlife.
A great deal of attention is presently being given to
attempts to control the wild meat trade by putting
pressure on companies not only to control the
activities of their own employees (banning them from
hunting; preventing them from purchasing wild meat
from forest villagers and transporting it to urban
markets), but also to control the activities of forest
villagers themselves (blocking off their channels for
trade). This approach has evident value and may
help protect the resource. However, there must
be some concern that it is adding to the repressive
nature of public-decision making on wildlife
management and that this process risks becoming a
substitute for effective policy. In general, there is a
need for a more sophisticated analysis of the issues
and the purposes that these repressive activities are
intended to serve. There may be a conflict between
biodiversity and development interests, which can
be addressed by accepting some negotiated tradeoffs between conservation and human welfare. The
arrival of natural-resource-based industries clearly
increase the off take of wildlife based resources but at
the same time, offers the opportunity for poor rural
villagers to increase their welfare by selling wildlife
products - either for local consumption or for sale
in urban centres. If the welfare of such poor people
can be increased without eroding the resource stock,
then this should be encouraged, both for its welfare
benefits and its wider governance effects. While
increased control of the companies operating in
these areas of concern is justified, the solution does
not necessarily lie in the outright ban of all sales on

Logging truck, North Congo
wildlife (or setting up fictive markets in which local
and indigenous communities are allowed to sell
products from production reserves only to company
employees or other villagers). A more complex
response is needed, one which both optimizes the
benefits to local people and fosters their support
for the control measures, without providing an
unnecessary subsidy to a lucrative industry. This will
require a management strategy which goes beyond a
simple interpretation of conservation priorities, and
seeks to build real local buy-in and ownership.
Some promising examples of collaborations with
the industrial sector to curb illegal hunting and
reduce the amount of wildlife-based resource trade
have been documented (see Aviram et al. 2003 for a
review of such initiatives).
5.6. Fragmentation and land-use changes
Forest fragmentation could aggravate the effects of
hunting by, among others:
•
Isolating populations averse to the surrounding habitat matrix (Gascon et al. 1999);
•
Reducing or precluding re-colonisation
of sink areas from adjacent source areas (Robinson
1996);
•
Increasing the amount of forest habitat
accessible to hunters (Peres 2001)
•
Reducing the area of suitable habitat for
species averse to forest edges (Laurance et al. 2000)

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

It remains unclear whether any level of game harvest
could be defined as sustainable in highly fragmented
landscapes, as few studies have quantified large
vertebrate abundance within forest fragments
differentially affected by a history of hunting (see
Chiarello 1999 or Cullen et al. 2000 for examples
of such studies in Brazil). Extirpations of normally
hunted resilient species at heavily hunted sites in
fragmented forests suggest that in forest remnants,
hunting exacerbates the effects of fragmentation, such
as genetics and demographics, and is an important
factor in emptying these forests of large species
over the short term. Some species appear however
resilient to both hunting and fragmentation. Collared
peccaries, for example, are hunted throughout the
highly fragmented Mata de Planalto region, yet there
is no evidence of decreased abundances between
slightly hunted and heavily hunted sites (Cullen et
al. 2000). Such species (that are also those remaining
after extinction filters) are primary candidates for
active management and sustainable use.
5.7. Agricultural sector

Analyses of the temporal distribution of rural
activities illustrates that for most rural households
hunting and fishing activities increase when farming
activities are completed (Pasquet & Koppert 1996,
Wilkie et al. 1998, Takforyan 2001). However garden
hunting is generally practiced year round to protect
crops from animal damages. In Central Africa, the
bulk of this game from the bush-farm matrix is made
of “pests”: rodents, small ungulates and primates
(Dounias 1993, De Wachter 2001). In a recent study
Naughton-Treves et al. (2002) showed the same
trend in an area of Amazonia close to a reserve, and
concluded that:
•
The number of commercial hunters in the
surrounding communities had a stronger impact than
did the individual field owner’s hunting intensity.
•
Large-bodied species appeared only in
remote farms neighbouring uninhabited areas in
the reserve, indicating that undisturbed forests act
as sources for wildlife dispersing into agricultural
regions. Farmers in these remote areas experience
greater crop and livestock losses to wildlife, but by
hunting large game they are able to offset losses
with bushmeat gains (the basic tenet of garden
hunting theory).
•
In more disturbed areas, crop losses exceeded bushmeat gains, although both occurred at
negligible levels.
•
Even highly disturbed forest-agriculture
mosaics are not empty of wildlife, but are inhabited
by a suite of adaptable, fast-reproducing species able

Most farmers derive income or sustain their
livelihoods from a variety of sources among which
NTFP extraction and hunting play a significant
role. Economic crisis and declines in world
prices for several agricultural crops has driven
many unemployed urban inhabitants back to the
countryside as well as forced many rural farmers
to seek alternative sources of income. Many have
become part-time or full-time hunters. The factors
that determine whether a household farms, hunts or
undertakes a combination of the two are complex:
•	 Hunting is likely to be more profitable
than farming in enclave areas without easy
access to roads as the price to weight ratio
of wild meat is typically higher than for any
agricultural crop, and only small quantities
of goods can be transported on foot to
markets;
•	 Hunting is likely to be more profitable in the
short term than farming in isolated areas of
forest that only recently have been opened
up with roads, as wildlife is abundant,
communities may not have a tradition of
commercial farming, tree crops may take
several years to produce, and transportation
costs for agricultural crops will be higher in
isolated areas than those closer to markets;
•	 Farming is likely to be more profitable than
hunting in communities that are adjacent
to roads and that have been inhabited for
a long period time. Though agricultural
crops have a lower unit value than wildlife,

they can be produced in significantly
greater quantities than bushmeat and the
presence of roads makes transporting them
to markets relatively easy.

to withstand human activity.

6. Linkages between bushmeat harvest
and other available protein sources
6.1. Protein from other types of harvested wildlife
(fish, invertebrates)
The two other main sources of wild animal protein in
tropical forest regions are wild fish and invertebrates.
The importance of fish is well-known as both salt
and fresh water species constitute major sources of
protein for tropical forest inhabitants. For example,
in Central African countries, fish resources represent
approximately 25% to 50% of the total food supply
(Watson & Brashares 2004). Animals such as snails
and caterpillars play an important role either as safety
nets for people in years of environmental stress or
as regular source of food and income (Vantomme
et al., 2004). However while the importance of
these animals is generally well-documented their
importance is often ignored in the regulatory
framework and in development assistance.
The consumption of fish and/or bushmeat seems to
be closely linked to both its availability and/or the
price of substitutes. For example:
•
In Pokola town, northern Congo, consumption of wild fish and wild meat are inversely
correlated. During the dry season when river fish are
easily available, their price drops below that of wild
meat, and wild meat consumption decreases. During
the wet season, the opposite occurs.
•
In the Campo area coastal ethnic groups
(Yassa) eat more fish than bushmeat (176g/day vs.
18 g/day) whereas interior groups (Bakola) do the
contrary (18 vs. 201 g/day). Similar observations
have been made within the same ethnic group as
well. For example coastal residents belonging to the
Mvae group consume 94 g/.day of fish and 83 g/day
of meat while interior populations eat 37 g/day of
fish and 164 g/day of meat (Koppert et al. 1996).
•
Brashares et al. in Watson & Brashares
(2004) examined the link between fish supply and
bushmeat species biomass at a national scale. They
illustrated that years of poor fish supply, caused or
aggravated by industrial fishing activities of subsidized fishing fleets, were correlated with relatively
large declines in abundance of bushmeat species.
This potential link at the national level is not fully
explained as most of the fish caught are demersal
species and are directed to export markets. However, the researchers also found that at local scales,
bushmeat and fish availability was closely related in
14 local markets. In each of the markets surveyed,
bushmeat volume and sales were greatest in months

32

when the availability of pelagic fish was poor.
Overall, people who depend on wild protein will
substitute wild fish and wild meat for one another,
depending on the price and availability of each. This
means that a decline in one wild resource tends to
drive up unsustainable exploitation of the other.
However there are incidences were fish is considered
as either an inferior or superior good compared to
bushmeat. This further complicates the situation
by blurring the potential feedback loop between
fish and meat catches. Without good management,
declines in consumption of wild meat, whether
due to management controls or declining wildlife
populations, may lead to unsustainable fishing, and
vice versa. Therefore, for this reason, hunting and
fishing should be managed together both at local and
national levels.
Estimates suggest that in tropical areas worldwide,
probably more than 1,000 terrestrial species of
invertebrates are used as food (De Foliart 1992,
Marconi et al. 2002, Vantomme et al. 2004). In
Amazonia for example, Marconi et al. (2002) show that
the consumption of 100 g of any of these invertebrates
contributed 1.2–9.4% of the daily fat requirement
and 26–144% of the daily protein requirements for
an adult male. They concluded that the consumption
of invertebrates by tropical human populations
represents not only an important traditional habit
but also, considering their nutritional composition,
a substantial contribution to the human diet. There
is also an important livelihood component as
invertebrates are often traded.
Invertebrates also play a significant role in Africa.
Vantomme et al. (2004) observe that when supplies
of bushmeat and fish decline in the rainy season,
it does seem that people rely more on caterpillars
and other available insects. The linkage is not very
clear as both insects and bushmeat are goods with
widely fluctuating prices and availability. This shows
however the actual importance of invertebrates as
human food and in the livelihoods of local people,
a point generally overlooked in most of the studies
about bushmeat consumption.
6.2. Protein from farming, ranching of wildlife or
from domestic animals
Governments and NGOs are already experimenting
with options for reducing the reliance on wild
meat by rearing wild species in captivity (such as
ostriches, crocodiles and cassowaries). However,
many forest species are difficult to rear in captivity
and the captive breeding of only a handful of species
has been mastered. Furthermore wild species are

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

almost always less productive than domesticated
ones (Eltringham 1984, Feer 1993). In addition,
at least initially, the capture of wild species for
“farming” is a drain on wild populations. Since it is
generally impossible for law enforcers to distinguish
captive bred animals from hunted wild ones, captive
facilities could easily become a conduit for illegal
wildlife trade, divert funds, manpower and attention
away from the management of wild animals, and
most importantly, a vector for disease that could
potentially lead to the infection of wild populations.
While the view of farming of domestic livestock
as “the most realistic approach to supply people’s
protein needs in the immediate future” (Bennett &
Robinson 2000) may lead to useful solutions to the
problem of excessive hunting pressure, there is a
need to proceed with caution in this area, given the
concerns outlined above.
In particular the following issues must be considered
(Bowen-Jones et al. 2002):
•
There is rarely any direct link between the
proposed substitution activity and the hunting activity to be foregone. Indeed, in some instances, the
target population differs for the two activities. Hunting appeals to young self-employed male peasant
farmers without significant capital, while ranching
appeals to more wealthy people, able to draw on the
pool of wage labour (especially in the case of cattle
ranching). Thus, there is no guarantee that success
in producing substitute protein sources will reduce
hunting pressure.
•
While the banning of hunting by peasant
farmers and the migration into agricultural day labour may have benefits for the conservation of wild
fauna, such a move may well have negative social
effects (decreased standards of living, population
concentration in urban settlements leading to rising
levels of disease, and increased propensity for social
unrest).
•
The fact that small numbers of domestic
livestock thrive in free-range conditions in forest villages tends to be extrapolated by advocates of protein substitution. Free-range animals usually survive
quite well in what are essentially domestic foraging
conditions around forest villages, but two constraints
may inhibit the scaling-up of production: i) Lack of
sufficient food waste from the domestic household
as villagers produce much less waste food than typical industrial families; ii) Lack of enclosures or fencing. Except where human population densities build
up to high levels (rarely the case in hunting areas), it
may be excessively costly to fence off either animals
or crops. Thus, domesticated animals living in free-

range conditions can only be kept in small numbers
around forest settlements.
•
Economically captive rearing is problematic, particularly where hunted wild animals exist as
a virtually free good.
•
The concentration of small stock in intensive farms is costly, and increases the risk of disease.
It is only feasible close to major urban settlements
with large consumer populations that have significant purchasing power. Generally, where such
schemes have potential, they have already been developed. Increasing the potential would require not
only that the policy and market failures associated
with hunting are addressed but also that the wealth
of the nations increases so as to overcome the purchasing power constraint for the poor.
A recent bio-economic study (Damania & Bulte 2006)
shows that results of supplying alternative protein by
captive breeding schemes are not as straightforward
or as clear-cut as expected in terms of conservation.
By generating supplies from captive-bred animals,
wildlife commodity prices are expected to fall,
thereby lowering the incentive to poach species in
the wild. Supply-side policies, however, often neglect
the institutional framework within which the
wildlife trade takes place, and ignore the potential
strategic responses of economic agents. Adopting a
model that captures imperfect competition between
traders and farmers, the authors analyse the effect of
supply-side policies and conclude that under some
circumstances these policies may contribute to
further devastation of wild stocks.
Finally, a major concern is the risk that alternative
options, valid though they may be, will divert
attention away from the more pressing issue of
bringing hunting under effective management.

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

7. Lessons learned and
recommendations

causes of poverty and biodiversity loss are often
related (Davies 2002).

7.1. Lessons learned

The so-called bushmeat crisis is first and foremost
a problem resulting from an unmanaged common
resource being unsustainably harvested because of
inadequate governance and policy frameworks. The
problem arises out of the way in which the State
monopolizes control over high value timber and
mineral resources in the forest, without necessarily
having the capacity to manage those resources for
real public benefit. As such it should be considered as
a facet of the “tragedy of the commons” and be dealt
with in the broader framework of renewable resource
management (like timber or fuelwood). Ideally, one
would start by putting in place sound governance
regimes for the management of all resources, not
just bushmeat. Sound governance regimes for the
management of all resources are an important
element in the development of the sustainable use
of renewable natural resources. Recent political
developments suggest that decentralization and
devolution of government could contribute to the
more effective and efficient management of local
natural resources. However several examples suggest
that decentralization ends up in privileging a shortterm resource exploitation approach rather than a
long-term sustainability approach because of high
local discount rates or short-term political concerns
and interests. For decentralization to work it has to
go hand in hand with empowerment of the resource’s
users and education on what is sustainable.

The harvesting of wildlife, especially for food, is a
complex problem, one in which biological issues
and conservation concerns should play an important
role alongside livelihood issues. Such a problem has
no simple solution and actions will have to be taken
at all levels from the international policy dialogue
to the field-project level. If attention is focused
solely on field-level initiatives, such as protectedarea management, then the underlying forces
driving unsustainable and unregulated harvest will
continue. Both governance and field issues need to
be addressed concurrently, albeit at different levels.
Hunting or harvesting wildlife is a territorial activity
with three interacting dimensions: space-rulesinstitutions (i.e. nation-no hunting of protected
species-government agencies; swidden-garden
hunting for pest control-farmer household) that
must be considered concomitantly.
At the policy or governance level, many of the
underlying causes of the unsustainable use of
wildlife are the same as those underlying poverty.
For example weak local governance, war, famine
and unfavorable terms of trade impact both poverty
and the use of wildlife. This would seem to suggest
that there is room for conservation and development
agencies to work together (albeit in different ways
and through different agencies) as the underlying

Text Box 7. The role of taste in determining the demand for wild meat
The role of taste and cultural preference in driving the demand for wild meat is unclear. It is commonly
believed that people in tropical forest countries often prefer the taste of wild meat over that of domestic
animals, and that wild meat consumption is a deeply-rooted tradition that is highly resistant to change.
These views are supported by the continuing demand for wild meat from formerly rural people now living
in middle-class urban or even overseas environments, from Jakarta, Libreville and Brazzaville to London
and New York. In these cases, wild meat is consumed as a luxury item to maintain a link to a departed
lifestyle and is not a staple source of animal protein.
Scientific data to determine how important a role taste and culture play in the overall demand for wild
meat is scarce. Most studies of preference have often simply documented that consumers noted “meat
hunger” when their diet is composed primarily of starches, or have focused solely on which species of
wildlife consumers prefer. They have not established that consumers have clear taste preferences for wild
meat relative to the meat of domesticated animals. In a recent study in Gabon, consumers were asked to
select which of two plates of meat they preferred. Only poor rural people showed a measurable preference
for bushmeat. And, of the 42 subjects who stated a preference for domestic poultry, 78% avoided bushmeat
when given the choice of porcupine or chicken. Overall, results suggest that taste is not the primary
determinant of consumer demand for wild meat.

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

Such governance frameworks could be helpful at
addressing land-use issues relevant to the sustainable
harvesting of wildlife (e.g. agriculture, establishment
of protected areas, regulating hunting practices)
at the most appropriate level. In many cases this
would also require a radical re-examination of the
tenurial and resource-rights situations in their rural
areas, including (but not limited to) the bushmeatproducer areas.
However, that is not where we are starting from, for
a variety of historical reasons (not all of them located
in the range States themselves). To the extent that it
can be addressed on its own terms, the resolution
of the problem can only be the product of strategies
that seek to reinforce human rights and to promote
species conservation. This will best be achieved by
fostering individual and group rights and security,
while overall criminalization of the sector is
unhelpful. While some actors on the conservation
constituency have tended to see the solution to the
problem as an application of the law in relation to
protected-area management, the view from the
periphery is often rather different. In contexts where
almost all economic activity by villagers can be
deemed ‘illegal’ in one way or another, there may
be an entirely understandable reluctance to treat
protected areas as worthy of exceptional treatment.
Thus, there is a need to place wildlife management
in a wider framework of social justice and equity.
The aim will be to provide an acceptable framework
for economic and social activity that is supportive
of local cultures, and which leaves decision-making
in the hands of local people without any moral
opprobrium. This will include decisions about what
species to conserve, where to conserve, for whom
to conserve as well as who is going to pay and who
is going to benefit from the conservation initiative.
It should be an approach which empowers local
institutions, yet does not diminish local authority.
Local empowerment of resource users appears to
be a potential key strategy to achieve long-term
sustainability. However the transfer of rights has
to be coupled with the transfer of responsibility for
the conservation of the resource, in balance with
the resources characteristics (e.g. biodiversity) as
a national and global good. At the same time, one
cannot credibly transfer the rights to bushmeat
resources to local communities without addressing
the rights to other resources such as timber and
mining products.
One of the major challenges confronting local
empowerment is that while the obvious solution

seems to empower the poorer rural dwellers to
manage the resource, the formal tenurial rights of
this category of the population are often minimal
to non-existent, and their ability to resist pressures
from powerful political and economic interests is
low. Where rural social structure is complex (for
example in countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire
where there are a large number of migrants in the
forest with weak rights), it will be doubly difficult to
remedy the situation. Another risk or challenge is
that, in seeking to make progress on one front, one
could well take numerous steps backwards on others.
For example, the control over such fugitive resources
is inherently decentralized. While this has many
negative features (not least of which are opportunities
for ‘rent-seeking behavior’ by officials), it does mean
that the poor derive some residual benefits from the
operation of the market chain, however limited these
are. There is a need to ensure that any solutions
which are offered should not remove these benefits,
and preferably, further enhance them.
The case for international assistance to support the
development of a well regulated bushmeat industry
must be based in the first instance on recognition of
its important livelihood benefits, and in the second,
on its potential to contribute positively to the growth
of good governance of the broader forest resource
at the country level. An essential prerequisite for
the latter must be to bring the bushmeat trade
into the open and clearly identify the possibilities
for legal and legitimate trade. The very first step
should probably be the recognition of wild-meat
harvest and consumption in national statistics
(Asibey & Child 1991). What has been lacking to
date is an understanding of the centrality of social
interests to conservation goals. As others have noted,
sustainability is not, at the end of the day, an issue
of purely biological concern (Hutton and Dickson
2002). To argue that social and livelihood issues are
more pressing is merely to acknowledge that the
decisions regarding what resources to retain and
what to consume will ultimately be made by those
whose lives are directly affected by their day-to-day
contact with the wildlife resource, while it is in their
best interest to achieve a sustainable management of
the resource (Brown & Williams 2003).
It is likely that management of the bushmeat sector
could learn a lot by using examples (both successes
and failures) from other renewable natural resource
sectors. The natural candidate could be the fishery
sector because of the commonalities in the nature
of the resource (see Bowen-Jones et al. 2002 and
Cochrane 2000 for a comparison of the principles

35

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

of effective fisheries and their potential relevance
to bushmeat management). The use of rights-based
management systems (e.g. individual transferable
quotas) and productivity monitoring tools based on
catch data (and not on count data or on models based
on dubious and unproven assumptions) could offer
some promise for wild meat management (Inamdar
et al. 1999). Optimism must however be tempered
as failures in the fisheries sector have nevertheless
occurred despite massive investments in management
on a national and international scale. Another sector
that could offer some solutions or ideas is fuelwood.
Studies of local markets for fuelwood in the Sahel
show clearly that the transfer of rights and sector
management to local people could be at least as good
for the environment as when national governments
were in charge and certainly much better in terms of
improved local livelihoods (Mahamane et al. 1995,
Mahamane & Montagne 1997).
7.2. Some recommendations towards a more
sustainable use of wildlife resources
7.2.1. Preamble
1.	 It needs to be recognized at the outset that
the bushmeat problem (to the extent that it
can be spoken of in this generalized way)
is a problem of sovereign States. Nationals
of these States are often under-represented
in the current international debate, and it
would follow, as a consequence, that the
national interests of the range states are
also likely to be under-represented. One
immediate caveat here is that governments
in many cases do not adequately represent
the interest of local stakeholders. The
example of the management of timber and
mining resources demonstrates this. So
there is a need to go beyond the government
level and involve civil society.
2.	 This is an immense and intractable problem.
It has hitherto tended to be treated in
terms of the need to achieve short-term
sustainability, an approach which tends to
require urgent imposition of heavy control
measures. For a variety of reasons, these
have often not been very effective. A more
realistic starting point might be to treat the
problem as one of ‘helping range states to
better manage a resource in unpropitious
circumstances’ – not of seeking to
impose idealistic and externally-defined
conservation aims as a short-term strategy.

36

3.	 Renewed efforts are needed to build up
national ownership of conservation issues
and interests. This will require a much
greater willingness to accommodate the
realities of a multi-million dollar trade,
and of cultural practices which favour
consumptive use of wildlife.
4.	 However
short-term
sustainability
measures can be useful to gain time while
a more broad policy process is engaged.
There is no need to provide another list
of the possible short term field-based
measures as comprehensive reviews and
lists of such recommendations can be
found in the literature (Bailey 2000, Bennet
& Robinson 2000, Bowen-Jones et al. 2002,
IIED & TRAFFIC 2002, Mainka & Trivedi
2002, etc.). It is however crucial to stress
that these recommendations are by nature
very much site and condition specific and
that indiscriminate blanket decisions made
based on such recommendations are to be,
at best ineffective and, at worst, counterproductive.
5.	 Proper wildlife management techniques,
including developing databases of
existing information, census of indicators
to populations, monitoring of results,
modelling of populations, and planning
wildlife management in the context of
forest management may provide assistance
in instances where funds are available to
help manage key wildlife populations.
6.	 Parties need to assess local and
transboundary priorities for conservation
among the species harvested for bushmeat.
For example, species that are endangered,
species with restricted ranges, species
in declining habitats etc. These species
require priority action by and among
governments.
7.2.2. Recommendations
7.2.2.1. National level – in the bushmeat range States
1.	 National policy linkages: There is an urgent
need to ‘lift the policy debate onto a higher
plane’. This involves giving greater attention
to governance issues at appropriate levels
(policy and legislation, links to development
assistance priorities through Poverty
Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), etc.),

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

and treating the high-value bushmeat trade
as an aspect of the national economy as well
as an international animal welfare concern.
The bushmeat economy is largely nonvisible.
Acknowledging the role of
bushmeat and other animal products in
the local economy will be a first essential
step in sustainable management of this
resource. Inclusion of information on
bushmeat and animal products in national,
official statistics may be a next step in order
to better understand its role in the country’s
economy, and as a contributor to local
livelihoods and food security. Hunting
for bushmeat and other animal products
usually occurs in remote areas (‘frontier
development zones’), where national
institutions have limited power and where
law enforcement usually is less intense
– if even existent at all. To some extent,
decentralization (devolution) can help to
involve local groups in policy development,
planning and management of local
resources; non-governmental organization
and development programmes can play a
positive role, but solving the often conflicting
interests of all local stakeholders remains
a great challenge. Forest exploitation
has an impact on bushmeat hunting in
several ways: it provides increased access
to hunters, attracts more temporary or
permanent settlements and, last but not
least, it affects wildlife habitat. Therefore
wildlife management should be an integral
part of (mandatory) forest management
plans.
2.	 Enhancing ownership and links to tenurial
and rights reform: Initiatives should be
promoted to transfer ownership to the
people so as to stimulate an interest in
sustainable land use and hunting practices,
and guarantee local people the benefits
of these activities (related to institutional
arrangements).
In significant measure the bushmeat
problem is often a problem of rights. Rural
dwellers lack rights to the resources they
need to secure their livelihoods, wildlife
included, and hence their unwillingness
to invest in wildlife management is only to
be expected. Wildlife is one of a range of
assets (land and trees are two others) which

need to be brought within a secure rights
regime. Measures to reform the tenurial
systems pertaining to all of these resources
are urgently needed, if the problem of
high discount rates is to be overcome.
Opportunities exist within the ‘Poverty
Reduction Strategy’ process to progress
the rights and tenurial changes needed
to ensure sound management of rural
resources, bushmeat included.
The aim should be to increase the incentives
to local populations to manage local
resources in their own - and the national interest (Text Box 2 provides some example
of successful programs to reduce hunting to
sustainable levels). This is likely to involve
giving local users the right of exclusivity
over the legitimate use of the resource – i.e.
the right to exclude external hunters and
agents from the legal harvest.
3.	 Legitimizing the bushmeat debate: Policy is
unlikely to be advanced as long as bushmeat
is stigmatized in public discourse. There
is an urgent need to remove the stigma
surrounding this lucrative trade. The aura
of illegality which surrounds all aspects of
the trade is unhelpful to the policy process,
and is preventing a sound assessment
of management requirements. This
legitimization would involve:
a.	 Increasing the visibility of the
existing trade, as a necessary
precursor
to
getting
its
management onto a sounder
footing.
b.	 Bringing levels of existing wild
meat consumption into national
statistics, as a means of valuing the
resource and giving it appropriate
weight in public policy and
planning.
c.	 Bringing in a realistic and
open assessment of wildlife
consumption and its role in
livelihoods into the major policy
documents – particularly PRSPs,
but also PSIAs and other national
resource assessments.
d.	 Taking account of the wild meat
trade and hunting activities in
national planning.

37

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

Inter alia, this would encourage an approach
in which the various public institutions
(different ministries and services of
government, for example) could be
brought together to deliberate on effective
solutions.
Moves to legalize a portion of the trade
would also increase the reliability of
information on the organization of the
bushmeat commodity chain. As matters
stand, little is known about the potential
for a legal chain, or for adding value to the
commodity chain in a way that is sound in
terms both of biodiversity (conservation
effects) and development (poverty
reduction).
4.	 Legislative review: National legislation on
wildlife and hunting often suffers from
incoherence and impracticality. Wellestablished and widely accepted practices
may be de jure illegal (increasing the
opportunities for rent-seeking by officials)
and the steps required to achieve legality
may be so impractical as to encourage
illegality on the part of otherwise lawabiding citizens.
Range States are therefore encouraged to
review their existing legislation for:
a.	 Policy
coherence
and
incoherence;
b.	 Practicality and feasibility;
c.	 Potential
for
positive
discrimination in the trade
– rationalizing and legalizing the
lower risk elements (for example
production
from
disturbed
environments and farm bush,
off take of highly reproductive
vermin species) and offering
trade-offs which allow for greater
discrimination and protection of
at-risk species;
d.	 A more realistic approach to
enforcement, in which control
measures are brought more into
line with capacity, and trade-offs
are accepted with actual realities;
e.	 Rationalization of the law to
reflect actual practice, without
surrendering key conservation
concerns.
This would often
involve diminishing the emphasis

38

f.	

on a dubious distinction between
‘subsistence use’ and ‘commercial
trade’;
Cross-sectoral linkages with
poverty-reduction
strategies,
forest management policies,
NBSAPs, etc.

5.	 Protected areas: Protected areas are an
essential component of any strategy for
sustainable use of wildlife at the landscape
level and large protected areas will be
essential if we want to conserve the larger
animals. However, a rational approach
to protection policy is required, giving
greater attention to the identification and
quantification of the priority hot-spots and
conservation areas, with due regard to all
aspects of sustainability, and harmonizing
protected-area policy with the limitations
of actual capacities (human resource and
financial). The fact that biodiversity hotspots are often associated with human
settlement and impact renders this a
challenging issue.
Over-reliance on exclusion areas, without
adequate regard to existing patterns of
resource use, is unlikely, on the face of it, to
offer the best path to effective conservation.
In such circumstances, it could be argued
that, by concentrating game species in a
defined area, the strict protection perversely
acts to increase the incentives to harvest
the resource, and sows the seeds of its own
demise. A radical re-think may be needed.
Where feasible (i.e. for non-territorial
species), protected area management should
be allied with wider land-use practices – for
example, on the ‘sources and sinks’ and/or
fisheries ‘no-take area’ within productive
areas models.
6.	 Management interventions: Range State
governments should seek means to ally
control of the bushmeat trade with other
aspects of natural resource management,
benefiting from the economies to scale of
joint enterprise. There are clear linkages
between this and the tenurial and legislative
reforms outlined above.
Bushmeat hunting can be very profitable,
especially when extraction rates are
unsustainable. One of the key problems is

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

to find a balance between the short term
benefits and sustainable development
without complete depletion of the natural
resources. The values of wildlife both in
the national economy and in the informal
economy should be recognized at a more
local scale.
7.	 The role of science in wildlife policy: Heavy
investments have been made in bushmeat
range states in relation to the scientific
study of wildlife populations and the
impacts of their use. The value of this
research has been limited by its frequent
close association with advocacy for animal
welfare interests, usually representing
the interests of external groups and
constituencies. Much greater attempts are
needed to separate out the science from
the advocacy, and to clarify the bases on
which science is made available to policy
makers. Support is needed to increase the
information base of national policy makers
(government and non-government) and to
reduce their dependence on advocacy-based
organizations with external constituencies
and mandates.
8.	 Engaging the private sector: Approaches
to conservation in production forests
have tended to focus on restricting the
impact of timber concessionaires and their
personnel. While these efforts are in many
ways to be commended, there have, to
date, been rather limited efforts to consider
the implications for the livelihoods and
welfare of locally-resident populations.
Policy development needs to go beyond
the interests of the reputable loggers and
the external organizations, and to embrace
public participation of the citizenry at a
higher level.
9.	 Public planning: Greater attempts may be
needed to bring conservation issues within
the frame of development planning, so
that pressures on the wildlife resource
are mitigated by the opening up of wider
opportunities for the populations which
have hitherto depended on hunting and
the bushmeat trade. Income-generating
opportunities need to be offered in
ways which absorbs labour which might
otherwise be rationally deployed in hunting
and the bushmeat trade.

Policies aimed at poverty reduction can
be as important as developing a legislative
framework for hunting. Such policies
could (should) include the establishment
of clear land tenure and land-use rights,
development of alternative sources of
proteins, and involvement of indigenous
and local communities in land use planning
and natural resource management. Smallscale animal husbandry (investment,
secure land tenure arrangements, food
and fodder crops). But the land needed
for such development would inevitably
create another pressure on tropical forest.
Farming wildlife appears quite difficult
but encouraging examples exist in savanna
ungulate ranches, crocodile farms, butterfly
farms, etc.
10.	 Learning processes: Greater attempts are
needed to investigate and build on the
experience of other sectors for ideas and
models which might help to improve
the management of the bushmeat trade.
Relevant sectors might include sea fisheries
[the experience of North Atlantic cod
fisheries, etc.], the pharmaceutical industry,
herbal medicines, etc.
11.	 Substitution and other palliative measures:
A shift in thinking is needed, away from
palliative measures intended to mitigate
the effects of wildlife harvest with
minimum implications for the status quo
(e.g. captive breeding of game species;
livestock breeding schemes intended to
replace existing sources of animal protein;
ICDPs) towards more radical measures
to improve management and governance.
As matters stand, the purchasing power
constraint severely restricts the positive
impact of schemes intended to divert local
populations away from consumptive uses
of wildlife.
7.2.2.2. International level:  
1.	 The need for national ownership: The
international community is called on to
give much greater support to range states to
bring the bushmeat problem under effective
national ownership in ways which provide
broad national benefits. One area where
this process is underway is with the CITES
Great Ape Enforcement Task Force Country

39

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

Profiles which may help develop this sense
of ownership by assisting countries in
determining or identifying some of the key
issues associated with the bushmeat trade.
2.	 Democratic process: Host governments need
to be supported to open up the national
debate on wildlife management, and to
bring this within the democratic process.
3.	 Policy processes: International partners
should seek to ensure that wildlife issues
are, wherever relevant, adequately covered
within internationally supported policy
processes, such as poverty reduction
strategies.
4.	 Trade relations: More consideration needs
to be given to the issue of the conservation
implications of unfavorable terms of trade
between wealthy and developing nations. A
case in point may be international fisheries
policy and fisheries licensing agreements,
where there is some evidence of possible
linkages with bushmeat consumption levels.
To the extent that this evidence is confirmed,
the manipulation of international trade
patterns relating to marine fisheries
could well provide a surrogate means of
influencing the bushmeat trade in positive
directions.
5.	 International trade in wildlife: An area
of particular international interest is the
potential for the high-value export arm of
a segmented trade in wild meat to act as
a force for the rationalization of the trade,
and as a means of adding greater value to
the lower levels of the bushmeat commodity
chain. As matters stand, legitimate channels
for export of wild meat simply do not exist
in most of the major range States, and this
may serve as an incentive to illegality.
Control of hunting of bushmeat and other
animal products always will remain a
difficult task, even when plenty of money,
trained staff, and equipment are available.
One of the basic requirements for control of
hunting is full support of local communities
that have a vested interest in protecting
their resources. Control of trade, at both
national and international levels can be
a feasible instrument to reduce hunting
pressure on wildlife species. International

40

control is fairly successfully controlled by
CITES, and in some cases trade in (certified)
animals or animal products has contributed
to sustainable development of indigenous
and local communities. Trade at local and
national level is less subject of regulations,
but might provide opportunities, e.g. by
providing tax revenues. In some cases
unfortunately, it is only a source of income
for a few powerful persons.		
				
Control of demand for bushmeat and
other animal products is also a complex
issue. Demand is only partly price-driven
(high price/low demand, and shift to other
products). Other aspects of the demand are
based on tradition, status, or the alleged
secret powers derived from bushmeat and
other animal parts. Generally a shift in the
demand of bushmeat can be stimulated
when sufficient alternatives are available
at low cost (e.g. replacing bushmeat with
farmed animals or fish). To what extent
such replacements are feasible for nonprice driven consumption based on belief
in super-natural powers derived from
bushmeat and other animal products is not
clear (e.g. Viagra pills instead of gorilla meat
and rhino horns). Nevertheless, education
of people in the areas of the world that hold
these beliefs may be a key to reducing the
demand for animal parts, especially when
species are threatened.
6.	 International policy environment: In general
terms, international policy might be well
advised to give less emphasis to restrictive
and repressive measures in the bushmeat
range States, and to give greater attention
to the positive incentives which may be
required to better manage the wildlife
resource.
No universal solutions exist to solve the problem
of unsustainable bushmeat hunting in tropical
forests. Approaches must be nation, site and
context-specific, be based on a detailed knowledge
of hunting patterns and the ecology of the hunted
species and be tailored to local cultural, socioeconomic and political conditions. However, overall
management actions may include a monitoring
and feedback mechanism, an iterative process to
ensure that management is achieving its goal of
ensuring sustainability of harvest, and sustainable
livelihoods of local communities. Some principles

Conservation and use of wildlife-based resources: the bushmeat crisis

need to be taken into account in order to achieve the
sustainability of bushmeat hunting. The following
are some ideas for such principles:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Ensure that research is linked to the practices
Mitigate against the potential for tension
between livelihood and conservation objectives
Analyse the livelihood implications of a given
intervention on all stakeholders
Search alternative models from other sectors
Identify the most appropriate entry points
Employ multi-pronged approaches to a complex
problem by involving different stakeholders
Recognize the limited relative significance of
the international dimensions of the bushmeat
trade.
