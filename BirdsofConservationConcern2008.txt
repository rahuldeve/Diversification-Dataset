EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
 
The 1988 amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act mandates the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (USFWS) to identify species, subspecies, and populations of all migratory 
nongame birds that, without additional conservation actions, are likely to become candidates for 
listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Birds of Conservation Concern 2008 
(BCC 2008) is the most recent effort to carry out this mandate.  The overall goal of this report is 
to accurately identify the migratory and non-migratory bird species (beyond those already 
designated as federally threatened or endangered) that represent our highest conservation 
priorities.  The geographic scope of this endeavor is the United States in its entirety, including 
island "territories" in the Pacific and Caribbean.  BCC 2008 encompasses three distinct 
geographic scalesNorth American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) Bird Conservation 
Regions (BCRs), USFWS Regions, and Nationaland is primarily derived from assessment 
scores from three major bird conservation plans: the Partners in Flight North American Landbird 
Conservation Plan, the United States Shorebird Conservation Plan, and the North American 
Waterbird Conservation Plan.   
 
Bird species considered for inclusion on lists in this report include nongame birds, gamebirds 
without hunting seasons, subsistence-hunted nongame birds in Alaska; and Endangered Species 
Act candidate, proposed endangered or threatened, and recently delisted species.  Assessment 
scores from all three bird conservation plans are based on several factors, including population 
trends, threats, distribution, abundance, and relative density.  These assessment scores serve as 
the foundation on which we built the BCC 2008 lists.  Although the different bird conservation 
plans use somewhat different methods for determining the highest priority species, the scores 
from each represent true conservation priorities for each of the three species groups (landbirds, 
shorebirds, and waterbirds).  We therefore view the conservation priorities within each plan as 
approximately equivalent.  After creating BCR lists, we developed specific criteria for including 
species on USFWS Region and National lists.  The various BCR lists contain 10 to 53 species, 
USFWS Region lists contain 27 to 78 species, and the National list contains 147 species.  On 
average, priority species make up about 10 to 15 percent of the native bird species in any given 
geographic unit.   
 
While all of the bird species included in BCC 2008 are priorities for conservation action, this list 
makes no finding with regard to whether they warrant consideration for ESA listing.  Our goal is 
to prevent or remove the need for additional ESA bird listings by implementing proactive 
management and conservation actions.  We recommend that these lists be consulted in 
accordance with Executive Order 13186, Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect 
Migratory Birds.  This report should also be used to develop research, monitoring, and 
management initiatives.  BCC 2008 is intended to stimulate coordinated and collaborative 
proactive conservation actions among Federal, State, Tribal, and private partners.  We hope that, 
by focusing attention on these highest-priority species, this report will promote greater study and 
protection of the habitats and ecological communities upon which these species depend, thereby 
contributing to healthy avian populations and communities.

INTRODUCTION 

 
 
The purpose of this document is to identify migratory and non-migratory birds of the United 
States and its territories that are of conservation concern so as to stimulate coordinated and 
proactive conservation actions among Federal, State, Tribal, and private partners.  The 
conservation concerns may be the result of population declines, naturally or human-caused small 
ranges or population sizes, threats to habitat, or other factors.  The primary statutory authority 
for Birds of Conservation Concern 2008 (BCC 2008) is the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act 
of 1980 (FWCA), as amended; other authorities include the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 
1973, the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, and 16 U.S.C.  701.  The 1988 amendment (Public 
Law 100-653, Title VIII) to the FWCA requires the Secretary of the Interior, through the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), to identify species, subspecies, and populations of 
all migratory nongame birds that, without additional conservation actions, are likely to become 
candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  BCC 2008 is the most recent 
effort by the USFWS to carry out this proactive conservation mandate and update Birds of 
Conservation Concern 2002 (USFWS 2002).  The overall goal of this report is to accurately 
identify those species (beyond those already federally listed as threatened or endangered) in 
greatest need of conservation action at three different geographic scales.  
 
A primary goal of the USFWS is to conserve avian diversity in North America (USFWS 1990, 
2004).  This goal includes reducing or removing threats that may necessitate that a species be 
considered for listing under the ESA.  The Birds of Conservation Concern are largely a subset of 
a larger list known as the Birds of Management Concern (BMC).  The BMC is a subset of all 
species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA, see 50 CFR 10.13), and includes 
those which pose special management challenges due to a variety of factors (e.g., too few, too 
many, conflicts with human interests, or societal demands) (USFWS 2004).   The BMC includes 
both game birds below their desired condition and nongame birds.  As indicated in its strategic 
plan (USFWS 2004), the Migratory Bird Program places priority emphasis on these birds in its 
activities.  
 
The philosophy underlying this report is that proactive bird conservation is necessary at a time 
when human impacts are at an all-time high.  We strongly believe that a well-designed program 
that addresses resource-management issues up front will prevent or remove the need to consider 
listing species as threatened or endangered, and will promote and conserve long-term avian 
diversity in the United States.  In addition, proactive conservation clearly is more cost-effective 
than the extensive recovery efforts required once a species is federally listed under the ESA.  
Our intent is for BCC 2008 to stimulate coordinated efforts to develop and implement 
comprehensive and integrated approaches for the study, management, and protection of non-
ESA listed bird species deemed to be in the most need of additional conservation actions. It 
should also be noted that, while the inclusion of native species not listed under the MBTA is 
beyond the scope of the FWCA, the USFWS has an incentive to encourage proactive 
management of these species by State agencies and other partners to prevent the need for listing 
them as endangered or threatened.

Bird species assemblages, guilds, or communities have recently been promoted as indicators of 
ecological integrity in a variety of habitats (Bradford et al. 1998, OConnell et al. 2000, 
Canterbury et al. 2000, Venier and Pearce 2007), and at-risk bird species are good measures of 
ecosystem threats (Beissinger et al. 1996).  Setting priorities in conservation is crucial because 
resources are limited.  Many systems for setting wildlife-conservation priorities have been 
proposed. Some have focused heavily on identifying and quantifying threats to endangered or 
rare species (Master 1991, Wilcove et al. 1998).  Others have focused on highlighting species 
that deserve attention due to threats to their populations, widespread or long-term declines, or 
low potential for population recovery (Millsap et al. 1990).  The Canadian Wildlife Service 
developed a priority ranking system that focuses on conservation concerns and agency 
responsibilities to assist in setting conservation priorities for landbird species (Dunn 1997, Dunn 
et al. 1999).  The mandate of the 1988 FWCA amendment requires a more proactive approach.   
 
BCC 2008 uses current conservation assessment scores from three bird conservation plans: 
Partners in Flight North American Landbird Conservation Plan (PIF; Rich et al. 2004), the 
United States Shorebird Conservation Plan (USSCP; Brown et al. 2001, USSCP 2004), and the 
North American Waterbird Conservation Plan (NAWCP, Kushlan et al. 2002).  Waterfowl game 
species covered by the North American Waterfowl Management Plan  (Canadian Wildlife 
Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Secretario de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, 
2004) are specifically excluded from the BCC list in accordance with the FWCA of 1980.  
Species in need of additional conservation attention are identified at three distinct geographic 
scales: North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) Bird Conservation Regions 
(BCRs; U.S. NABCI Committee 2000a, 2000b, 2000c), USFWS Regions, and National. 
 
Assessment scores are based on several parameters including population trend, threats, 
distribution, abundance, and the importance of an area to a species.  Partners in Flight, a 
coalition of Federal and State government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private 
interests, developed species assessment scores out of concern for the sharp declines in many 
North American landbirds (Rich et al. 2004).  The PIF approach (Carter et al. 2000, Rich et al. 
2004) has been peer-reviewed by an independent body of avian biologists (Beissinger et al. 
2000).  Similar coalitions have prepared and reviewed conservation assessment scores for 
shorebirds at the National scale (Brown et al. 2000, USSCP 2004), and in step-down regional 
shorebird conservation plans (see http://www.fws.gov/shorebirdplan) and for waterbirds at the 
continental scale (Kushlan et al. 2002) and in step-down regional waterbird conservation plans 
(see http://www.waterbirdconservation.org).  Additionally, we found it necessary to develop 
conservation assessment scores for species not yet evaluated by any of the bird conservation 
plans, such as Pacific Island birds.  Taken together, these assessment scores can be used to 
develop a comprehensive set of integrated bird conservation priorities; this represents a unique 
conservation effort unmatched in any other major group of organisms in North America.

Why Did We Create Lists at Different Geographic Scales? 

 
Listing birds of conservation concern at three geographic scales maximizes the utility of the lists 
for a variety of partner agencies and organizations.  The different geographic scales, from 
smallest to largest, are as follows: 
 
Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs).  We have adopted BCRs as the smallest of our geographic 
scales.  BCRs have been endorsed by the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI, 
U.S. NABCI Committee 2000a, 2000b, 2000c) as the basic units within which all-bird 
conservation efforts will be planned and evaluated (Fig. 1).  The NABCI is an endeavor to 
increase the effectiveness of bird conservation at the continental level and currently includes the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico.  Its goal is to deliver the full spectrum of bird conservation 
through regionally based, biologically driven, landscape-oriented partnerships (U.S. NABCI 
Committee 2000a).  A published map of BCRs and accompanying written descriptions of each 
are available (U.S. NABCI Committee 2000b, 2000c).  The BCR lists will be most useful to 
Federal land-managing agencies and their partners in their efforts to abide by the bird 
conservation principles embodied in the MBTA and Executive Order 13186, Responsibilities of 
Federal agencies to protect migratory birds (Clinton 2001).  The NABCI has recognized 35 
BCRs that cover the contiguous 48 States, Alaska, and Hawaii, numbered 1 to 5, 9 to 37, and 67 
(Hawaii) (U.S. NABCI Committee 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, http://www.nabci-us.org/bcrs.html).  
For purposes of this report, we created two additional BCRs to encompass island territories of 
the United States,1 Other U.S. Pacific Islands (i.e., excluding Hawaii) and U.S. Caribbean 
Islands.  In the BCC 2002 report, these two BCRs were referred to as BCR 68 for the Pacific 
Ocean and BCR 69 for the Caribbean, but those designations were changed for BCC 2008 
because NAWCP uses those numbers to refer to marine areas (pelagic BCRs).  Although BCC 
                                                 

1 Island "territories" and other affiliations of the United States considered in this 

document include (a) American Samoaan unincorporated and unorganized territory; (b) Baker 
Islandan unincorporated territory administered by the USFWS as a National Wildlife Refuge 
(NWR); (c)  Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islandsaligned through a covenant of 
"political union"; (d) Guaman unincorporated organized territory; (e) Howland Islandan 
unincorporated territory administered by the USFWS as a NWR; (f) Jarvis Islandan 
unincorporated territory administered by the USFWS as a NWR; (g) Johnston Atollan 
unincorporated and unorganized territory under joint operational control of the Department of 
Defense and USFWS (and administered as a NWR); (h) Kingman Reefan unincorporated 
territory administered by the USFWS as a NWR; (i) Midway Atollan unincorporated territory 
administered by the USFWS as a NWR; (j) Navassa Islandadministered by the USFWS as a 
NWR; (k) Palmyra Atollan incorporated territory that is partially privately owned and partially 
administered by USFWS as an NWR; (l) Commonwealth of Puerto Ricoa commonwealth; (m) 
U.S. Virgin Islandsan unincorporated organized territory; and (n) Wake Islandan 
unincorporated territory administered by the Department of the Interior (Central Intelligence 
Agency 2001).

2008 does not adopt the pelagic BCR system, it recognizes that some BCC species occur in the 
U.S. primarily or only at sea.  These species are listed under the adjacent terrestrial BCR.  Thus, 
there are 37 BCR lists of priority species. 
  
USFWS Regions.  BCC lists are presented in this document for 8 USFWS Regions.2  The 
USFWS Region lists will be useful to USFWS administrators and biologists, other Federal and 
State agencies within a Region, and their partners and cooperators.  
  
National.  The National list encompasses the United States in its entirety, including island 
"territories" in the Caribbean and the Pacific.  The National list should be viewed as a barometer 
of the status of U.S. bird populations, providing an "early warning" of birds that may decline to 
levels requiring ESA protection unless additional conservation measures are taken.  The National 
list will be most useful as an outreach tool for educating the public about the precarious status of 
bird species in the U.S.  It will also be useful for National bird conservation planning.  The 
National list should not be used to foster bird conservation at smaller geographic scales; that is 
the purpose of the BCR and USFWS Region lists.   
 
Although there are other lists of this nature, such as the National Audubon Society/American 
Bird Conservancy 2007 WatchList (Butcher et al. 2007), BCC 2008 is the only list that meets 
USFWS mandates for the conservation of migratory nongame birds. Conservation organizations 
create lists of concern that reflect their unique missions, and it is important to keep this in mind 
when comparing lists.  With regard to birds, the USFWS focuses on its trust responsibilities as 
defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, which excludes, for example, gallinaceous birds 
(resident game birds) unless they are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA).  Similarly, the Birds of Conservation Concern, as mandated by 
Congressional legislation, excludes birds regulated as hunted species and birds listed under the 
ESA.  Nongovernmental organizations like American Bird Conservancy (ABC) or National 
Audubon are not limited by these legal distinctions, and as a result they can provide lists that are 
more inclusive. The USFWS Birds of Conservation Concern, the ABC/Audubon Watch List, and 
a number of other lists share a common base: they are all reliant on the conservation assessments 
of the major bird partner initiatives and the surveys upon which those initiative assessments are 
grounded.  National Audubon, American Bird Conservancy, and the USFWS are all partners, 
among others, in participating in the assessments of those initiatives.

The various species groups considered for inclusion in BCC 2008 are described in Table 1 and 
include nongame birds; gamebirds without hunting seasons; subsistence-hunted nongame birds 
in Alaska; and Endangered Species Act candidate, proposed endangered or threatened, and 
recently delisted species.   The major groups of species not considered in this assessment are (1) 
migratory gamebirds for which hunting regulations are established (i.e., cooperatively managed 
by Federal-State flyway councils); (2) species that are peripheral to the U.S. (i.e., population 
fragments within U.S. jurisdiction are too small to be managed capably); (3) species, subspecies, 
and populations of federally-endangered or -threatened birds (i.e., those subject to the provisions 
of the ESA); (4) resident gamebirds (i.e., managed by State wildlife agencies), unless listed as a 
federal ESA candidate; and (5) non-native species. 
 
Because the assessments of the three bird conservation initiatives that we use here are all 
species-based, assessment scores were available only for full species.  However, where 
appropriate, subspecies and populations are included in this assessment based on geographic 
range, federal candidate status, or available local data.  Such subspecies and populations are 
noted on lists at all three geographic scales.  
 
In the spirit of all-bird conservation, we include native species not specifically covered by the 
MBTA when they are deemed to be conservation priorities, as long as they are not part of one 
the groups excluded from consideration (see above).  To avoid confusion, we clearly 
differentiate between those species that are and are not protected by the MBTA.  A list of species 
protected by the MBTA is found in Title 50, Part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.   
 
 
 
The methods used to assess and prioritize species differ between PIF, the USSCP, and the 
NAWCP.  These differences relate to geographic scope, factor thresholds, and treatment of 
uncertainty.  Although the methods for determining the highest-priority species are somewhat 
different among the different initiatives, scoring reflects state-of-the-art conservation 
assessments for each of the three species groups (landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds); we 
therefore view the conservation priorities within the three conservation plans as approximately 
equivalent. 
 
PIF Assessment Scores.  We used assessment scores from the PIF Species Assessment Database 
(version 2005, with unpublished 2007 updates) housed at the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory, 
which we believe were the best available data at the time this report was prepared.  In this 
database a panel of bird species experts has assigned each landbird species in North America 
scores ranging from 1 (lowest priority or degree of concern) to 5 (highest priority or degree of 
concern) for each of six factors, assessing aspects of future vulnerability at the range-wide scale: 
Population Size (PS), Breeding Distribution (BD), Non-breeding Distribution (ND), Threats in 
the Breeding Season (TB), Threats in the Non-breeding season (TN), and Population Trend (PT) 
(Panjabi et al. 2005).  These factors are then used to calculate a Continental Combined Score 
   
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

What Sources of Information Did We Use?  

What Bird Species Did We Consider?

(CCS): PS + max(BD, ND) + max(TB, TN) + PT.  The threats scores and the distribution scores 
are highly correlated so PIF used this score rather than a simple total.  Thus, CCS ranges from 4 
for a widespread and increasing species which is expected to face even more favorable 
conditions in the future, to 20 for a species of the very highest future conservation concern.  The 
CCS was used to develop the landbird portion of the National BCC list. 
 
Partners in Flight also assesses species at the BCR level. That assessment includes two 
additional criteria, Relative Density (RD) and Percent of Population, which reflect the 
importance of a particular BCR to each species. The global scores for TB, TN, and PT are also 
adjusted using BCR-specific data.  These BCR scores informed the selection of landbirds for the 
BCC 2008 BCR lists. 
 
All of these factors are defined and discussed in detail in Panjabi et al. (2005).  Both PIF 
breeding and wintering (non-breeding) scores, where available, were used in assessing species 
for inclusion in the BCC 2008 report.  In consultation with experts, the USFWS prepared scores 
for landbirds of Hawaii and Pacific island territories using the PIF process. 
 
USSCP Assessment Scores.  For shorebird species, we started with the updated assessment 
scores from the USSCP (USSCP 2004), which were built on original plan assessments (Brown et 
al. 2000, Brown et al. 2001).  We incorporated new information on shorebird population trends 
and sizes published by Morrison et al. (2006) and Bart et al. (2007).  Information on population 
sizes were ranked according to the PIF criteria.  We also included updates in breeding and 
nonbreeding threats provided by regional shorebird working groups.  The USSCP assessment 
process uses most of the same factor scores (with slightly different criteria) as PIF, but priorities 
were derived using a categorical (rather than a summation) approach (Brown et al. 2001).  A 
prioritization protocol for shorebirds (in Brown et al. 2001) describes prioritization categories 
and their relationship to factor scores. 
 
NAWCP Assessment Scores.  Like USSCP, the NAWCP assessment process also uses most of 
the same factor scores (with slightly different criteria) as PIF and derives priorities using a 
categorical approach (Kushlan et al. 2002).  For all three scales used in the BCC, we referred to 
the continental-scale assessment results documented in the NAWCP plan (Kushlan et al. 2002) 
and subsequent analyses (i.e., for non-colonial waterbirds, documented at 
http://www.waterbirdconservation.org), which we considered to be the best available data for 
waterbirds and seabirds.  For BCC 2008 BCR lists, we also referred to assessments in regional 
waterbird conservation plans or documents that most closely resemble regional waterbird 
conservation plans, where available (see www.waterbirdconservation.org.)  These regional-scale 
status assessments are, in general, based on the continental-scale assessment, though regional 
planning groups made adjustments based on BCR-scale needs and values.

What Selection Criteria Did We Use For Birds of Conservation Concern 2008 Lists? 

 
The following are the criteria used to select species for consideration and inclusion on BCR, 
USFWS Region, and National lists.  At each scale, USFWS expertise and discretion refined the 
   
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

pool of species under consideration from the three bird conservation initiativesas well as those 
selected for priority liststo comply with the FWCA amendment of 1988.  The same criteria 
were used for all subspecies and populations considered separately for inclusion. 
 
There may be additions to the lists over the next several years.  Newly designated Federal 
candidate species, species proposed for listing, and species removed from the list of endangered 
and threatened species will automatically be considered to be on the appropriate BCC list(s), 
effective the day of their designation or delisting as published in the Federal Register. 
 
General criteria (rule-sets) for placing species on any BCC list 
 
1. Begin with list from appropriate bird conservation initiative. 
 
2. Follow criteria below for appropriate bird groups (see Panjabi et al. 2005 for explanation of 
terms). 
 
3. Add non-breeding species if the species occurs at significant Relative Density scores and/or 
has moderate or high threat levels (based on expert opinion or data) in non-breeding season, if 
not already included due to breeding population (indicate with nb). 
 
4. Consider subspecies and populations where appropriate and where information on their status 
is available (e.g., Dickinson 2003).  
 
5. Remove sport-hunted species (including their non-hunted populations) and federally-listed 
threatened or endangered populations (retaining non-listed populations with notation). 
 
6. Add any recently ESA de-listed, candidate, or proposed species not already included. 
 
7. In very limited circumstances, add or remove species (and document rationale) when Service 
expertise, supplemental information, or local data indicates a much greater or lesser degree of 
concern than that reflected by bird conservation initiative scoring.  
 
Criteria for placing species on BCR lists 
 
LANDBIRD criteria for BCR lists (see Panjabi 2005 for explanation of terms): 
 
1.   Include species meeting the PIF criteria for Species of Regional Importance  Continental   

Concern (U.S. and Canada), EXCEPT 

a)   if Regional Combined Score <15 and Action Code = Planning and Responsibility 

b)   in BCRs shared with Canada and Mexico, those with Relative Density >1 in the U.S. 

portion of the BCR (consult state population data). 

 

 

 

 
   
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

7

c)   for species shared with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), remove species with 

core ranges outside the U.S. and its territories if <1% of population or range-wide 
distribution is in the U.S. and threats in LAC are low. However, if conservation action for 
a species is warranted in the U.S. due to high threats in LAC, then it could be included in 
the appropriate U.S. BCR lists. 

 
2.   Include species meeting the PIF criteria for Species of Regional Importance  Regional 

Concern IF: 

Management 
 

 

 

a)   Regional Combined Score >15 and Action Code = Critical Recovery or Immediate 

b)   Regional Combined Score > 17 and Action Code = Management Attention 

 
3.   Rank species in Hawaii and Pacific island territories using latest PIF criteria and above 

criteria as appropriate. 

 
SHOREBIRD criteria for BCR lists: 
 
1.   Include all species, subspecies, and populations meeting criteria for National BCC List if 
>1% of taxon occurs anytime during annual cycle in the BCR (i.e., Relative Density >1 in 
the BCR). The criteria for National BCC List are: 

a)  population is undergoing a strong decline (Population Trend = 5), regardless of 

population size; OR 

b)  population is declining or stable (Population Trend = 4 or 3) and populations are small, 
distributions are limited and threats are high (Population Size + Breeding Distribution + 
Non-breeding Distribution + Threats to Breeding + Threats to Non-breeding  18). 

 
 
WATERBIRD criteria for BCR lists: 
 
1.   Initially identify species of greatest concern from each BCR using the regional waterbird 
conservation plans or similar documentation (e.g., Joint Venture implementation plans).  
Depending on BCR-scale approaches, include species regionally assessed as High or 
Highest/Highly Imperiled, as Tier I (if the PIF approach was used), or priority species for 
BCR-scale partnership. 
 

2.   Remove species from BCR lists if U.S. populations are considered unmanageable (e.g., 

Relative Density <1). 
 

3.   Identify and retain only those species of greatest conservation concern, as some regional-plan 

species lists were designed to maximize support for a wide range of conservation activities 
by partners or identify species around which partnerships could operate.  

   
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

8

1.  Include species from the BCC BCR lists if the species has the equivalent of a RD >1 or a 
manageable population in 50% or more of the BCRs in which it occurs within a USFWS 
region. 

 
Criteria for placing species on BCC National list 
 
LANDBIRD criteria for National list: 
 
1.  Include all PIF Continental Watchlist (which includes the U.S. and Canada) species and 

U.S. island territories species that meet PIF Continental Watchlist criteria EXCEPT,  

a)  species without manageable populations in the U.S. or its territories; however, if 

conservation action is warranted in the U.S. due to high threats elsewhere, then such 
species could be included; 
 

b)  species that are not listed on any BCC BCR list. 

 
 
SHOREBIRD criteria for National list: 
 
1.  Include species (or subspecies/population designations where supported by USSCP 

Conservation Assessment [2000] or more recent work) that meet any ONE of the following 
criteria: 

 

 

 
Criteria for placing species on USFWS Regional lists 
 

a)  population is undergoing a strong decline (Population Trend = 5), regardless of 

population size; OR 

b)  population is declining or unknown (Population Trend = 4 or 3) and populations are 

small, distributions are limited and threats are high (Population Size + Breeding 
Distribution + Non-breeding Distribution + Threats to Breeding + Threats to Non-
breeding  18). 

 
Scores have been revised and reflect the best science to date and are under review (Andres 
unpubl.). 
 
 
WATERBIRD criteria for National list: 
 
1.  Include species ranked Highly Imperiled in the NAWCP continental-scale assessment 

unless not occurring on any BCR list.  

 
2.  Consider all species ranked High in the NAWCP continental-scale assessment (unless not 
   
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

9

occurring on any BCR list) and include those with global population size (PS) factor score of 
5, 4, 3 or 2.  Populations at PS = 2 are included if they are at the lower end of the range in 
this category (i.e., 69,200) and experiencing steep declines. 

 

THE BIRDS OF CONSERVATION CONCERN 2008 LISTS 

 
To maximize the usefulness of this report to multiple partners, the BCC 2008 lists are presented 
in 46 separate tables, comprising 37 BCR lists (Tables 2 to 38), 8 USFWS Region lists (Tables 
39 to 47) and 1 National list (Table 48).  Summaries of the status of each species at each of the 
three distinct geographic scales are provided in Appendix B, and a list of scientific names of all 
species mentioned is found in Appendix C.  The BCR lists range from 10 to 53 species, USFWS 
Region lists range from 27 to 78 species, and the National list consists of 147 species.  The 
number of priority species represents roughly 10 to 15 percent of all bird species of any given 
geographic unit.   

 

BCR Lists 

 
The number of species on individual BCR lists (Tables 2 to 38) ranges from 10 to 53, averaging 
about 27.  Lists are generally larger for BCRs in the southern United States, reflecting greater 
species diversity at lower latitudes and the importance of these regions for wintering migrants.  
Island birds are at increased risk of becoming endangered.  Thus, the Other U.S. Pacific 
Islands BCR and U.S. Caribbean Islands BCR have relatively high proportions of their native 
species represented as birds of conservation concern.  Roughly ten percent of the bird species 
native to Hawaii (BCR 67) are identified as birds of conservation concern, but that region also 
has a disproportionately large number of bird species listed as either endangered or threatened 
under the ESA; combining birds of conservation concern with endangered or threatened species, 
about 25 percent of the native Hawaiian avifauna is at risk. 
 

USFWS Region Lists 

 
The number of species on individual USFWS Region lists (Tables 39 to 47) ranges from 27 to 
78, averaging about 50.  Following the trend seen in BCRs, USFWS Region lists of priority 
species are larger in the southern United States, although this is partially attributed by the 
disparities in area covered by each of the Regions.  The birds on the USFWS Region lists 
generally represent about 10 percent of the species native to the respective Regions. 
 
 

National List 

 
The National list (Table 48) is comprised of 147 species, and includes disproportionately larger 
numbers of species from the orders Procellariformes (albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, and 
storm-petrels), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, terns, and auks), and Piciformes 
(woodpeckers).  Within the Charadriiformes, the families Charadriidae (plovers), 
Haematopodidae (oystercatchers), Scolopacidae (sandpipers), and Alcidae (murres, murrelets, 
   
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 

10

and auklets) are represented on the list by greater numbers of species than expected.  Among the 
Passeriformesa large and diverse order of perching birdsthe families Parulidae (wood-
warblers) and Emberizidae (sparrows) and the subfamily Drepanidinae (Hawaiian 
honeycreepers) dominate the list in terms of both actual and relative numbers. 
 

DISCUSSION 

 
BCC 2008 is the latest update in a continuing effort to assess and prioritize bird species for 
conservation purposes (USFWS 1982, 1987, 1995, 2002; and U.S. Department of the Interior 
1990).  It is difficult to make meaningful comparisons among the lists because of differences in 
the way each succeeding report was prepared.  In chronological order, these previous lists 
contained 28, 30, 77, 124, and 131 species of conservation concern at a National scale in 1982, 
1987, 1990, 1995, and 2002 respectively; by comparison, BCC 2008 includes 147 species at the 
National scale.   
 
Do these figures reflect an actual decline in the conservation status of the Nation's birdlife, or do 
they merely reflect improvements in our ability to accurately identify and characterize species in 
real need of conservation attention?  The truth probably lies somewhere in between.  The 
preparation of prioritized species lists should be viewed as an evolving process, improving as our 
knowledge base increases, with each list reflecting the best available information at the time of 
its publication.  The three bird conservation initiatives update their own assessments and scoring 
as new data or analyses become available.  The data from these initiativeswhich form the basis 
of BCC 2008incorporate a great deal of input from many bird experts and have wide 
acceptance among members of avian conservation and scientific communities.  We are confident 
that the methods used in BCC 2008 are the best available for identifying avian conservation 
priorities as directed by the FWCA amendment of 1988. 
 
Of the 131 species on the BCC 2002 National list, 103 were retained on the current 2008 list and 
28 were deleted due to a lack of convincing evidence that continued elevated concern is 
warranted.  Forty-four species were added to the National list, resulting in a net gain of sixteen 
species for a current total of 147 species. 
 
Of the 211 species on the Audubon WatchList (Butcher et al. 2007) that are not also a) 
endangered or threatened or b) hunted, 106 are on the BCC 2008 National list and an additional 8 
are on USFWS Region or BCR lists. 
 
The selection criteria that we used identified 10 to 15 percent of all species at each geographic 
scale to be in need of additional conservation attention.  Nongame migratory birds protected by 
the MBTA, the primary focus of this effort, make up an overwhelming proportion of the species 
on the BCC 2008 lists.  However, the proportional representation of non-MBTA species 
increases progressively at larger scales, reflecting the vulnerability of the island-endemic species 
that form the bulk of this group.  The proportional representation of ESA candidate species also 
increases progressively at larger scales.  ESA-delisted and ESA-proposed species make up a 
progressively smaller proportion of the species at larger scales.

BCC 2008 can be used as a barometer of the condition of our countrys avifauna.  Although there 
are general patterns that can be inferred from this report, there is no single reason why any 
species was placed on any one of these lists; some are relatively common but are undergoing 
sharp declines in population numbers, others are rare but may actually be increasing in numbers 
in certain locations, and others may be both rare and declining.  However, habitat loss due to 
alteration or destruction continues to be the major reason for the declines of many species 
(Askins et al. 1990, USFWS 1995, Samson et al. 1998, Askins 2000).  Birds included in the BCC 
2008 lists are deemed priorities for conservation actions, and the lists will be consulted for 
actions taken on Federal lands in accordance with Executive Order 13186, Responsibilities of 
Federal agencies to protect migratory birds (Clinton 2001).  BCC species will also receive 
priority attention in the USFWS when allocating research, monitoring, and management funding. 
Our hope is that BCC 2008 will stimulate coordinated, collaborative proactive conservation 
actions among Federal, State, and private partners.
