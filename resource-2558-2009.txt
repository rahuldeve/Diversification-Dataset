Podocarpus National Park (PNP; 145,692 ha), established in 1982,
is  the  only  national  park  in  southern  Ecuador.  It  was  established
principally  to  protect  Andean  conifers,  Podocarpus  spp.  In  this
introduction,  first,  we  describe  the  methods  that  we  used  in  our
rapid appraisal of PNP. We detail our analytic perspective and the
problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method approach that we
used. Second, we briefly describe PNP and its context. Our account
of PNP management policy is a story about people who make up one
large social process regarding how PNP will be used and who gets to
decide.  Within  this  social  process,  people  are  seeking  values  (e.g.,
well-being, wealth, respect) by using existing institutions and call-
ing for new ones that use and affect resources in different ways. In
this  introduction  we  look  at  this  social  process,  the  idea  of  the
common  interest,  and  the  need  for  management  policy  to  help
meet this goal. We also look at development and conservation as a
decision-making  process  that  must  be  understood  and  managed
well if sustainability is to be had. The key to success in this regard,
we argue, is to link authority and control in PNP management

The  authors  want  to  thank  their  hosts  and  all  the  citizens  of  Ecuador  who  showed
hospitality, shared information, and allowed visits to their homes, business, and offices. To
all these people, too numerous to name individually, the authors thank them for providing
help, friendship, and opportunities to learn.

INTRODUCTION

Podocarpus National Park (PNP; 145,692 ha), now 23 years old, is the only
national park in southern Ecuador. PNP was established in 1982 principally
to protect the last large stands of Andean conifers (Podocarpus spp.) in this
region. The park includes cloud forests, small lakes, and lowland Amazon
forest.  Four  major  headwaters  flow  from  the  park,  providing  the  main
source of water for the two main cities in the region, Loja and Zamora, as
well  as  smaller  communities.  The  park  is  rich  in  biodiversity  and  species
endemism.  Established  by  an  Act  of  the  Ecuadorian  Parliament,  the  park
was created for sustainable development purposes (United States Agency
for  International  Development  [USAID], 2003).  This  protected  area  and  its
buffer zone have the potential to be motors of development, and an impor-
tant source of the goods and resources needed for the social and economic
welfare (Kakabadse, 2003, p. ix).

PNPs potential in this regard has not yet been realized, despite the hard
work of a great many dedicated people. An active discussion is underway at
present about development, environmental change, and poverty in the region,
and what to do about it. However, the region is a contested landscape domi-
nated  by  competing  discourses  (Brechin,  Wilshusen,  Fortwangler,  &  West,
2003). One discourse focuses on development and calls for expanded natural
resource exploitation and increased business opportunities. This discourse
largely supports the existing power process and privileges those in charge now.
The second discourse focuses on environmental degradation and calls for new
practices that minimize exploitation. This discourse largely supports the grow-
ing non-governmental environmental community and their allies in universities,
certain  government  agencies,  and  in  other  sectors  of  society.  It  supports  the
empowerment of new participants and their community-based practices, peo-
ple who are now largely outside of the dominant discourse.

Both  discourses  justify  their  proposed  formula/program  in  terms  of
helping  people  and  improving  lives,  but  in  fact  the  challenge  of  poverty
perplexes both discourses. In all this, the full human context is overlooked,
misconstrued, or discounted. In so doing, the problem of development and/
or conservation is reduced to largely a technical problem of engineering
(Brunner, 2004). One way out of this contested landscape, discourse com-
petition,  and  engineering  trap  is  to  use  effective  interdisciplinarity  to

make  sense  of  the  problem  of  environment  and  development  (Adams,
2001, p. 16). Such an approach is currently lacking in the PNP arena. How-
ever, the needed concepts and practical tools of interdisciplinism exist and
await application (see Clark, 2002). This volume encourages their use in the
PNP case and everywhere that similar challenges need attention.

In  this  introduction,  first,  we  describe  methods  that  we  used  in  our
rapid  appraisal  and  in  preparation  of  this  volume.  Second,  we  briefly
describe PNP and its context. We describe PNP management policy as really
a  story  about  people  who  make  up  one  large  social  process  regarding
how PNP will be used and who gets to decide. We also look at the idea of
common interest and the need for management policy in PNP that helps
people to find common ground. Common ground in development and con-
servation  will  only  come  about  if  an  effective  decision-making  process  is
put in place and carefully lead and managed. The kind of decision-making
process and functional standards needed are introduced. Third, in this intro-
duction  we  also  give  an  overview  of  the  articles  in this  volume and  how
they support this common interest outcome that can secure a healthy future
for the people in and around PNP.

METHODS IN RAPID ASSESSMENT

We were invited by The Nature Conservancy, Ecuador to conduct a rapid
assessment  of  management  policy  in  PNP,  and  hosted  by  ArcoIris.  Both
organizations actively work in the PNP region. We were asked to offer our
perspective  and  see  if  we  could  help  with  the  natural  resources  manage-
ment and policy challenges that they and the people of Ecuador face. We
spent  10  days  in  the  field  visiting  numerous  sites  and  organizations,  and
talking with over 50 people. We observed projects focused on water, forests,
pastures,  fires,  grazing,  logging,  mining,  orchid  and  wildlife  poaching,  road
building and construction, tourism, subsistence farming, small-scale agriculture,
reforestation, bird conservation, ecological research, program administration,
coordination, and leadership. These experiences grounded us thoroughly in
PNP and in the buffer zone in practical ways. This volume reports on our
visit to Ecuador, March 1019, 2005.

The Yale Rapid Assessment Course

For the last 10 years at Yale Universitys School of Forestry and Environmental
Studies, our course on Rapid Appraisal in Forest Productivity and Biodiversity
Conservation  has  taken  us  to  Mexico,  Belize,  Venezuela,  Panama,  Costa
Rica,  and  Ecuador  at  the  invitation  of  in-country  hosts.  Reports  of  these
assessments  are  in  Clark,  Tuxill,  and  Ashton,  2003;  Clark,  Ziegelmayer,
Ashton,  and  Newcomer,  2004; and Clark, Ashton, Dixon, and Petit, 2006.

S. G. Clark et al.

We prepare a peer-reviewed report, like this one, for the Journal of Sustain-
able  Forestry,  our  hosts,  other  people  in-country,  and  the  wider  interna-
tional community. Our last published report in 2004 was from the Condor
BioReserve  in  northern  Ecuador  (Clark  et  al.,  2004).  All  of  these  earlier
reports serve as background for this one. In these earlier rapid assessments,
we have looked at municipalities, communities, decentralization, ecological
reserve and park management, issues of representation in decision making,
biodiversity,  watersheds,  incentive  systems,  strategies  for  protected  area
management, spectacled bears and other featured species, non-timber forest
products, environmental education, silvopastoral practices, decision making,
and many other topics. We offered practical recommendations in each case.
The  course  is  divided  into  three  parts:  pre-field  trip  assessment  and
preparation, the rapid assessment itself, and post-field trip and report writing.
Detailed accounts of our rapid assessment approach are in Clark and Ashton
(1999, 2004). These trips are problem oriented, contextual, and multimethod
(Clark, Willard,  & Cromley,  2000).  In the pre-field trip phase, we prepare
ourselves through reading, discussion, and planning. While in country, we
gather  considerable  written  material  and  conduct  as  many  interviews  as
time allows. The trip itinerary is largely set by our hosts, in this case, The
Nature Conservancy and ArcoIris. However, we have adjusted the schedule
as opportunity dictated. Several class members are native Spanish speakers
and others are fluent in Spanish. All these materials, observations, and inter-
views are used in our reports.

2005 Rapid Assessment to PNP

The 2005 course had 12 students. The students were well-experienced, both
internationally and across a wide range of subjects and tasks. In our group
we had four native Spanish speakers from Costa Rica, Peru, and Uruguay;
six  American  students  who  had  lived,  worked,  or  visited  Latin  America
before and were fluent or partially so in Spanish; and only two members
with  minimal  knowledge  of  Spanish.  Our  hosts  knew  English,  in  many
cases, so conversations were ongoing, in-depth, and substantive.

Our approach and intent was to understand and help address complex
problems of sustainability and development. Students chose topics that were
important to Ecuadorians and ones with which they had some experience. We
looked at how to balance the many interests involved in PNP management.
There are many issues at playdecentralization versus centralization, issues
of  participation  (experts,  officials,  citizens,  businesses,  and  others),  and
issues of governance and decision making. Presently, attention in the PNP
arena is focused on biodiversity, water, private lands, buffer zone, private
land management, forests, soils, education, markets/businesses, agriculture,
and much more. We were introduced to many of these issues, and sought
to understand as many as the time permitted. In this volume, we work to

bridge the gulfs between development and environmentalism, and between
academia and real world decision making, in the context of PNP.

We visited and/or spoke with people at Catamayo, Salado, near Jimura,
Andaluza,  Bosque  de  Hanne,  Fundacion  Jocotoco,  Tapichalaca  Reserve,
Cajanuma park station, the herbarium at the Universidad Nacional de Loja
and UNL forestry program, ArcoIris, Nature & Culture International, Estacion
Biologica  San  Francisco,  Ministry  of  Environment,  PNP  park  director,  and
Loja municipality officials. We visited local communities and spoke with a
campesino organization, among our many stops in the region. We also went to
Quito and spoke with The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International.
We  visited  libraries,  museums,  and  other  repositories  of  information.  We  lis-
tened to numerous presentations and spoke with people in formal and informal
situations. Conversations occurred in group settings and between individuals.
Some conversations were brief, others extended over hours and days. Post-field
trip analysis and writing was intensive and took about 6 months.

Sustainable Development and Conservation

We are interested in the discourses of sustainability, development, and con-
servation  in  practical  ways.  These  are  not  disembodied  constructs.  They
have real consequences and are used to direct policy and management that
affects peoples lives. What does the term sustainable development mean,
and what is its power to draw diverse people in support? The term is widely
used today in many fields as a goal and as a way to justify favored interven-
tions  purported  to  make  peoples  lives  better  and  use  natural  resources  in
ways  that  do  not  destroy  them.  The  idea  behind  sustainable  develope-
ment  has  potential  to  dissolve  the  boundaries  of  disciplines,  practices,
and ideologies. Adams (2001, p. 4) explains that the term is simultaneously
both superficially simple and yet capable of carrying a wide range of mean-
ings  and  supporting  sometimes  divergent  interpretations.  The  Brundtland
Commission has offered the dominant definition of sustainable development:
development  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  present  without  compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (Brundtland, 1987,
p. 43). This definition, however, functions more as a slogan than a serious
theory or practical program for action. Neither development nor conservation
has  precise  meanings.  Mirovitskaya  and  Ascher  (2001,  p.  12)  state  that
development is the increased capability in the pursuit of wealth, well-being,
or other values, and conservation is both classic elements of nature protec-
tion  and  preservation,  such  as  restoration  and  safeguarding  of  ecological
processes and genetic diversity, as well as management of natural resources
and  ecosystems  to  ensure  their  sustainable  use  (Mirovitskaya  &  Ascher;
p. 47).  However,  as  Adams  (p.  383)  notes,  sustainable  development  is
only  the  beginning  of  a  processa  social  and  decision  process.  It  is  a
statement of intent, not a route-map.

S. G. Clark et al.

This  volume  argues  for  fundamentally  rethinking  the  concept  of  sus-
tainable  development.  At  present,  people  pushing  for  development  often
conflict  directly  with  people  promoting  conservation.  Often  the  way  both
groups  conceive  of  sustainable  development  is  practically  limited  and
causes  competition  and  conflict.  A  larger,  more  inclusive  concept  is
neededone that permits integrated problem solving by finding common
ground.  This  requires  moving  beyond  technical  conceptions  of  either
development  or  conservation  and  engineering  to  more  pragmatic  and
humanistic understanding and actions. As Adams (2001, p. xviii) notes,

The world is not a machine, to be run by privileged super-mechanics,
however  skilled  in  environmental  housekeeping.  Rather  than  simply
contributing to the enhanced efficiency of centralized bureaucratic and
technocratic power, green development must also address the capacity
of individuals and groups to plan and run their own lives, and control
their own environments.

For this view to fully replace the present dominant engineering view,
a  reconstituting  of  the  way  many  people  and  organizations  operate  is
required. This volume supports such a reconstitution and suggests ways that
both ordinary management decision making and constitutive decision making
can be improved in the common interest.

PODOCARPUS NATIONAL PARK MANAGEMENT POLICY 

AND ITS CONTEXT

There are many problematic aspects to the management policy of PNP. The
key to successful management policy is to understand the context and work
within it to achieve the goals of sustainable development and conservation.
The  following  introduces  a  method  to  map  the  context,  and  a  problem-
oriented  technique  to  identify  problems  and  find  practical  strategies  for
management. Many people limit their mapping of the context to biophysical
or environmental aspects, economics, or some other part of the region; and in
so  doing  minimize,  overlook,  or  misconstrue  human  context  dynamics.
These  errors  result  in  misperceptions,  judgments,  and  misguided  recom-
mendations. The approach we take focuses on humans and their interac-
tions and the environmental (biophysical) setting in which people live and
interact  using  genuinely  interdisciplinary  concepts  and  tools  (Lasswell  &
McDougal, 1992). We are problem oriented and multimethod in our con-
textual examination of PNPs actual problems. The approach this volume
takes focuses both on the human social process dynamic that determines
the fate of PNP and also focuses on the regions resources, both natural
and human.

Introduction

Human Social ProcessThe Context

There are many ways to understand PNP management policy and its develop-
ment and conservation challenges. Some ways are biological and technical,
and others focus on human social interaction. These understandings are not
mutually  exclusive,  even  though  they  are  typically  addressed  indepen-
dently. The technical focus directs our attention to features such as species
and ecosystem diversity, water quality, and other structural and functional
parts  of  the  ecosystem  or  landscape.  The  human  social  focus  directs  our
attention to the way people organize themselves for a common purpose or
for  conflict  and  competition  with  one  another.  This  volume  appreciates
both  emphases  and  seeks  to  move  beyond  these  two  approaches.  At  its
base,  management  policy  is  the  human  social  process  that  decides  if  and
how PNP will be managed and used (Clark et al., 2000). It is the social pro-
cess that determines who will make important decisions about the future of
the park and buffer zone, as well as who benefits and who is harmed by the
resource  use  patterns  adopted.  Understanding  social  process  is  critical  to
managing  PNP  successfully.  Empirically-based  methods  to  map  this  social
process or context are required. For actual problem solving, both the tech-
nical and social dimensions need to be carefully integrated using concepts
designed specifically to do so.

PNP can be thought of as a human arena of recent construction. Gov-
ernment officials formally established it with their authority at the national
level.  Prior  to  that,  the  university  and  environmental  communities
researched the region and effectively promoted the PNP idea to the public
and government officials, domestically and internationally. The way that this
arena or situation is organized todaywho participates, with what perspec-
tives  and  values,  using  which  strategies,  and  seeking  what  outcomes
determines how PNP management policy is unfolding and what is possible in
the future. This contextual view of management policy focuses our attention
on  social  featuresparticipants,  perspectives,  situation  (or  arena),  values,
strategies, outcomes, and effects. This is the social process as described by
Lasswell  and  McDougal  (1992).  These  variables  can  be  researched,
described, and managed in varying degrees to bring about sustainable devel-
opment and conservation. This contextual way of viewing PNP management
and  the  human  dynamic  involved  differs  dramatically  from  that  taken  by
people  using  only  a  biological  and  technical  standpoint  and  methods.  The
two approachestechnical and socialto understanding PNP management
policy  are  mutually  compatible  if  dealt  with  through  concepts  that  foster
interdisciplinarity. At present in the PNP arena, beginning efforts are under-
way and much potential exists to capitalize ways and means for integration.
What  is  the  social  process  or  context  of  PNP?  Stated  most  generally,
people  in  the  PNP  arena  are  striving  to  maximize  personal  values  (e.g.,
well-being, wealth, skill, respect, and others) by using existing institutions

(e.g., markets, power arrangements, associations) to get and use resources
(both natural and human resources). At the risk of sounding too general or
abstract at this point in this volume, this PNP social process is outlined in
Table 1. Our task in rapid assessment was to empirically detail this process
using data to the maximum extent that we could through our research (see
the chapter on context and the human social process by Clark et al., as well as
the chapter on the PNP arena and decision-making context by Cherney et al.
in this volume).

Understanding this human social process at the heart of PNP manage-
ment policy is key to meeting Ecuadorian peoples and the parks common
interest goals (goals are listed and discussed in the article on problem orien-
tation, Clark et al., this volume). At present little published data on this basic
human process exists for PNP. Such information on how the social process
operates in the region would be invaluable if it were available to all parties.
This information could be gathered, shared among interested people, espe-
cially  officials,  and  used  to  advantage  by  all  parties  to  create  a  situation
where  those  who  have  authority  work  productively  with  those  who  have
control of resources, in the common interest. Getting and using this kind of
contextual knowledge practically and responsibly could greatly improve all
aspects of PNP management policy.

In the final analysis, successful management, functionally speaking, is
about people seeking values through institutions using resources. To date,

This  Process  Understanding  can  then  be  Used  to  Guide  Programs  for  Sustainable
Development and Conservation

People

With perspectives (people have identifications, make demands, and hold expectations) as 
well as beliefs (myths) based on a doctrine (ideology), formula (norms), and symbols that 
represent beliefs that guide how they behave and their value outlook.

Seek Values

Such as: power, respect, enlightenment, wealth, well-being, rectitude, skill, and affection 
that can improve their lives and bring security.

Using Institutions

Through techniques (e.g., based on the values of skill, power, knowledge, and so on) to 
affect organizational routines of government, parties, pressure groups, private 
associations, and even non-organized settings so that they get resources and can use them 
to improve their lives and bring security.

To Get and Use Resources

Such as unprocessed land, water, air, soils, plants, and animals, as well as processed land 
and human facilities and human energy to shape and distribute all value processes such 
as: power, respect, enlightenment, wealth, well-being, rectitude, skill, affection among 
people with different perspectives and beliefs; thus, new institutions are created and these 
may be sustained.

this  social  process  in  PNP  remains  limited  in  its  effectiveness  to  achieve
public  interest  goals.  However,  much  potential  exists  to  overcome  past
omissions. Methods to learn about human social process in the PNP arena
exist and are partly introduced in this volume (see also Clark, 1997). The
social  process  of  Ecuador  has  been  examined  previously  in  Clark  and
Padwe  (2004).  These  authors  recommended  that  (a)  analysis  of  existing
experience within Ecuador, (b) use of the problem-solving framework that
they  proposed  (the  same  one  used  in  this  volume),  and  (c)  widespread
diffusion  of  this  knowledge  to  all  participants,  will  help  managers  and
policymakers  in  their  efforts  to  find  the  common  interest  and  promote
sustainable development and conservation.

At  present,  most  attention  in  PNP  seems  to  be  within  the  resources
category (e.g., water, forests, biodiversity). There is a dramatic, systematic,
and explicit lack of attention to people, values, and institutions (Table 1).
Gains could be made in PNP management policy if more attention were put
into these three categoriespeople, values, and institutions. The following
is just one way to think about how to better link people, values, and institu-
tions for gains in PNP.

Common Interest in Theory and Practice

We understand common interest to evolve from a democratic process that
is open, reliable, fair, factual, honest, and reflects the interests of the majority
of people affected by decisions of import. In the PNP arena, the common
interest can only come about if the social process described above functions
well,  according  to  these  and  other  standards  (see  Lasswell  &  McDougal,
1992;  Brunner,  2002).  The  PNP  management  process  is  a  distinctively
human  one  through  which  participants  share  their  particular  perspectives
and  attempt  though  interaction  to  identify  areas  of  overlap  and  arrive  at
some consensus that is both authoritative and controlling. The prescription
or norms thus set are to be followed and enforced by all citizens. This is the
path to sustainability.

The social process and its target of sustainable development and con-
servation in the PNP arena is a noble human concern, but it is vulnerable to
less-than-noble  human  traits  such  as  aggressive  competition,  destructive
practices, and dogmatisms. This can lead to special interest domination of
what should otherwise be a common interest process. Special interests are
at play in many aspect of the PNP management policy process under way.
Special interests are those of a minority that harm the majority. In principle,
the legislation that formed PNP is a working specification of the common
interests that has yet to be achieved on the ground in the PNP arena. It is
this  struggle between  participants seeking common versus  special  interest
outcomes that is the focus of the human social process today. These partici-
pants and their interests may be principled if they are well justified (based

on  fairness),  expedient  when  used  to  get  ones  way  (keeps  status  quo  in
place),  assumed  when  little  or  no  evidence  supports  them  (imaginary,
presumed to be in the common interest), or scientifically valid when evidence
supports them (real; McDougal, Lasswell, & Reisman, 1981). The present PNP
arena  and  social  process  shows  all  these  kinds  of  interests  in  competition.
This  is  what  was  meant  above  regarding  PNPs  contested  landscape  and
competing discourses.

At present, social process data shows that people in the PNP arena are
having  difficulty  finding,  securing,  and  sustaining  their  common  interest.
New ways for people to interact are needed (e.g., community-based initia-
tives, new markets, etc.). The PNP arena is not currently well organized to
facilitate easy construction of new processes for finding common ground. In
fact, the arena and human social process presently works against finding,
securing, and sustaining common interest outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a
great potential and opportunity to improve matters.

Linking Authority and Control

Perhaps the major functional barrier to progress toward finding the common
interest  is  the  obvious  disconnect  between  those  people  with  authority
and  those  with  control.  What  are  authority  and  control,  functionally
speaking?  Authority  is  about  who  has  the  right  to  make  decisions  and
enforce them. Authority is about expectations, including assumptions about
whom  (selected  in  a certain way,  and  using his  control in  a  certain  way)
will be regarded as justified in what he does (Lasswell, 1971). For example,
the PNP Director has authority because it is expected that he alone is autho-
rized to make decisions about park management. In contrast, a citizen on
the street does not have authority to make decisions about park manage-
ment.  Having  authority  exerts  some  degree  of  control,  however  minor  it
may be. Control  is having the resources to enforce decisions. This means
having  base  valuesmoney,  skill,  knowledge,  and  so  onto  control
people and other resources. Control is needed to enforce compliance with
authorized policy. For example, the ban on orchid poaching in PNP is only
as good as the authority, and especially the control, behind it. If the park
can  fully  enforce  sanctions,  then  orchid  conservation  becomes  possible.
Control is needed to enforce both mild and severe sanctions. Currently, in
the  PNP  arena,  authorities  have little  control  (few resources  to  enforce
the  rules  or  norms  and  follow  through  with  effective,  on-the-ground
management). Clearly the institutions of public order, in this case PNP,
need  to  be  strengthened,  including  giving  the  park  more  resources.
However, these resources must be applied directly in support of common
interest  process  (not  private,  special  interest  processes).  When  public
resources are siphoned off in support of private ventures, this is corruption
(Reisman, 1979).

Introduction

607

For the PNP sustainable development and conservation effort (arena and
social and decision process) to function well in common interest, those with
authority must work closely with those with control and vice versa. There are
only  three  possible  combinations  of  authority  and  control:  authority  domi-
nates and is little connected to control, authority and control are connected in
an  effective  system  of  public  order,  or  control  dominates  and  is  little  con-
nected to authority (Table 2). In the PNP arena, government has authority but
little  control.  For  example,  the  Park  Director  told  us,  We  do  not  have  the
resources to actively enforce our border. He went on to make many other
references to the need for control (resources). In terms of money, he stated
that the operational budget for the park was US$48,000. In terms of enforce-
ment capacity, he stated that the seven park rangers under his control were
inadequate to police the park. The director calculated that he would need a
staff of 30  individuals and  US$300,000 for proper  management. Clearly, his
control is very limited despite his authority. In contrast, many environmental
non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  have  relatively  more  resources  in
terms  of  money,  knowledge,  and  skill  than  the  park.  These  NGOs  made
many references to the need for more authority. Such groups, however, do
have considerable control because of their money, knowledge, and skill.

While authority and control can be connected through a collaborative
effort, PNP official management, the environmental NGO community, and
others  (e.g.,  business,  local  associations,  other  government  agencies,  etc.)
do  not  work  as  closely  with  each  other.  Furthermore,  some  citizens  and
businesses are not following the law behind PNP as they mine, log forests,
illegally poach orchids and wildlife, and so on. For the law that guides PNP
management and its effective implementation to come about, authority and
control must be integrated into a practical program. The conflicting social
process  underway  at  present  is  about  different  participants  with  different
amounts of authority and control competing for influence or dominance.

The best way to bring about needed new patterns of interaction and new
institutions is through practice-based learning projects (see Brunner & Clark,
1997; this volume, especially Cherney et al.s Understanding Patterns). Prac-
tice-based projects are ones that take on actual management problems, not
theoretical ones. Interventions seek on-the-ground improvements in manage-
ment. Practice-based projects are at a human scale and produce results that
are easily observable. They can be diffused and replicated or adapted, if they
are successful, as needed to other people and new areas. This is a proven
means for innovation, learning, and improvement (Brunner, 2002).

TABLE  2 Authority  and  Control  Must  be  Interlinked  and  Mutually  Reinforcing  for
Podocarpus National Park Management Policy to be Effective and Serve the Common Interest
by Meeting Sustainable Development and Conservation Goals

Authority dominates, little 
connected to control

Problem: At present, 

government and officials 
have authority, but few 
resources for control 
outcomes. Arenas are 
established that exclude 
participants with control. 
The opportunity to 
combine authority and 
control to find the 
common interest is limited.

Example: The director of 

Podocarpus National Park 
has been designated the 
central authority figure of 
the park by the Ecuadorian 
government. He is 
recognized as being 
responsible for managing 
the park, although he lacks 
the resources (financial, 
human, infrastructure, etc.) 
to adequately control 
outcomes on the ground.

An effective system of public 
order for PNP, authority and 

control connected

Problem: At present, there 
are not enough instances 
where authority and 
control are combined to 
produce effective 
decision-making 
processes. Where they are 
combined, management 
policy works relatively 
well.

Example: In most instances, 
regional law enforcement 
agencies are recognized 
by the broad public as 
having the right to enforce 
the laws of Ecuador. They 
also have the ability to 
actually enforce the laws 
on the ground (power to 
arrest and write citation).

Control dominates, little 
connected to authority

Problem: At present, citizens, 

associations, and non-
governmental organizations 
(environmental groups and 
universities) have relatively 
more resources than 
government to use to 
control outcomes. This 
control is not effectively 
combined with participants 
with authority.

Example: International NGOs, 

such as The Nature 
Conservancy and 
Conservation International, 
have substantial more 
resources than local groups 
and government agencies. 
The control over these 
resources gives them 
disproportionate control 
over outcomes on the 
ground, although the broad 
community does not 
recognize the NGOs 
authority.

Solution: Those with 

Solution: Continue to use 

Solution: Those with control 

authority should join 
forces with those people 
and organizations that do 
have resources for control.

Introduction

609

This introduction gives a basic outline of the management policy challenges
in the PNP region. It is followed by two papers in Section 1 that serve as
a foundation of knowledge in understanding rapid assessments and how
intelligencethe  process  of  collecting,  analyzing,  and  disseminating
informationcan be used in helping achieve sustainability. Section 2 consists
of 11 case studies examining different aspects of PNP management policy.
Each provides recommendations on how to improve management.

The  first  three  case  studies  illustrate  methods  we  used  to  understand
management  policy  in  the  region.  In  the  problem-oriented  overview  by
Clark et al., the authors explain the policy sciences analytic tool of problem
orientation, and explore the biophysical, social, and decision-making chal-
lenges of the region. The second case study, by the same authors, clarifies
how  to  create  a  social  process  map;  and  creates  an  initial  map  of  PNPs
participants,  perspectives,  situations,  values,  strategies,  outcomes,  and
effects. These elements make up the context of PNP. The third case study,
by Cherney et al., further investigates the situation category of the social
process map. The authors explain how to understand arenassituations of
participant interactionand an arenas relation to the decision process.

The next four articles directly address the sustainability of conservation
and development efforts mediated by governmental and non-governmental
programs in the region. Andrea E. Johnson explains how the patterns and
processes by which money flows around the protected area are critical to the
regions long-term sustainability. Rafael Bernardi de Leon offers an assessment
of regional road development. He describes the tension between improving
infrastructure  for  development  goals  and  halting  infrastructure  construction
for conservation goals. He focuses on reducing the impacts of roads, while
meeting  development  needs.  Alvaro  Redondo-Brenes  article  looks  at  the
Pro-Cuencas  Water  Fund,  a  region  payment  initiative  for  environmental
services for watershed conservation. His analysis looks at how to improve
stakeholder  participation  to  improve  the  Funds  implementation.  Cesar
Moran-Cahusac  investigates  the  status  of  ecotourism  in  PNP,  and  how  it
relates to the development goals of the Ministry of Tourism and the conser-
vation goals of the Ministry of the Environment. His work concentrates on
creating an inclusive ecotourism product for the park.

The following four articles address forest conservation in PNP, and the
surrounding region. Cuoco and Cronan look at orchids as non-timber forest
products. They focus on developing orchids as an international commodity to
create economic benefits, while maintaining the viability of these rare and often
endemic  flower  populations.  Two  complementary  articles,  Alice  C.  Bonds
Contextual  Analysis  of  Agroforestry  Adoption  .  .  .  and  Kim  M.  Wilkinsons
Agroforestry Systems and Podocarpus National Park . . ., look at the possi-
bility of sustainable agriculture in order to reduce pressure on the regions
forests. Bond explores the social and decision-making context for agrofor-
estry,  emphasizing  institutional  reforms;  whereas  Wilkinson  investigates

how  traditional,  indigenous,  and  modern  agroforestry  practices  can  be
integrated to reduce land extensification. Maura L. Adams continues the
discussion  of  land  extensification  and  intensification  by  looking  at
regional cattle ranching practices. She evaluates the economic prospect of
intensification  as  an  alternative  to  the  environmentally  harmful  practice
of extensification.

Section  3  of  this  volume  is  a  synthesis  of  the  management  policy
challenges identified in the case studies. It identifies three major, func-
tional  challengesauthority  and  control,  the  instability  of  institutions,
and arenasas the major factors leading to suboptimal management policy
of  PNP  and  its  context.  This  article,  in  keeping  with  the  complete  vol-
ume, encourages efforts to develop management policy in the common
interest.

RECOMMENDATIONS

For Podocarpus National Park and the surrounding region to meet the goal
of  sustainable  development  and  conservation  in  the  common  interest,
changes are needed in the current management policy dynamic. The recom-
mendations  offered  in  this  volume  to  aid  the  present  management  policy
process are directed at (a) developing a larger understanding of what PNPs
management  policy  process  actually  is,  (b)  clarifying  what  is  at  stake  in
terms of values and the common interest, and (c) working to link authority
and  control  in  ways  that  promote  common  interest  processes  and  out-
comes. It is easy to justify these recommendations because they are sup-
ported by the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and many other international, national, and local conventions and policies.
Our  recommendations  can  be  achieved  by  reallocating  the  limited
resources  available  and  by  gaining  new  resources  from  ecotourism  and
other  profitable  means,  the  national  government,  and  the  international
community.

Management Policy

The  cases  in  this  volume  demonstrate  that  to  date,  the  understanding  of
PNPs  management  policy  is  limited  in  scope  and  consequently  needed
actions. Most organizations and individuals in the region focus on the limited
supply of tangible resources (e.g., money) and the unequal distribution of
power.  However,  management  policy  is  about  more  than  finances  and
political  clout.  Management  policy  is  a  human  social  process  in  which
people seeking values work through institutions to get and use resources.
This  is  a  value-laden  process  where  technical  solutions  are  unlikely  to
achieve an acceptable outcome in the broad public interest. Developing a

larger understanding of management policy process will allow more creative
and flexible options to address current and growing management challenges.
While this entire volume is focused on increasing the understanding of PNPs
management  policy  process,  Clark  et  al.s  articles  on  problem  orientation
and social process and Cherney et al.s article on understanding patterns,
introduce an analytic framework designed to systematically increase process
understanding and insight of the policy process with an eye toward making
practical improvements.

The Common Interest

Ensuring an effective policy process requires clarifying what is at stake in
terms of values and the common interest. Currently in the region, the com-
mon interest is not well defined. Instead, we see multiple competing claims
about  what  is  in  the  public  interest.  We  suggest  that  innovative  policy
alternatives can create a process that allows diverse individuals and orga-
nizations to find common ground. We acknowledge that identifying the
common  interest  is  rarely  a  straightforward  task.  However,  it  is  usually
apparent to most people what is not in the broad public interest. When
attempting  to  identify  what  is  or  is  not  in  the  public  interest,  Brunner
(2002, pp. 1214) suggests a three-part partial test: procedural, substan-
tive,  and  practical  tests.  The  procedural  test  asks  a  two-part  question:
(a) Is the process inclusive in representing a broad range of perspectives,
and (b) are the participants involved willing to be held accountable for
their  actions?  The  substantive  test  asks  if  participants  expectations  are
supported  by  the  best  available  evidence.  The  practical  test  asks  if  the
process meets the expectations of all participants. All proposed solutions
to  PNPs  management  policy  challenges  should  be  subjected  to  these
three tests.

Authority and Control

We suggest linking authority and control in ways that promote common
interest processes and outcomes. This means improving the human social
process so that people get the values they want through functioning insti-
tutions, and get and use resources in ways that support a successful PNP.
This  can  be  done  by  seeking  new  patterns  of  cooperation  and  co-
management  schemes.  This  requires  creating  new  arenas  and  decision-
making processes. Individuals and organizations that are authority figures
in  the  region  (e.g.,  the  director  of  PNP)  can  develop  partnerships  with
individuals and organizations that have control (e.g., NGOs, local people).
This should be done in such a way that passes the three-part test for com-
mon interest.

CONCLUSIONS

Podocarpus National Park is one of the worlds unique ecosystems. Its high
levels of endemism and species diversity justify goals of sustainable devel-
opment and conservation. However, the park and surrounding region are
also situated in a unique social and decision- making context. It is not the
natural raw resources, but rather the people in the region, that will deter-
mine  its  fate.  Ensuring  effective  conservation  and  development  requires  a
process by which people can clarify and secure their common interests. If this
is  not  done,  then  resources  will  be  wasted,  people  will  remain  in  poverty,
and time and opportunity will be lost. This volume offers new concepts and
practical alternatives in support of a sustainable future for the region. These
recommendations are not prescriptive in a narrow normal sense. They do
not advocate for any particular special interest. They are broad suggestions
to help the larger regional community find common ground by identifying,
clarifying, and securing their common interests.
