Notable Discoveries
Biodiversity Discovery has revealed amazing things, and it 
hasnt been just scientists who make these discoveries. 
Kids and volunteers also have collected plants and 
animals that turn out to be rare, new to a park, or some-
times even new to science. These discoveries improve our 
understanding of species requirements, ecosystem func-
tioning, and related stewardship activities.

  Rare species in common places: At Yosemite National 

Park, scientists are just beginning to explore a vast system 
of caves under their more-well-known towering walls of 
granite. While they expected discoveries in less disturbed 
caves, a new species of pseudoscorpion (Parabosum 
yosemite) was found in a cave that thousands of people 
visit every year.

  Silent invasions: During Yellowstone National Parks first 

BioBlitz in 2009, five species of earthworm were discov-
ered in undisturbed, backcountry areas. Every one was a 
European invasive species. Non-native earthworms can 
cause significant damage to soil ecosystems, and no one 
knows how badly invaded national park lands may be. 
Before the BioBlitz, the merits of earthworms were pri-
marily debated by anglers rather than resource managers. 

  Most common but least studied: As part of Big Thicket 

National Preserves Thicket of Discovery ATBI, two new 
species of trematodes were discovered, Lissorchis amnicu-
lensi and Caecincola autumnae, which are both fish para-
sites. Parasitism is probably the least understood way of 
life on the planet, but ironically it is also the most 

common, represented in about 70% of the worlds taxa. 
Parasitic worms can teach us about host animal diversity, 
abundance, and food web interactions.

  Some discoveries take time: After years of biodiversity 

activities at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a new 
pattern of life emerged there. Unlike the parks plants, 
diversity of some of the most numerous and species-rich 
groups of life (insects and spiders) appears to level off or 
increase above mid-elevations. This means a much greater 
percentage of the parks natural biodiversity may be at risk 
to being displaced upwards and squeezed off mountain 
peaks by temperature increases than park staff originally 
surmised.

  Park surveys contribute to national efforts: Congaree 

National Park has hosted annual Butterfly Counts over the 
last 14 years. More than 170 citizen scientists have docu-
mented almost 3,800 specimens, representing 138 
Lepidoptera species. Data are entered and reported 
though the North American Butterfly Association national 
database. Consistent data from across North America are 
necessary to reveal climate-related trends and patterns.

Biodiversity Discovery

A Foundation for Resource Protection and Stewardship
The National Park Service is charged 
with protecting the diversity of living 
organisms (i.e., biodiversity) found 
within its lands. Yet, as the National 
Park Service nears its second century, 
it has been estimated that as many as 
8090 percent of species in parks are 
undiscovered.

from emerging threatssuch as 
climate change, invasive plants and 
animals, disease, and human popula-
tion pressuresor to keep ecosystems 
intact.

To help address this gap, the National 
Park Service is undertaking a new 
effort, Biodiversity Discovery, to both 
document the diversity of life in parks 
and ensure the future of park scien-

tific study by engaging the next gener-
ation of scientists, educators, and 
park supporters.

Investing in Biodiversity Discovery 
activities at multiple scales will be 
invaluable to the future of our parks. 
By combining solid science and public 
passion and interest, we can help 
ensure preservation of our living 
resources.

This gap in knowledge makes it 
impossible to protect living resources

Building a Scientific Foundation for 
Management Decisions
Biodiversity Discovery refers to a variety 
of efforts to discover and document our 
natural heritage. These range from 
multi-decadal All Taxa Biodiversity 
Inventories (ATBIs) that aim to docu-
ment all species in a geographic area to 
BioBlitzes that search for species within 
a given time frame.

enables parks to proactively manage 
threats such as invasive species and 
overuse. 

As pressures on parks increase, knowl-
edge gained from Biodiversity Discovery 
efforts provide a foundation upon 
which parks can build sound, long-term 
plans for preservation.

Biodiversity Discovery often focuses on 
smaller life forms, such as insects, fungi, 
bacteria, and other little-studied groups 
that we are beginning to understand as 
key to ecosystem integrity and resil-
ience. 

These activities complement NPS 
inventory and monitoring by expanding 
our knowledge about park reference 
conditions.

This information serves as crucial base-
line data to compare the variety and dis-
tribution of living things as tempera-
tures, precipitation, pollution, and other 
large-scale patterns change. It also

Fostering Public Passion for Science in Parks
Because Biodiversity Discovery events 
often require excited minds and willing 
hands, but not a degree in science, they 
appeal to kids and non-scientists of all 
ages as much as they do to PhDs. 

Also, because these events allow a 
person to jump right into the exciting 
part of science (i.e., the wiggling or 
slimy or beautifully blooming part), 
Biodiversity Discovery is an ideal way 
to introduce youth to hands-on 
science.

Many gateway communities, especially 
near urban parks, have little knowledge 
of or access to the amazing biodiversity 
that exists literally on their doorsteps.

The human-power in volunteer 
Biodiversity Discovery activities can be 
enough to accomplish surveys and 
collections in just a few days. This 
would not be possible through 

traditional research projects, with park 
staff, or with researchers working alone 
over many years.

Many volunteers return every year and 
have become park enthusiasts. This 
passion for parks and biodiversity helps 
support the NPS mission to understand 
and protect park resources.

Needs:

  Volunteer management and 

logistical support

  A common evaluative framework to 

assess benefits to volunteers and 
citizen scientists

  Continued Service-wide support

Advancing Science and Stewardship
Biodiversity Discovery helps us confirm the presence of plants and animals and dis-
cover new species. As we move into the second century of protection of parks, this 
knowledge will:

  Serve as a scientific baseline: Understanding what we have before ecosystem-
altering events, whether natural or human-caused, helps us prepare for, adapt 
to, and mitigate the effects of drastic habitat change on species assemblages and 
adaptations. 

  Reveal emerging problems in living resources: Like the vital signs tracked by 
the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program, many of the species identified via 
Biodiversity Discovery may be indicators of broader ecosystem functioning and 
complementary to vital signs information.

  Answer questions on a national scale: A project to model the distribution of 

bee species in 75+ parks across the United States has been funded by the 
Climate Change Response Program to examine possible effects of climate varia-
tion on a critical ecosystem service, pollination. Such coordinated studies lever-
age the geographic scope of the National Park System to answer ecological ques-
tions of national interest.

Today, we face challenges of historical 
significance in global climate change, biodi-
versity loss, and habitat fragmentation due 
to human activities.  

Biodiversity Discovery utilizes the expertise 
of the scientific community and the enthusi-
asm of tomorrows scientists to identify and 
maintain the species and genetic diversity 
that are the foundation of ecosystem resil-
ience in parks and surrounding communities.

While initiated by parks, efforts to coordi-
nate at a national level are improving our 
ability to address comprehensive needs of 
species throughout their geographic ranges, 
enabling better capability to adapt, migrate, 
and persist.

Together, we can ensure these vital com-
ponents of our natural heritage and legacy 
remain intact for future generations.
