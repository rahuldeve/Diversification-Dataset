 
 

EXTENDED RANGE FORECAST OF ATLANTIC SEASONAL HURRICANE 

ACTIVITY AND LANDFALL STRIKE PROBABILITY FOR 2015 

 

We anticipate that the 2015 Atlantic basin hurricane season will be one of the least active 
seasons since the middle of the 20th century.  It appears quite likely that an El Nino of at 
least moderate strength will develop this summer and fall.  The tropical and subtropical 
Atlantic are also quite cool at present.  We anticipate a below-average probability for 

major hurricanes making landfall along the United States coastline and in the Caribbean.  
Despite the forecast for below-average activity, coastal residents are reminded that it only 

takes one hurricane making landfall to make it an active season for them.  They should 

prepare the same for every season, regardless of how much activity is predicted.

ABSTRACT 

 

Information obtained through March 2015 indicates that the 2015 Atlantic 

hurricane season will likely have much less activity than the median 1981-2010 season.  
We estimate that 2015 will have only 3 hurricanes (median is 6.5), 7 named storms 
(median is 12.0), 30 named storm days (median is 60.1), 10 hurricane days (median is 
21.3), 1 major (Category 3-4-5) hurricane (median is 2.0) and 0.5 major hurricane days 
(median is 3.9).  The probability of U.S. major hurricane landfall is estimated to be about 
55 percent of the long-period average.  We expect Atlantic basin Accumulated Cyclone 
Energy (ACE) and Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity in 2015 to be approximately 45 
percent of their long-term averages. 

 
This forecast is based on an extended-range early April statistical prediction 

scheme that was developed utilizing 29 years of past data.  Analog predictors are also 
utilized.  We anticipate a below-average Atlantic basin hurricane season due to the 
combination of a high likelihood of at least a moderate El Nino event and a relatively 
cool tropical Atlantic.  Coastal residents are reminded that it only takes one hurricane 
making landfall to make it an active season for them, and they need to prepare the same 
for every season, regardless of how much activity is predicted.

Special Note from Bill Gray 

 
I began making seasonal Atlantic hurricane forecasts from Colorado State 

University (CSU) in 1984 and have been involved with all of the seasonal forecasts over 
the past 31 years.  Phil Klotzbach joined my research project as a graduate student in 
2000.  He had an outstanding academic undergraduate record and a great desire to study 
hurricanes.   He was a talented graduate student.  He received both his M.S. (2002) and 
Ph. D. (2007) degrees on climate-hurricane related topics.   

 
Phil has shown outstanding growth in his knowledge and prowess as a hurricane 

researcher and forecaster over the last 15 years.  He continues to work full-time at 
improving our understanding of the global climate-hurricane relationship and in the 
development of new and more skillful forecast products. 

 
Klotzbach became lead author on the CSU forecasts in 2006 and in recent years 
has expended most of his efforts in researching and writing up these forecasts and their 
post-season evaluation.  We still talk nearly every day on climate-hurricane matters, and 
no forecast has been released without my detailed comments.  Phil has been making all 
the final forecast decisions in recent years.  He has, nevertheless, appointed me to serve 
in the important role of taking the blame for any and all forecast busts with all credit for 
successful forecasts going to him.  I have fully embraced this special arrangement!  

 
Although I still come to my office every working day and remain quite active, I 

am now devoting more of my research efforts to the climate change and global warming 
issue.  For this reason I will be discontinuing my formal association with these seasonal 
hurricane forecasts at the end of this year.  But I will remain as a special personal advisor 
to Phil in all of his future CSU hurricane forecasts as long as I am able.  

 
I am happy at the progress in climate-hurricane relationship studies that have been 

made by my research project (including former graduate students Chris Landsea, John 
Knaff, Eric Blake and Todd Kimberlain) and by other non-CSU groups since I began 
issuing these forecasts in 1984.  At that time we had no objective way of determining 
how active the upcoming hurricane season was likely to be.  But we do now! 

 
Age, technology change, and my growing new interests in the climate change 

debate dictate that I discontinue my formal involvement with these Atlantic basin 
seasonal hurricane forecasts after this year (my 32nd).  I expect and hope that Phil 
Klotzbach will carry these CSU seasonal hurricane forecasts forward for many years into 
the future with his ever improving hurricane-climate understanding and continuous 
forecast skill improvement.  There is no one (in my view) better able to do this than Phil.  
I will assist him in the coming years as much as I can.

Why issue extended-range forecasts for seasonal 
hurricane activity? 

 
We are frequently asked this question.  Our answer is that it is possible to say 

something about the probability of the coming years hurricane activity which is superior 
to climatology.  The Atlantic basin has the largest year-to-year variability of any of the 
global tropical cyclone basins.  People are curious to know how active the upcoming 
season is likely to be, particularly if you can show hindcast skill improvement over 
climatology for many past years.  

 
Everyone should realize that it is impossible to precisely predict this seasons 
hurricane activity in early April.  There is, however, much curiosity as to how global 
ocean and atmosphere features are presently arranged as regards to the probability of an 
active or inactive hurricane season for the coming year.  Our new early April statistical 
forecast methodology shows strong evidence over 29 past years that significant 
improvement over climatology can be attained.   We would never issue a seasonal 
hurricane forecast unless we had a statistical model developed over a long hindcast 
period which showed significant skill over climatology.  

 
We issue these forecasts to satisfy the curiosity of the general public and to bring 
attention to the hurricane problem.  There is a general interest in knowing what the odds 
are for an active or inactive season.  One must remember that our forecasts are based on 
the premise that those global oceanic and atmospheric conditions which preceded 
comparatively active or inactive hurricane seasons in the past provide meaningful 
information about similar trends in future seasons.   

 
It is also important that the reader appreciate that these seasonal forecasts are 

based on statistical schemes which, owing to their intrinsically probabilistic nature, will 
fail in some years.  Moreover, these forecasts do not specifically predict where within the 
Atlantic basin these storms will strike.  The probability of landfall for any one location 
along the coast is very low and reflects the fact that, in any one season, most U.S. coastal 
areas will not feel the effects of a hurricane no matter how active the individual season is.

DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS 

 

Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) - A measure of a named storms potential for wind and storm surge destruction defined as the sum of the 
square of a named storms maximum wind speed (in 104 knots2) for each 6-hour period of its existence.  The 1950-2000 average value of this 
parameter is 96 for the Atlantic basin. 
 
Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO)  A mode of natural variability that occurs in the North Atlantic Ocean and evidencing itself in 
fluctuations in sea surface temperature and sea level pressure fields.  The AMO is likely related to fluctuations in the strength of the oceanic 
thermohaline circulation.  Although several definitions of the AMO are currently used in the literature, we define the AMO based on North 
Atlantic sea surface temperatures from 50-60N, 50-10W and sea level pressure from 0-50N, 70-10W.   

 

Atlantic Basin  The area including the entire North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 
El Nino  A 12-18 month period during which anomalously warm sea surface temperatures occur in the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific.  
Moderate or strong El Nino events occur irregularly, about once every 3-7 years on average.  
 
Hurricane (H) - A tropical cyclone with sustained low-level winds of 74 miles per hour (33 ms-1 or 64 knots) or greater.   
 
Hurricane Day (HD) - A measure of hurricane activity, one unit of which occurs as four 6-hour periods during which a tropical cyclone is 
observed or is estimated to have hurricane-force winds. 
 
Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - An irregular oscillation of sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern tropical Indian Ocean.  A 
positive phase of the IOD occurs when the western Indian Ocean is anomalously warm compared with the eastern Indian Ocean. 
 
Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO)  A globally propagating mode of tropical atmospheric intra-seasonal variability.  The wave tends to 
propagate eastward at approximately 5 ms-1, circling the globe in roughly 30-60 days. 
 
Main Development Region (MDR)  An area in the tropical Atlantic where a majority of major hurricanes form, which we define as 7.5-
22.5N, 75-20W.   
 
Major Hurricane (MH) - A hurricane which reaches a sustained low-level wind of at least 111 mph (96 knots or 50 ms-1) at some point in its 
lifetime.  This constitutes a category 3 or higher on the Saffir/Simpson scale. 
 
Major Hurricane Day (MHD) - Four 6-hour periods during which a hurricane has an intensity of Saffir/Simpson category 3 or higher.   
 
Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI)  An index defining ENSO that takes into account tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, sea level 
pressures, zonal and meridional winds and cloudiness. 
 
Named Storm (NS) - A hurricane, a tropical storm or a sub-tropical storm. 
 
Named Storm Day (NSD) - As in HD but for four 6-hour periods during which a tropical or sub-tropical cyclone is observed (or is estimated) 
to have attained tropical storm-force winds.   
 
Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) Activity Average seasonal percentage mean of NS, NSD, H, HD, MH, MHD.  Gives overall indication of 
Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane activity.  The 1950-2000 average value of this parameter is 100. 
 
Proxy  An approximation or a substitution for a physical process that cannot be directly measured. 
 
Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale  A measurement scale ranging from 1 to 5 of hurricane wind intensity.  One is a weak hurricane; 
whereas, five is the most intense hurricane. 
 
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)  A normalized measure of the surface pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin. Low values typically 
indicate El Nino conditions. 
 
Sea Surface Temperature  SST 
 
Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly  SSTA  
 
Thermohaline Circulation (THC)  A large-scale circulation in the Atlantic Ocean that is driven by fluctuations in salinity and temperature.  
When the THC is stronger than normal, the AMO tends to be in its warm (or positive) phase, and more Atlantic hurricanes typically form. 
 
Tropical Cyclone (TC) - A large-scale circular flow occurring within the tropics and subtropics which has its strongest winds at low levels; 
including hurricanes, tropical storms and other weaker rotating vortices. 
 
Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) index  A measure of sea surface temperatures in the area from 5.5-23.5N, 57.5-15W. 
 
Tropical Storm (TS) - A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds between 39 mph (18 ms-1 or 34 knots) and 73 mph (32 ms-1 or 63 
knots). 
 
Vertical Wind Shear  The difference in horizontal wind between 200 mb (approximately 40000 feet or 12 km) and 850 mb (approximately 
5000 feet or 1.6 km). 
 

1 knot = 1.15 miles per hour = 0.515 meters per second

Introduction 
 
This is the 32nd year in which the CSU Tropical Meteorology Project has made 
forecasts of the upcoming seasons Atlantic basin hurricane activity.  Our research team 
has shown that a sizable portion of the year-to-year variability of Atlantic tropical 
cyclone (TC) activity can be hindcast with skill exceeding climatology.  This years April 
forecast is based on a statistical methodology derived from 29 years of past data.  
Qualitative adjustments are added to accommodate additional processes which may not 
be explicitly represented by our statistical analyses.  These evolving forecast techniques 
are based on a variety of climate-related global and regional predictors previously shown 
to be related to the forthcoming seasonal Atlantic basin TC activity and landfall 
probability.  We believe that seasonal forecasts must be based on methods that show 
significant hindcast skill in application to long periods of prior data.  It is only through 
hindcast skill that one can demonstrate that seasonal forecast skill is possible.  This is a 
valid methodology provided that the atmosphere continues to behave in the future as it 
has in the past.   

 
The best predictors do not necessarily have the best individual correlations with 
hurricane activity.  The best forecast parameters are those that explain the portion of the 
variance of seasonal hurricane activity that is not associated with the other forecast 
variables.  It is possible for an important hurricane forecast parameter to show little direct 
relationship to a predictand by itself but to have an important influence when included 
with a set of 2-3 other predictors.   

 
A direct correlation of a forecast parameter may not be the best measure of the 
importance of this predictor to the skill of a 3-4 parameter forecast model.  This is the 
nature of the seasonal or climate forecast problem where one is dealing with a very 
complicated atmospheric-oceanic system that is highly non-linear.  There is a maze of 
changing physical linkages between the many variables.  These linkages can undergo 
unknown changes from weekly to decadal time scales.  It is impossible to understand 
how all of these processes interact with each other.  No one can completely understand 
the full complexity of the atmosphere-ocean system.  But, it is still possible to develop a 
reliable statistical forecast scheme which incorporates a number of the climate systems 
non-linear interactions.  Any seasonal or climate forecast scheme should show significant 
hindcast skill before it is used in real-time forecasts.  

 
 
April Forecast Methodology 

2 
 
2.1       April Statistical Forecast Scheme 

 
Our current April statistical forecast model was built over the period from 1982-

2010 to incorporate the most recent and reliable data that was available. It utilizes a total 
of four predictors.  The new Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) (Saha et al. 
2010) has been completed from 1979-present, while the NOAA Optimum Interpolation 
(OI) SST (Reynolds et al. 2002) is available from 1982-present.  This new model shows 

 

8 

significant skill in predicting levels of Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity over the 
1982-2010 developmental period.  NTC is a combined measure of the year-to-year mean 
of six indices of hurricane activity, each expressed as a percentage difference from the 
1950-2000 climatological average.  The model correlates with NTC at 0.57 from 1982-
2014 when a drop-one cross-validation (jackknife) analysis is conducted.  A cross-
validation approach provides a more realistic view of skill the model is expected to have 
in future years. 

 
 Table 1 displays cross-validated NTC hindcasts for 1982-2010 along with real-

time forecast values for 2011-2014 using the new statistical scheme, while Figure 1 
displays observations versus cross-validated NTC hindcasts.  The large forecast bust of 
our early April prediction that occurred in 2013 was due to massive changes in the 
tropical and subtropical Atlantic that occurred after the issuance of this forecast.  The 
model correctly predicted a below-average season in 2014.   

 
We have correctly predicted by early April above- or below-average seasons in 23 

out of 33 hindcast years (70%).   Our predictions have had a smaller error than 
climatology in 20 out of 33 years (61%).  Our average hindcast error is 44 NTC units, 
compared with 53 NTC units for climatology.  Figure 2 displays the locations of each of 
our predictors, while Table 2 displays the individual linear correlations between each 
predictor and NTC over the 1982-2010 hindcast period.  All predictors correlate 
significantly at the 90% level using a two-tailed Students t-test and assuming that each 
year represents an individual degree of freedom.  The reader will note that we are 
incorporating a dynamical SST forecast from the European Centre for Medium-Range 
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).  Hindcast data provided by Frederic Vitart indicates that 
the ECMWF model system 3 has significant forecast skill for SSTs across the various 
Nino regions for September from a 1 March forecast date.  We utilize the ECMWF 
ensemble mean prediction for September Nino 3 SSTs.  The ECMWF has recently 
upgraded to system 4.  Hindcast data from this new model is not available yet, but it is 
assumed that the model has improved skill to system 3.  Hindcast data from 1982-2010 
show that the ECMWF forecast from system 3 from a 1 March issue date correlates with 
observed September Nino 3 SSTs at 0.63.  Table 3 displays the 2015 observed values for 
each of the four predictors in the new statistical forecast scheme.  Table 4 displays the 
statistical model output for the 2015 hurricane season.

our new forecast scheme as well as the statistical model's real-time output for 2011-2014.  
Average errors for cross-validated hindcast NTC and climatological NTC predictions are 
given without respect to sign.  Red bold-faced years in the Hindcast NTC column are 
years that we did not go the right way, while red bold-faced years in the Hindcast 
improvement over Climatology column are years that we did not beat climatology.  The 
hindcast went the right way with regards to an above- or below-average season in 23 out 
of 33 years (70%), while hindcast improvement over climatology occurred in 20 out of 
33 years (61%).  The hindcast has improved upon climatology in all but seven years since 
1993.

Figure 3:  Vertical wind profile typically associated with (a) inactive Atlantic basin 
hurricane seasons and (b) active Atlantic basin hurricane seasons.  Note that (b) has 
reduced levels of vertical wind shear.   
 
For each of these predictors, we display a four-panel figure showing linear correlations 
between values of each predictor and August-October values of sea surface temperature 
(SST), sea level pressure (SLP), 200 mb zonal wind, and 850 mb zonal wind, 
respectively.  In general, higher values of SSTs, lower values of SLP, anomalous 
westerlies at 850 mb and anomalous easterlies at 200 mb are associated with active 
Atlantic basin hurricane seasons.   SST correlations are displayed using the NOAA 
Optimum Interpolation (OI) SST, SLP and 850 mb zonal wind correlations are displayed 
using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), while 200 mb zonal wind 
correlations are displayed using the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, as there are questions 
about the quality of the upper-level wind reanalysis in the CFSR. 
 

Predictor 1.  January-March SST in the Tropical and Subtropical Eastern Atlantic (+) 

 

 

(5S-35N, 40-10W) 

 

13 

Warmer-than-normal SSTs in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic during the January-
March time period are associated with a weaker-than-normal subtropical high and 
reduced trade wind strength during the boreal spring (Knaff 1997).  Positive SSTs in 
January-March are correlated with weaker trade winds and weaker upper tropospheric 
westerly winds, lower-than-normal sea level pressures and above-normal SSTs in the 
tropical Atlantic during the following August-October period (Figure 4).  All three of 
these August-October features are commonly associated with active Atlantic basin 
hurricane seasons, through reductions in vertical wind shear, increased vertical instability 
and increased mid-tropospheric moisture, respectively.  Predictor 1 correlates quite 
strongly (~0.6) with NTC.  Predictor 1 also strongly correlates (r = 0.65) with August-
October values of the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) (Kossin and Vimont 2007) over 
the period from 1982-2010.  The AMM has been shown to impact Atlantic hurricane 
activity through alterations in the position and intensity of the Atlantic Inter-Tropical 
Convergence Zone (ITCZ).  Changes in the Atlantic ITCZ bring about changes in tropical 
Atlantic vertical and horizontal wind shear patterns and in tropical Atlantic SST patterns. 
 

Predictor 2.  March SLP in the Subtropical Atlantic (-) 

 

(20-40N, 35-20W) 

 

Our April statistical scheme in the late 1990s used a similar predictor when evaluating the 
strength of the March Atlantic sub-tropical ridge (Azores High).  If the pressure in this 
area is higher than normal, it correlates strongly with increased Atlantic trade winds.  
These stronger trades enhance ocean mixing and upwelling, driving cooler tropical 
Atlantic SSTs.  These cooler SSTs are associated with higher-than-normal sea level 
pressures which can create a self-enhancing feedback that relates to higher pressure, 
stronger trades and cooler SSTs during the hurricane season (Figure 5) (Knaff 1998).  All 
three of these factors are associated with inactive hurricane seasons.    
 

Predictor 3.  February-March SLP in the southeastern tropical Pacific (+) 

 

(5-20S, 120-85W) 

 

High pressure in the southeastern tropical Pacific during the months of February-March 
correlates strongly with a positive Southern Oscillation Index and strong trades blowing 
across the eastern tropical Pacific.  Strong trade winds help prevent eastward propagating 
Kelvin waves from transporting warmth from the western Pacific warm pool region and 
triggering El Nino conditions. During the August-October period, positive values of this 
predictor are associated with weaker trades, lower sea level pressures, and relatively cool 
SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific (typical of La Nina conditions) (Figure 6).  The 
combination of these features is typically associated with more active hurricane seasons.   
 

Predictor 4.  ECMWF 1 March SST Forecast for September Nino 3 (-) 

 

 

(5S -5N, 150-90W) 

 

14 

The ECMWF seasonal forecast system 3 has shown skill at being able to predict SST 
anomalies associated with ENSO several months into the future (Stockdale et al. 2011).  
ECMWF has recently upgraded their seasonal forecast system to system 4.  ENSO has 
been documented in many studies to be one of the primary factors associated with 
interannual fluctuations in Atlantic basin and U.S. landfalling hurricane activity (Gray 
1984, Goldenberg and Shapiro 1996, Bove et al. 1998, Klotzbach 2011), primarily 
through alterations in vertical wind shear patterns.  The ensemble-averaged ENSO 
forecast for September values of the Nino 3 region from a 1 March forecast date 
correlates with observations at 0.63, which is impressive considering that this forecast 
goes through the springtime predictability barrier, where fluctuations in ENSO lead to 
greatly reduced forecast skill.  When the ECMWF model predicts cool SST anomalies for 
September, it strongly correlates with observed cool anomalies throughout the tropical 
Pacific associated with La Nina conditions, as well as reduced vertical wind shear, 
especially across the Caribbean (Figure 7).

appears to be with MDR-averaged SST.  The correlation scale has been reversed (sign 
changed) to allow for easy comparison of correlations for all four predictors.

predictors.

Forecast Uncertainty 

One of the questions that we are asked regarding our seasonal hurricane 

predictions is the degree of uncertainty that is involved.  Our predictions are our best 
estimate, but there is with all forecasts an uncertainty as to how well they will verify.   

 
Table 5 provides our early April forecast, with error bars based on one standard 

deviation of the 1982-2010 cross-validated hindcast error.  We typically expect to see 2/3 

 

19 

of our forecasts verify within one standard deviation of observed values, with 95% of 
forecasts verifying within two standard deviations of observed values.  Note the rather 
large uncertainty ranges at this extended lead time.    Large changes can occur during the 
spring months, such as the massive weakening of the AMO that occurred in 2013, and 
can cause significant errors in these early season predictions.

Analog-Based Predictors for 2015 Hurricane Activity 

Certain years in the historical record have global oceanic and atmospheric trends 

which are similar to 2015.  These years also provide useful clues as to likely trends in 
activity that the forthcoming 2015 hurricane season may bring.  For this early April 
extended range forecast, we determine which of the prior years in our database have 
distinct trends in key environmental conditions which are similar to current February-
March 2015 conditions as well as projected August-October 2015 conditions.  Table 6 
lists our analog selections. 

 
We select prior hurricane seasons since 1950 which have similar atmospheric-

oceanic conditions to those currently being experienced and those that we expect to see 
this summer and fall.  We searched for years that were generally characterized by at least 
moderate El Nino conditions and cool conditions in the tropical Atlantic during the 
upcoming hurricane season.   

 
There were five hurricane seasons since 1950 with characteristics most similar to 
what we expect to see in August-October of 2015.  We anticipate that the 2015 hurricane 
season will have slightly less activity than the average of our five analog years.    We 
believe that this season should experience well below-average activity.

ENSO 

Weak El Nino conditions developed during the winter of 2014/2015.  The Nino 
3.4 index (5S-5N, 170-120W) has generally stayed above 0.5C for the past several 
months (Figure 8), causing the Climate Prediction Center to officially declare El Nino 
underway in February.   

 

 

 

Figure 8:  Nino 3.4 SST anomalies from April 2014 through March 2015.     

 
 Upper-ocean heat content anomalies in the eastern and central tropical Pacific 

have increased over the past couple of months (Figure 9).  These anomalies are now 
approaching values that were present last year at this time.  In addition, it appears that the 
warming that has occurred so far this year is more likely to persist than the warming that 
occurred last year.

Figure 9:  Central and eastern tropical Pacific upper ocean (0-300 meters) heat content 
anomalies over the past year.  Upper ocean heat content has increased considerably since 
early January 2015.     

 
SSTs are currently near their average values in the eastern tropical Pacific with 
warmer than normal SSTs in the central tropical Pacific.   Table 7 displays January and 
March SST anomalies for several Nino regions.  We expect to see warming in most of the 
Nino regions over the next couple of months as a downwelling Kelvin wave approaches 
the eastern tropical Pacific (Figure 10).   The very strong downwelling Kelvin wave that 
occurred last spring was attenuated by a strong upwelling phase, while the current 
downwelling Kelvin wave is unlikely to have a significant upwelling phase due to the 
significant westerly wind anomalies that have been present over the past several weeks.

Dashed lines indicate downwelling Kelvin waves, while dotted lines indicate upwelling 
Kelvin waves.   

 

 
The strongest westerly wind burst since 1997 has recently occurred in the central 

tropical Pacific (Figure 11).  Westerly wind bursts are one of the primary mechanisms for 
generating El Nino events by driving downwelling Kelvin waves which transport warm 
water from the western tropical Pacific eastward towards the relatively cool water in the 
eastern and central tropical Pacific.

westerlies that were present during the middle part of March near and west of the 
International Date Line.   
 

Figure 12 shows the current upper-ocean sub-surface temperature anomaly 

structure.  Note the very warm sub-surface temperature anomalies across the eastern and 
central tropical Pacific.  As the Kelvin wave continues to propagate eastward, these 
anomalies should reach the surface as the depth of the thermocline shallows.

warm sub-surface temperature anomalies in the central portion of the basin.   

 
 By August-October, most dynamical models are calling for moderate or strong El 

Nino conditions (Figure 13).  We find that, in general, the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) shows the best prediction skill of the various ENSO 
models.  The correlation skill between a 1 March forecast from the ECMWF model 
system 3 and the observed September Nino 3.4 anomaly is 0.71, based on 
hindcasts/forecasts from 1982-2010, explaining half of the variance in Nino 3.4 SST. The 
ECMWF has recently upgraded to system 4, which is likely to have somewhat better skill 
than the previous version.  The hindcast skill from ECMWF is very impressive, 
considering that the prediction goes through the springtime predictability barrier.  The 
average of the various ECMWF ensemble members is calling for a September Nino 3.4 
SST anomaly of approximately 1.7C.  There is a fairly widespread range in the 
outcomes predicted by the various ensemble members, which indicates the large degree 
of uncertainty in future ENSO conditions (Figure 14).  In general, we put more credence 
in the ECMWF prediction than in forecasts from the other models, and consequently, we 
are calling for at least a moderate strength El Nino event. 

 

 

25 

 

Figure 13:  ENSO forecasts from various statistical and dynamical models for the Nino 
3.4 SST anomaly.  Figure courtesy of the International Research Institute (IRI).  Most 
dynamical models are calling for a moderate to strong El Nino event during the August-
October period.   

 

 

 

26 

 
Figure 14:  ECMWF ensemble model forecast for the Nino 3.4 region.  Most members 
are calling for a strong El Nino event this summer and fall.   

 
Based on the above information, our best estimate is that we will likely have at 

 

least a moderate strength El Nino event during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.  
The current downwelling Kelvin wave is likely to generate significant warming in the 
eastern and central tropical Pacific.  In addition, the western tropical Pacific has begun to 
cool over the past few weeks (Figure 15) which should help shift deep convection from 
the western Pacific towards the central Pacific helping to reinforce the developing El 
Nino.   There remains a need to closely monitor ENSO conditions over the next few 
months.  We should be more confident about ENSO conditions for the upcoming 
hurricane season by the time of our next forecast on June 1.

Pacific (highlighted by the red rectangle) is now cooler than normal.  This is usually an 
early indicator of El Nino development.   
 

 

 
Current Atlantic Basin Conditions 

6 
 

As was the case in 2014, significant anomalous cooling occurred across the 
tropical and subtropical Atlantic during the winter of 2014/2015.  The current SST 
pattern (Figure 16) across the Atlantic looks more like a negative Atlantic Multidecadal 
Oscillation (AMO) pattern with anomalously cool water in the North Atlantic, subtropical 
eastern Atlantic and tropical Atlantic.  In addition, warm SST anomalies off of the US 
East Coast are typically associated with a negative AMO.   Much of this anomalous 
cooling is due to a persistent positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) since 
late November of last year (Figure 17).  A positive phase of the NAO is associated with a 
strengthened Atlantic subtropical high pressure gyre (Figure 18) and anomalously strong 
trades across the tropical Atlantic.  This promotes enhanced mixing as well as upwelling 
of cold water.  Anomalously strong westerly winds in the mid-latitudes also promote 
anomalous ocean currents out of the north, which contributes to general cooling SSTs 
throughout the North Atlantic basin.  Figure 19 displays the cooling in SSTs observed in 
the tropical Atlantic from the latter part of March minus the latter part of November 
2014.

a combination of our statistical scheme, our analog scheme and qualitative adjustments 
for other factors not explicitly contained in either of these schemes.  Both our analog and

Landfall Probabilities for 2015 

A significant focus of our recent research involves efforts to develop forecasts of 

the probability of hurricane landfall along the U.S. coastline and in the Caribbean.  
Whereas individual hurricane landfall events cannot be accurately forecast months in 
advance, the total seasonal probability of landfall can be forecast with statistical skill.  
With the observation that landfall is a function of varying climate conditions, a 
probability specification has been developed through statistical analyses of all U.S. 
hurricane and named storm landfall events during the 20th century (1900-1999).  Specific 
landfall probabilities can be given for all tropical cyclone intensity classes for a set of 
distinct U.S. coastal regions. 

 
 Net landfall probability is shown linked to the overall Atlantic basin Net Tropical 

Cyclone activity (NTC; see Table 9).  NTC is a combined measure of the year-to-year 
mean of six indices of hurricane activity, each expressed as a percentage difference from 
the 1950-2000 climatological average.  Long-term statistics show that, on average, the 
more active the overall Atlantic basin hurricane season is, the greater the probability of 
U.S. hurricane landfall.   

 

Table 9:   NTC activity in any year consists of the seasonal total of the following six 
parameters expressed in terms of their long-term averages.  A season with 10 NS, 50 
NSD, 6 H, 25 HD, 3 MH, and 5 MHD would then be the sum of the following ratios: 
10/9.6 = 104, 50/49.1 = 102, 6/5.9 = 102, 25/24.5 = 102, 3/2.3 = 130, 5/5.0 = 100, 
divided by six, yielding an NTC of 107.

Table 10 lists landfall probabilities for the 2015 hurricane season for different TC 

categories for the entire U.S. coastline, the Gulf Coast and the East Coast including the 
Florida peninsula.  We also issue probabilities for various islands and landmasses in the 
Caribbean and in Central America.  Note that Atlantic basin NTC activity in 2015 is 
expected to be well below its long-term average of 100, and therefore, landfall 
probabilities are well below their long-term average.  

 
Please visit the Landfalling Probability Webpage at http://www.e-

transit.org/hurricane for landfall probabilities for 11 U.S. coastal regions and 205 
coastal and near-coastal counties from Brownsville, Texas to Eastport, Maine.  The 
probability of each U.S. coastal state being impacted by hurricanes and major 
hurricanes is also included.  In addition, we now include probabilities of named 
storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes tracking within 50 and 100 miles of 
various islands and landmasses in the Caribbean and Central America.  We suggest 
that all coastal residents visit the Landfall Probability Webpage for their individual 
probabilities. 

 
As an example we find that the probability of Florida being hit by a major (Cat 3-
4-5) hurricane this year is 10% which is well below the climatological average of 21%.  

 
South Florida is much more prone to being impacted by a hurricane on an 

individual-year basis compared with northeast Florida.  For instance, the probability of 
Miami-Dade County being impacted by hurricane-force wind gusts this year is 5%.  For 
Duval County, the probability of being impacted by hurricane-force wind gusts is only 
1%.   However, considering a 50-year period, the probability of Duval County 
experiencing hurricane-force wind gusts is 75%.  

 
For the island of Puerto Rico, the probability of a named storm, hurricane and 
major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of the island this year is 16%, 7%, and 2%, 
respectively.

and along the Florida Peninsula and the East Coast (Regions 5-11) for 2015.

Summary 

9 
 

An analysis of a variety of different atmosphere and ocean measurements 

(through March) which are known to have long-period statistical relationships with the 
upcoming season's Atlantic tropical cyclone activity indicate that 2015 should be a very 
quiet hurricane season.  The big question marks with this season's predictions are how 
strong El Nino is going to be, as well as if tropical and North Atlantic Ocean SSTAs 
remain as cool as they are now.

two-week forecasts for Atlantic TC activity during the climatological peak of the season 
from August-October.   A verification and discussion of all 2015 forecasts will be issued 
in late November 2015.  All of these forecasts will be available online at:

McNoldy, Art Douglas, Ray Zehr, Mark DeMaria, Todd Kimberlain, Paul Roundy, Jason 
Dunion and Amato Evan.  In addition, Barbara Brumit and Amie Hedstrom have 
provided excellent manuscript, graphical and data analysis and assistance over a number 
of years.  We have profited over the years from many in-depth discussions with most of 
the current and past NHC hurricane forecasters.  The second author would further like to 
acknowledge the encouragement he has received for this type of forecasting research 
application from Neil Frank, Robert Sheets, Robert Burpee, Jerry Jarrell, Max Mayfield, 
and Bill Read former directors of the National Hurricane Center (NHC), and the current 
director, Rick Knabb.
