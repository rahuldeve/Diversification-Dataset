Why Save 
Endangered 
Species?

Since life began on Earth, 
countless creatures have 
come and gone, rendered 
extinct by naturally 
changing physical and 
biological conditions.

Since extinction is part 
of the natural order, and 
if many other species 
remain, some people ask: 
Why save endangered 
species? Why should we 
spend money and effort 
to conserve them?  
How do we benefit?

Congress answered these questions 
in the preamble to the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, recognizing that 
endangered and threatened species of 
wildlife and plants are of esthetic, 
ecological, educational, historical, 
recreational, and scientific value to 
the Nation and its people. In this 
statement, Congress summarized 
convincing arguments made by 
scientists, conservationists, and 
others who are concerned by the 
disappearance of unique creatures. 
Congress further stated its intent 
that the Act should conserve the 
ecosystems upon which endangered 
and threatened species depend.

Although extinctions occur naturally, 
scientific evidence strongly indicates 
that the current rate of extinction 
is much higher than the natural or 
background rate of the past. The 
main force driving this higher rate of 
loss is habitat loss. Over-exploitation 

of wildlife for commercial 

purposes, the introduction of 
harmful exotic (nonnative) 
organisms, environmental 
pollution, and the spread 
of diseases also pose 

serious threats to our 
worlds biological 
heritage.

Conservation actions carried out 
in the United States under the 
Endangered Species Act have been 
successful in preventing extinction 
for 99 percent of the species that are 
listed as endangered or threatened. 
However, species loss on a global 
scale continues to increase due to 
the environmental effects of human 
activities. 

Biologists estimate that since the 
Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock 
in 1620, more than 500 species, 
subspecies, and varieties of our 
Nations plants and animals have 
become extinct. The situation in 
Earths most biologically rich 
ecosystems is even worse. Tropical 
rainforests around the world, which 
may contain up to one half of all living 
species, are losing millions of acres 
every year. Uncounted species are 
lost as these habitats are destroyed. 
In short, there is nothing natural 
about todays rate of extinction.

Not too long ago, almost one quarter of the trees in the 
Appalachian forests were American chestnuts. They helped 
support not only wildlife but the people living among 
them. Chestnuts were an important cash crop for many 
families. As year-end holidays approached, nuts by the 
railroad car were sold and shipped to northeastern cities. 
Chestnut timber, strong and rot resistant, was prized for 
building barns, fences, furniture, and other products. This 
photograph of the Shelton family, taken around 1920, shows 
the size American chestnut trees once reached.

First detected in 1904, an Asian fungus to which native 
chestnuts had little resistance appeared in New York City 
trees. The blight spread quickly, and by 1950 the American 
chestnut was virtually extinct except for occasional root 
sprouts that also became infected. Organizations such 
as the American Chestnut Foundation are working with 
plant breeders to develop a disease resistant strain and 
restore it to the eastern forests.

Benefits of Natural Diversity
How many species of plants and 
animals are there? Although scientists 
have classified approximately 
1.7 million organisms, they recognize 
that the overwhelming majority have 
not yet been catalogued. Between 
10 and 50 million species may inhabit 
our planet.

None of these creatures exists in a 
vacuum. All living things are part of 
a complex, often delicately balanced 
network called the biosphere. The 
earths biosphere, in turn, is composed 
of countless ecosystems, which include 
plants and animals and their physical 
environments. No one knows how the 
extinction of organisms will affect 
the other members of its ecosystem, 
but the removal of a single species 
can set off a chain reaction affecting 
many others. This is especially true 
for keystone species, whose loss can 
transform or undermine the ecological 
processes or fundamentally change 
the species composition of the wildlife 
community.

Gray wolf

The gray wolf is one such keystone 
species. When wolves were restored 
to Yellowstone National Park, they 
started to control the parks large 
population of elk, which had been 
over consuming the willows, aspen, 
and other trees that grew along 
streams. The recovery of these trees 
is cooling stream flows, which benefits 
native trout, and increases nesting 
habitat for migratory birds. Beavers 
now have willow branches to eat, 
and beaver dams create marshland 
habitat for otters, mink, and ducks. 
Wolves even benefit the threatened 
grizzly bear, since grizzlies find it 
easier to take over a wolf kill than to 
bring down their own elk.

Contributions to Medicine
One of the many tangible benefits 
of biological diversity has been its 
contributions to the field of medicine. 
Each living thing contains a unique 
reservoir of genetic material that 
has evolved over eons. This material 
cannot be retrieved or duplicated 
if lost. So far, scientists have 
investigated only a small fraction 
of the worlds species and have just 
begun to unravel their chemical 
secrets to find possible human health 
benefits to mankind.

No matter how small or obscure a 
species, it could one day be of direct 
importance to us all. It was only 
a fungus that gave us penicillin, 
and certain plants have yielded 
substances used in drugs to treat 
heart disease, cancer, and a variety of 
other illnesses. More than a quarter 
of all prescriptions written annually in 
the United States contain chemicals 
discovered in plants and animals. If 
these organisms had been destroyed 
before their unique chemistries were 
known, their secrets would have died 
with them.

A few hundred wild species have 
stocked our pharmacies with 
antibiotics, anti-cancer agents, pain 
killers, and blood thinners. The 
biochemistry of unexamined species is 
an unfathomed reservoir of new and 
potentially more effective substances. 
The reason is found in the principles 
of evolutionary biology. Caught in an 
endless arms race with other forms 
of life, these species have devised 
myriad ways to combat microbes 
and cancer-causing runaway cells.

molecules that may never occur to a 
chemist. For example, the anti-cancer 
compound taxol, originally extracted 
from the bark of the Pacific yew 
tree, is too fiendishly complex a 
chemical structure for researchers 
to have invented on their own, said 
a scientist with the U.S. National 
Cancer Institute. Taxol has become 
the standard treatment for advanced 
cases of ovarian cancer, which strikes 
thousands of women every year. 
But until the discovery of taxols 
effectiveness, the Pacific yew was 
considered a weed tree of no value 
and was routinely destroyed during 
logging operations.

Some of the most promising natural 
wonder drugs come from compounds 
not usually associated with healing: 
poisons. One pharmaceutical company 
is marketing a blood thinner based on 
the venom of the deadly saw-scaled 
viper. A protein from another Asian 
pit viper is being studied because 
it appears to inhibit the spread of 
melanoma cells, and a compound 
from the venom of some tarantula 
species may lead to new treatments 
for neurological disorders such as 
Parkinsons disease.

Biodiversity and Agriculture
Many seemingly insignificant forms of 
life are beginning to show important 
benefits for agriculture. Farmers are 
using insects and other animals that 
prey on certain crop pests, as well as 
using plants containing natural-toxins 
that repel harmful insects. These are 
called biological controls, and in 
many cases they are a safe, effective, 
and less expensive alternative to 
synthetic chemicals.

Thomas Jefferson once wrote that 
the greatest service which can be 
rendered any country is to add a 
useful plant to its culture, especially 
a breadgrain. It has been estimated 
that there are almost 80,000 species

of edible plants, of which fewer than 
20 produce 90 percent of the worlds 
food. If underutilized species are 
conserved, they could help to feed 
growing populations. One grain 
native to the Great Lakes States, 
Indian wild rice, is superior in protein 
to most domesticated rice, and its 
increasing commercial production 
earns millions of dollars annually. 
Crossing it with a related but 
endangered species, Texas wild rice, 
could result in a strain adaptable to 
other regions of the country.

Walkers manioc is an endangered plant endemic to 
the Lower Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas and 
northeastern Mexico. It is closely related to an important 
crop plant, cassava, which is a staple food in many parts 
of the world. Walkers manioc could contain genes that 
provide salt, drought, cold, or disease resistance for strains 
of commercial cassava.

Environmental Monitors
Many individual species are 
uniquely important as indicators of 
environmental quality. The rapid 
decline in bald eagles and peregrine 
falcons in the mid-20th century was 
a dramatic warning of the dangers 
of DDTa strong, once widely used 
pesticide that accumulates in body 
tissues. (It hampered fertility and egg-
hatching success in these species.) In 
another example, lichens and certain 
plants like the eastern white pine are 
good indicators of excess ozone, sulfur 
dioxide, and other air pollutants. 
Species like these can alert us to the 
effects of some contaminants before 
more damage is done.

Freshwater mussels are also very 
effective environmental indicators. 
The eastern United States boasts 
the richest diversity of freshwater 
mussels in the world. These animals 
are filter feeders, drawing in water 
and straining out food particles. Their 
method of feeding helps to keep our 
waters clean. But because mussels

filter material from the water, they 
are often the first animals to be 
affected by water pollution. They 
tend to accumulate whatever toxins, 
such as chemicals in agricultural 
and industrial runoff, are present 
in their habitat. Too much pollution 
can eliminate the mussels. Other 
threats to mussel populations 
include siltation, the introduction of 
competing nonnative mussels, stream 
channelization and dredging, and 
the impoundment of free-flowing 
streams and rivers. Today, most 
native freshwater mussel species 
are considered to be endangered, 
threatened, or of special concern.

Ecosystem Services
As the pioneering naturalist Aldo 
Leopold once stated, To keep every 
cog and wheel is the first precaution 
of intelligent tinkering. As we 
tinker with ecosystems through our 
effects on the environment, what 
unexpected changes could occur? 
One subject of increasing concern is 
the impacts these effects can have 
on ecosystem services, which is a 
term for the fundamental life-support 
services provided by our environment. 
Ecosystem services include air and 
water purification, detoxification and 
decomposition of wastes, climate 
regulation, regeneration of soil 
fertility, and the production and 
maintenance of biological diversity. 
These are the key ingredients of our 
agricultural, pharmaceutical, and 
industrial enterprises. Such services 
are estimated to be worth trillions 
of dollars annually. Yet because most 
of these services are not traded in 
economic markets, they carry no price 
tags that could alert society to changes 
in their supply or declines in their 
functioning. We tend to pay attention 
only when they decline or fail.

Alpine pennycress

An emerging field called 
phytoremediation is an example of 
the ecosystem services provided 
by plants. Phytoremediation is a 
process that uses plants to remove, 
transfer, stabilize, and destroy 
contaminants in soil and sediment. 
Certain plant species known as metal 
hyperaccumulators have the ability 
to extract elements from the soil 
and concentrate them in the easily 
harvested plant stems, shoots, and 
leaves. The alpine pennycress, for 
example, doesnt just thrive on soils 
contaminated with zinc and cadmium; 
it cleans them up by removing 
the excess metals. In the home, 
houseplants under some conditions 
can effectively remove benzene, 
formaldehyde, and certain other 
pollutants from the air.

Other Economic Values
Some benefits of animals and plants 
can be quantified. For example, the 
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 
calls birding the nations fastest 
growing outdoor recreation. It 
estimates that birders pump an 
estimated $400 million each year 
into the states economy. A host 
of small rural towns host festivals 
to vie for the attention of these 
birders. Nationwide, the benefits 
are even more amazing. In a recent 
study (Birding in the United States: 
A Demographic and Economic 
Analysis), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service estimated that wildlife 
watchingnot just bird watching
generated $85 billion in economic 
benefits to the nation in 2001.

Intangible Values
If imperiled plants and animals 
lack a known benefit to mankind, 
should we care if they disappear? 
If a species evolves over millennia 
or is created by divine intent, 
do we have a right to cause its 
extinction? Would our descendants 
forgive us for exterminating a 
unique form of life? Such questions 
are not exclusive to scientists 
or philosophers. Many people 
believe that every creature has an 
intrinsic value. The loss of plant 
and animal species, they say, is 
not only shortsighted but wrong, 
especially since an extinct species 
can never be replaced. Eliminating 
entire species has been compared 
to ripping pages out of books that 
have not yet been read. We are 
accustomed to a rich diversity in 
nature. This diversity has provided 
inspiration for countless writers and 
artists, and all others who treasure 
variety in the natural world.

Among its many values, wildlife is a source of inspiration. 
For example, the bird paintings by John James Audubon, 
such as this image of ivory-billed woodpeckers, are 
recognized as fine art. Once feared to be extinct, the 
ivory-bill was rediscovered recently in Arkansas.

In his story 
The Bear, 
writer William 
Faulkner depicted 
a number of 
creatures that 
are now rare, 
including wolves, 
panthers, the 
ivory-billed 
woodpecker, 
and, of course, 
the animal 
now known as 
the Louisiana 
black bear.
