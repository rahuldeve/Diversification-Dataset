The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

Executive summary
BACKGROUND
In 2006, the Building Code of Australia (BCA) set a new residential building energy efficiency standard of
5 stars, as rated by software tools accredited under the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme
(NatHERS). To reach the 5-star energy efficiency standard, architects and builders could choose from a large
variety of options, such as increasing insulation in ceilings, walls and floors; using double glazing; and
redesigning house layout and orientation.
The Regulation Impact Statement (RIS) on the 5-star standard analysed its likely impact on the energy
efficiency of new houses relative to the previous standard. The RIS estimated that the 5-star standard
would reduce heating and cooling energy costs, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. In 2012, to assess
whether the new standard was achieving its goals, the Australian Government asked CSIRO to:
i)

find out whether the 5-star standards have actually reduced heating and cooling energy use of
houses compared with those built to the earlier 3.5 to 4-star standard; and

ii)

determine the actual benefits and costs of meeting the 5-star standard

To undertake this task, CSIRO studied 414 houses in the principal centres of population of three BCA
climate zones over a winter and summer period.

KEY FINDINGS
This report details CSIRO’s response to the above questions. In this report, 5-star (or above) houses are
referred to as higher-rated houses, while houses less than 5-stars were referred to as lower-rated houses.
The findings should be regarded as preliminary, because research work and monitoring is ongoing and
relevant only to the houses that were included in this study (i.e. detached houses built in the last ten years
in Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne). Several factors have made it difficult to draw robust conclusions
about the differences in energy use between lower-rated and higher-rated houses that could be applied to
other such houses across Australia. Some of the factors causing this uncertainty are briefly described
below.
·

The uneven distribution of houses across star rating values in the data set means that the sample
size restricts the conclusions that we can make.

·

The small sample size causes uncertainty about how representative the data set is of Australia’s
households, particularly in relation to household type, occupancy patterns and user behaviour.

·

The above-average temperatures during the summer period make it likely that air-conditioning
appliances were operating at full capacity, regardless of star rating, making it difficult to detect
differences between lower and higher-rated houses.

·

The higher-rated houses were generally constructed more recently than the lower-rated houses,
and further investigation is needed to check whether this caused any inherent bias. For example,
the newer, higher-rated houses were more likely to contain younger children, have someone home
all day, and identify themselves as high energy users.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

13

·

The expected energy ratings of the houses in our sample have not increased in line with the
changes in building regulation. The reasons for this, as well as the quality of build compliance issues
raised by the study, needs to be further examined.

Increased monitoring of houses across Australia will help to provide a clearer picture of the impact of
increasing star ratings on household energy consumption. Data collected through this analysis should also
be compared with alternative data sources to provide a more robust understanding of house performance.
Essentially, our main findings are as follows.
·

The 5-star standard significantly reduced the energy needed to maintain house temperatures in
winter in the houses we studied. As well as saving energy, higher-rated houses were on average
held at a temperature around 1 °C higher than lower-rated houses during winter. It is not clear if
this was because the occupants had set the temperature higher, or whether it was an innate
property of the control system or a result of increased thermal insulation. We estimate in
Section 10.2 that if the temperatures had been the same in both groups (thus comparing on a likefor-like basis), then the average energy per unit of conditioned floor area saved in the winter
season in the post-2006 cohort of higher-rated houses would have been:
o

0.4 kWh m-2 electricity in Brisbane (climate zone 2): 20% reduction (10.2.1)

o

2.7 kWh m-2 electricity in Adelaide (climate zone 5): 39% reduction (10.2.2)

o

29 kWh (104 MJ m-2) gas in Melbourne (climate zone 6): 56% reduction (10.2.3).

Without compensating for the increased warmth of higher-rated houses, the observed average
energy saving for winter was:
o

negligible in Brisbane (climate zone 2) (10.2.1)

o

1.3 kWh m-2 electricity in Adelaide (climate zone 5): 19% reduction (10.2.2)

o

25 kWh m-2 (86 MJ m-2) gas in Melbourne (climate zone 6): 50% reduction (10.2.3).

·

The average cooling energy use in summer was greater in the higher-rated houses in Brisbane and
Melbourne. However, it is not clear whether this was due to the 5-star standard, the make-up of
the house occupancy of higher-rated houses with more children and higher rates of full-time
occupancy, or other behavioural factors. These include the extent of window opening and closing
during summer, and the scale of heat loads from other home appliances and equipment (Chapter
3). There was also no difference in the temperature between the lower and higher-rated houses.
CSIRO is continuing measurement and statistical analysis on the houses included in this study.

·

Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced in winter in higher-rated houses in all cities (Table 9-1).
However, summer emissions increased in higher-rated houses in all cities (Table 9-2). Overall,
greenhouse gas emissions were still reduced by 7% for the higher-rated houses over the year,
despite the summer season increase.

·

Heating costs were reduced and cooling costs increased in higher-rated houses (Table 9-1 and
Table 9-2). The net annual impact was that Brisbane costs were greater in higher-rated houses,
whereas Adelaide and Melbourne costs were lower for the higher-rated houses (Table 9-3). The
reductions in Adelaide were small, but in Melbourne the reduction was a significant (37% or $194
per year).

·

The higher-rated houses cost at least $5000 less in Adelaide and Melbourne for those elements of
the building related to energy efficiency than lower-rated houses, and up to $7000 less in Brisbane.
Increases in the amount of insulation and an apparent shift to more rectangular house design were
the most influential aspects observed in the shift to higher-rated houses.

We conclude that the 5-star standard has produced significant savings in heating energy use in the sample.
However, we need to improve our understanding of summer-time house cooling energy efficiency. The
smaller-than-expected value of the temperature difference between the interior of the house and the
outside environment suggests that additional variables are affecting house cooling compared with house
heating. The relatively small sample size used in analysing some cohorts, particularly in Brisbane, may have
also affected our ability to draw firm conclusions. Identifying and evaluating these variables will enable
architects, building sustainability assessors and equipment designers to provide more thermally efficient
house cooling, as well as advise the public about improving thermal comfort and reducing summer energy
bills. Further analysis of the massive dataset that CSIRO has produced will help to reveal these areas of
potential energy efficiency gains for housing.

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
To provide the data required to answer the questions presented in the Background section, we recruited
and surveyed 414 volunteer households of different star ratings across three cities, in three different BCA
climate zones: Brisbane (Zone 2), Adelaide (Zone 5) and Melbourne (Zone 6). We re-rated each house,
measured inside and outside temperatures, and obtained household energy bills over the study period. We
then selected 209 of these houses to further measure the amount of energy used by heating and cooling
appliances. The study ran from June 2012 (winter) to the end of February 2013 (summer).
We calculated the average energy consumption of two cohorts of houses in each climate zone: those less
than 5 star and those that were 5 stars or greater. To generate meaningful sample sizes for all later
comparisons, the approach taken for clustering houses by star rating was to round up the re-rated star
rating by up to half a star. That is, houses have been deemed to be 5 stars or above if their re-rated star
rating was greater than 4.5 stars. We also used statistical methods to find out how the overall summer and
winter energy use for heating and cooling related to the houses’ star ratings. While the energy savings
quoted above are from the statistical assessment, they are consistent with the averaged measurements
from the two cohorts. Results from both analyses are given in the body of the report.

HEATING AND COOLING ENERGY USE
We analysed the data from the volunteer households to ask whether the 5-star standard actually reduced
heating and cooling energy use in houses compared to those built to the earlier 3.5–4-star standard. In
other words, are higher-rated houses more energy efficient than lower-rated houses?
The type of heating and cooling equipment varied among the houses in the study. Reverse cycle airconditioning (heat pumps) were the dominant heating system in Brisbane and Adelaide, whereas gas
heating was dominant in Melbourne. In Brisbane and Adelaide, heat pumps were the dominant cooling
system. In Melbourne, 40% of houses used evaporative cooling, 40% used heat pumps, and the remaining
20% had no cooling system. As the star rating system does not take into account the type of heating or
cooling appliance, we separated houses into cohorts with the same appliance type when performing
statistical analysis.
Winter heating energy use
Regardless of climate zone or heating system, we found that the higher-rated houses had slightly higher
temperatures than lower-rated houses in the main living area: typically from 0.6 to 0.9 °C higher. This was
unexpected, because we anticipated that temperatures would be the same in all houses. The higher

temperatures could be due to human behaviour, greater insulation, or an innate property of the control
system.
The measurements and statistical analysis provided us with enough information to calculate, at 95%
significance, how much energy was being saved (actual savings), as well as how much additional energy
(inferred savings) could have been saved if the higher-rated houses had been operating at the same
temperature as the lower-star rated houses. From the statistical analysis, the actual and inferred energy
saving in winter for a higher-rated house (compared with a lower-rated house) are given below:
·
·
·

Brisbane: 20% potential savings, if temperatures were kept at the same level as for the lower-rated
houses
Adelaide: 19% actual saving, with an additional 21% potential saving due to the increased
temperature in the higher-rated houses
Melbourne: 50% actual saving, with an additional 6% potential saving due to the increased
temperature in the higher-rated houses.

Summer cooling energy use
Energy consumption was increased in summer in houses with higher star ratings in Brisbane and
Melbourne, while the test results from Adelaide were not statistically significant for a 95% confidence level.
These summer results may have been confounded by the following two factors:
i) cooling equipment running at full capacity during the particularly hot 2012–13 summer months (if
this was the case, then the measured energy consumption is merely an indicator of the installed
capacity of the air conditioners, rather than a measure that can be used to assess the effect of star
rating)
ii) it was not possible to reliably assess the levels of ventilation being used in the houses.
More measurements and a more detailed analysis are needed to resolve these two issues.
Comparing summer cooling and winter energy use
The difference between interior and exterior house temperatures in summer was relatively low compared
with winter. In contrast, heating energy consumption in winter did an effective job of warming the house
above the ambient temperature. This difference between winter heating and summer cooling may be
because houses contain substantial internal sources of heat that place an additional load on cooling in
summer, but assist heating in winter. These might include heat loads, such as ovens, standby 1 power,
televisions and computers; or ambient heat and solar heat that has entered the house and been stored.
Another factor making analysis of these results difficult was the wide variety of cooling methods, such as
ventilation, shade, fans and air conditioners.

BENEFITS AND COSTS
Possible benefits arising from higher-rated houses could include improved occupant comfort, reduced
electricity and gas costs, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We analysed each of these by comparing
the difference between the inside and outside temperature, analysing energy bills, and measuring the
energy used by heating and cooling appliances to determine greenhouse gas emissions, respectively.
In winter, the increased temperature of 0.6–0.9 °C in the higher-rated houses may have improved occupant
comfort. However, a greater energy saving benefit may be realised by householders in higher-rated houses
if their winter-time thermostat settings were lower and closer to the value in lower-rated houses.

Standby is now one of the largest individual electrical end uses in the residential sector (~10%) and is probably equivalent to the energy
consumption of refrigerators and freezers. (Energy Efficient Strategies, October 2006)

When considering whole-of-house energy consumption, cost reductions were observed in Adelaide and
Melbourne for higher-rated houses, with a 3% reduction in costs in Adelaide and a 13% reduction in
Melbourne. Brisbane houses effectively remained the same (Table 8-3).
When considering heating/cooling appliance energy consumption, we did not see a reduction in electricity
costs in higher-rated houses compared with lower-rated houses. It is possible that energy saved from
heating higher-rated houses was used elsewhere, for example, to maintain higher temperatures in the
house. In houses with gas heating, the gas consumption was 52% less in higher-rated houses than in lowerrated houses (Table 9-1).
In winter, average greenhouse gas emissions from heating appliances were reduced in higher-rated houses
compared with lower-rated houses: by 50% in Melbourne, 9% in Adelaide and 13% in Brisbane. In summer,
preliminary (not statistically significant) results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions may be increased for
the higher-rated houses in all cities: by 37% in Melbourne, 11% in Adelaide and 28% in Brisbane. The result
in Melbourne was affected by the high emission factor of brown coal-fired power stations.
As well as the measured energy saved due to the 5-star rating, there were also potential savings to be
made due to the increased temperatures in higher-rated houses. Overall, the improved insulation in higherrated houses appears to have the potential to save energy and greenhouse gas emissions in winter, but
makes little difference in summer.
In the RIS, the costs of meeting the 5-star standard were expected to be more than for lower-rated houses.
However, our results show that based on the sampled house designs, it has actually been less expensive to
meet the 5-star standard than the previous standard. The average cost for those elements of a building that
are related to achieving the star rating were $7,500 less in Brisbane, $5,500 less in Adelaide and $5,000 less
in Melbourne. This was mainly because of an observed shift to more rectangular floor plans; leading to a
larger floor area per unit of wall and glazing (the window-to-wall area ratio was similar). Although the cost
of insulation rose, this was outweighed by the savings made on walls and windows. The cause for these
changes in design may be due to factors unrelated to the star rating, but their inclusion affects the star
rating and the cost of the building.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER WORK
Overall, this research has shown that a great deal of further measurement and analysis is required to
enable effective decisions about the future of house cooling energy efficiency in Australia. We have
amassed an extremely large data set, which has so far been only partially analysed. More research is
required to unlock learnings from this data.
For example, the current study focused on averaged seasonal data sets, rather than on what happens in
specific circumstances. Analysing subsets of data from particular time periods under particular search
conditions may help to reduce uncertainty by eliminating irrelevant data. It would also help answer a range
of additional questions. For example, under what conditions do people turn on their air conditioners? What
room temperatures are being achieved when the air conditioner is switched on?
More contextual data may also need to be gathered from the sample houses and occupants to better
understand the key drivers of heating and cooling energy use. Maintaining the existing cohort of houses
presents Australia with the opportunity to create a register of monitored test houses for future studies.
More research is also required to compare the energy performance of individual houses using the Chenath
thermal modelling engine, which forms the basis of the rating tools accredited under NatHERS. Predictions
from the Chenath engine should be done under as-occupied assumptions, rather than rating assumptions.
This would help to further validate the NatHERS benchmark calculation engine and provide a basis for
identifying key house design sensitivities.
The data should also be used to explore a range of industry issues, such as:

Part I Background and
methodology

1 Assessment approach
1.1 Background
In 2011, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (subsequently abolished, with its energy
efficiency functions transferred to the Department of Industry) commissioned the Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to ascertain the actual benefits and costs resulting from the
introduction of the 5-star energy efficiency standard for housing from 2006 in the Building Code of Australia
(BCA). In particular, this study addresses two research questions:
1. How effective has the standard been in reducing actual (not simulated) conditioning energy use
(heating and cooling) relative to houses constructed to earlier energy efficiency standards, specified
as between 3.5–4 stars in the 2003–2005 releases of the BCA?
2. What are the actual benefits and associated costs of the 5-star standard relative to the 3.5–4 star
standard, in terms of construction costs, avoidable energy costs, heating and cooling appliance
costs, and total lifetime costs?

1.2 Scope
The impact of the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) rating on energy consumption was
assessed by comparing NatHERS star ratings against measurements of energy consumed by heating and
cooling appliances in 209 households across Melbourne (BCA climate zone 6), Adelaide (BCA climate zone
5) and Brisbane (BCA climate zone 2). An additional 205 houses were assessed for supporting information
using NatHERS ratings, energy bills and surveys. This report covers the assessment’s methodology,
assumptions, results and key outcomes. It also makes recommendations for ongoing work and suggestions
to further improve the standard.
This assessment was carried out across 414 houses in climate zones 2, 5 and 6. It took into account the
following parameters:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

building design, construction and particular energy efficiency measures
half-hourly measures of internal and external air temperature and external dewpoint
half-hourly measures of total electricity consumption and heating and cooling appliance electricity
consumption
heating and cooling appliance efficiency
estimates of cost saving to the householder and cost to the builder
estimates of greenhouse gas emissions
measures of human behaviour that might offset or support energy consumption

The scope of work required to achieve this objective included:
·
·
·
·
·

identifying houses with a high probability of a star rating in the required range
recruiting 414 householder volunteers, which required screening approximately 800 applications
obtaining access to 414 house plans from local councils or architects, and where available, energy
rating reports
interviewing all householders on site and then following up using a website questionnaire
installing and maintaining temperature sensors in 414 houses and energy monitoring equipment in
209 houses

·
·

inspecting each house for quality of the efficiency measures and to characterise heating and
cooling appliances
carrying out a NatHERS star rating assessment on each house
obtaining electricity and gas bills from the energy retailer for each household
managing data acquisition, data security, data integrity, analysis and reporting

A full description of the methodology is in Appendix A.

1.3 Implementing the methodology
1.3.1 VOLUNTEER HOUSE SELECTION
The study recruited 414 households across three distinct climate zones as determined by the BCA. The
climate zones were Zone 2, Zone 5 and Zone 6, as shown in Figure 1-1, which correspond to the major
population centres. Zone 2 encompasses Brisbane and much of Queensland’s coastline south of the Tropic
of Capricorn. Zone 5 covers Sydney, Adelaide and Perth, while Zone 6 covers most of the populated areas of
Victoria, including Melbourne. Consequently, house selection focused around major growth areas in the
south-east Queensland area and growth areas of Adelaide, Melbourne and Geelong. New South Wales was
excluded from the study, due to its use of BASIX to assess houses for building approval, rather than
NatHERS. Perth has been excluded due to its distance from the east coast (which would lead to travel cost
increases) and the predominance of double brick houses, which could lead to a bias in the results being
applied to other houses in the same climate zone.
Houses selected were required to have been subjected to the energy efficiency provisions of the BCA that
were first introduced in 2003. Consequently, this put a 10-year age constraint on the houses included in
this study. The various states and territories brought in their requirements for the energy efficiency
provisions at different times, so the level of performance required varied between regions at a given point
in time.
Volunteer recruitment aimed to obtain an even distribution of houses across star ratings ranging from 3 to
5 stars. It was not possible to predetermine star ratings for the houses during the recruitment phase, so
date of construction was used as a proxy for star rating. All recruited houses were then re-rated to
determine their actual star rating, and this was used as the basis for the star rating analysis. Appendix A
(A.3.4) provides a comprehensive analysis of the statistical distribution of star ratings within each subgroup
tested.

1.3.2 HOUSE SURVEYS
Each volunteer household underwent two surveys: a household survey completed by the occupant, and a
house audit survey completed by an Association of Building Sustainability Assessors (ABSA)-accredited
assessor who visited the property. The household survey focused on the occupant’s perceptions of the
energy efficiency aspects of their house and their actions and attitudes towards energy efficiency. The
house audit focused on the physical characteristics of the house, including the quality of insulation install,
the type of heating/cooling appliances, hot water units and lighting systems being used, and the presence
or absence of weather sealing.
Correct 3levels of insulation and proper installation were checked through two main methods. First, a
physical inspection (where possible) was undertaken to determine the type of insulation used, including an
estimate of its R rating. Where physical inspection was not possible, thermal imaging determined insulation
effectiveness and coverage. In most houses, physical inspection of ceiling insulation was possible, but this
was not possible for wall insulation. Thermal imaging of all houses confirmed whether insulation was
installed correctly.
The BCA assumes a certain level of air tightness in buildings. This is achieved through weather sealing strips,
door and window seals, plugging gaps in walls and self-closing seals on exhaust fans. The actual airtightness level of a building can be determined through a blower door test, which pressurises the building
and measures air exchange rates. Blower door tests, along with physical inspection of sealing methods,
were undertaken in 20 houses in Melbourne to determine the general level of compliance with the BCA
assumptions.

1.3.3 ACCURATE RE-RATING
All houses in the study were re-rated by ABSA-accredited assessors using the latest version of the NatHERS
benchmark rating tool, AccuRate (v1.1.4.1). The NatHERS rating values were determined using a rigorous
and standardised re-rating process, audited by ABSA, and with one assessor per climate zone. Full details
are provided in Appendix B . Original house plans and BCA Energy Efficiency compliance paperwork was
obtained from the home owner or local council where available. Figure 1-2 gives an overview of the
distribution of data from the cohort of 209 households that originally had electricity data loggers, and the
414 volunteers whose houses had temperature sensors, rating assessments and surveys.
Table 1-1 lists the breakdown of the recruited volunteers by their climate zone, their city and their
AccuRate star rating. The table also shows the number of active houses still being monitored by CSIRO, and
the number of houses that have dropped out of the study in each climate zone.

1.3.4 NATHERS CLIMATE ZONES
Although climate zones as determined by the BCA were the primary climate categorisation, NatHERS makes
use of a much more refined climate zone categorisation with 69 climate zones. Within this study, ten
different NatHERS climate zones were represented and used during the AccuRate re-rating process.
Figure 1-3 shows the distribution of houses by their star rating and their NatHERS climate zone. Climate
zones 9 and 10 are located in Brisbane, climate zones 16 and 59 are in Adelaide, and climate zones 21, 27,
and 60–64 are in Melbourne.

1.3.5 DATA COLLECTION
Data collection activities included:
·
·
·
·

internal temperature monitoring of all houses
monitoring of electricity consumption in half the houses in each climate zone
whole-of-house energy billing data (electricity and gas) from all houses (where available)
Bureau of Meteorology temperature and dew point data for local weather stations

Where houses had their electricity monitored, the heating and cooling electricity consumption and
associated temperatures were measured at half-hourly intervals. This was carried out for the nine-month
study period from June 2012 to February 2013 (summer, autumn and winter). Daily gas consumption was
assessed from gas billing data.

1.3.6 ELECTRICITY AND TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS
Temperature was measured and collected in each house using Thermochron button cell data loggers
(Figure 1-4). These were installed in a reasonably well-ventilated area of the main living area, on a wall high
enough to be out of reach of young children and pets, and away from any direct source of cooling or
heating. Measurements were taken at 30-minute intervals (using two sensors with alternating hourly
recordings) and sensors were changed over every 80 days. Figure 1-5 shows a typical data output from one
of the Thermochron sensors.

Figure 1-5

Typical internal temperature data profile from Thermochron sensors

Total energy consumption, together with heating and cooling energy consumption, was measured and
collected in half the houses using an eight channel EcoPulse data logger. The data logger measured the
current and voltage for up to eight sub-circuits and power factor at the main circuit in the house mains
switch board. Total energy was calculated by summing all non-solar sub circuits. Figure 1-6 shows a typical
EcoPulse installation, which also includes the use of a timer to reset the unit each day, and a Wi-Fi router
and 3G modem to allow remote access for data downloads and ongoing maintenance checks.

1.3.7 DATA COMMUNICATION
Data was gathered at the EcoPulse unit and then transferred using a secure internet connection to a CSIRO
database. Volunteers were promised access to a secure internet web page at the end of the assessment.
This allows each household to monitor their home energy consumption (Figure 1-7). The same web page
was used for rapid surveying of energy use patterns, which allowed us to determine characteristic signals in
heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) appliance power circuits.

Figure 1-7

28

1.3.8 DATA STORAGE AND VALIDATION
Data storage for the electrical measurements was at three levels:
·
·
·

local data storage at the data logger, updated every half-hour
central data storage at a secure CSIRO server, updated twice a day
a complete data download from the household units, updated three times during the nine-month
monitoring period

Data summary logs were inspected twice daily. This allowed for a fast response to equipment failures at
any household.

1.3.9 ANALYSIS OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND HOUSE THERMAL EFFICIENCY
Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate factors for the energy consumption dependence on
NatHERS star rating, temperature and other variables. This allowed us to estimate the actual and potential
savings resulting from application of the 5-star standard.
The calculation of house heating and cooling energy consumption reductions was considered in two parts:
(i) energy consumption dependence on star rating, and (ii) energy that could potentially be saved due to
temperature dependence on star rating. The second component was necessary because the analysis found
a significant increase in the temperature difference in houses with higher star ratings. This is described in
detail in 10.1 and in the Methodology in A.3.

1.3.10 ANALYSIS OF COSTS DATA
Building costs
To estimate the costs incurred in achieving the various star-rating standards, the analysis only focused on
those elements of the building that are directly related to the star rating, being:
·
·
·
·
·
·

window area
window orientation
glazing material
floor, wall and roof materials
wall area
insulation

Additional sustainability measures that may be required by other aspects of the BCA or by various state,
territory or local governments were not included. This included solar hot water systems, low-energy
lighting, rainwater tanks and ceiling fans.
The quantities for the various materials were derived from the AccuRate assessments of each house in the
study. AccuRate requires material details for external and internal walls, floor, ceiling, roof and insulation,
as well as location and type of windows. The quantities of materials were calculated for every house in the
study and then costed using Rawlinsons Construction Cost Guide (Rawlinsons, 2011). Costs for all houses
are based on 2011 prices.
The average conditioned area of the sample of higher-rated houses was less than the average conditioned
area of the sample of lower-rated houses. This could lead to a skewed cost comparison, because the total
cost for a smaller house will often be less than a comparable larger house. To account for this, lower-rated
houses that had a conditioned space greater than 230m2 were excluded. This resulted in the average
conditioned area of all houses being within ±5% within each city.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

29

Finally, several assumptions were made to allow cost comparisons.
·
·
·
·
·

Expanded polystyrene in a floor was considered to be a waffle pod.
The cost of waffle pod concrete slab and standard in-ground concrete slab was considered to be
the same, so no cost difference was calculated.
All windows (both single and double-glazed) were considered to be awning windows.
All external walls were considered to be brick veneer with timber stud and painted plasterboard.
All wall and ceiling insulation was considered to be glasswool batts of the specified R value.

Operational and greenhouse costs
To determine the benefits of the higher star rating using the results obtained for the houses in each climate
zone, our analysis included estimates of:
·

savings to date in gas and electricity consumption

·

greenhouse gas savings to date (measured as CO2-e)

Standard energy tariff rates in each city were used to calculate the energy costs for households.
The greenhouse gas emissions impact of household energy used the factors given in the ‘National
Greenhouse Accounts Factors – July 2012’ (Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, 2012) for
each city.

2 Overview of data – house
2.1 House types
The vast majority of houses recruited for the study were detached dwellings. There were 20 semi-detached
townhouse-style dwellings, but no flats, units or apartments, because the study only covered BCA Class 1
residential buildings. All houses were constructed in the past 10 years, because houses built earlier than
this would not have been subject to the energy efficiency provisions of the BCA. Figure 2-1 shows the
distribution of building approval year for the volunteer households in this study, while Figure 2-2 shows the
percentage of each. A relatively even spread of years has been achieved across all cities. For a small
number of houses, the exact year of construction was unknown, because no dates were visible on the plans
that were made available.

The size of the houses and number of bedrooms reflects the move to larger houses that has been occurring
over the past decade. Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 show that 63% of houses in the study have four or more
bedrooms, although in Brisbane this figure is 85%. By comparison, the latest census data for Australia
reveals that only 30.3% of households in the country have four or more bedrooms. The census data
includes flats and units, but nevertheless, detached and semi-detached dwellings still represent the vast
majority of Australian houses (85.5%).

2.2 Star rating
As part of the project, all houses were re-rated using AccuRate. The ratings undertaken relied on details
obtained from the planning documentation. Where sufficient information was not available, assumptions
have been made. These assumptions, and the methodology applied in rating these houses, are detailed in
the AccuRate Rating Methodology document prepared by Energy Makeovers (see Appendix B ).
Figure 2-6 shows the ratings distribution for the three cities after the re-rating. Very few houses rate at or
above 6 stars. Even at the 5 stars and above level, the numbers are low, with only 15% of houses in
Brisbane rating at 5+ stars. The best-performing city was Adelaide, with 34% of houses rating at 5 or more
stars. Conversely, Brisbane has a large percentage of houses (57%) rated below 4 stars, while in Adelaide
and Melbourne, around 17% of houses were rated below 4 stars.

The difference between the cities reflects the staged introduction of energy efficiency provisions in each
city (Error! Reference source not found.). In Brisbane, where requirements for 5-star houses were only
introduced in 2009 (previously the requirement had been 3.5 stars), we would expect a lower number of
higher-rated houses. In Adelaide, requirements for 5-star houses were introduced in 2006 (previously the
requirement had been 4 stars), while in Melbourne, the 5-star provisions were introduced in 2004
(previously the requirement had been 3 stars). From 2011, all the areas covered by this study require a 6
star minimum, although Brisbane allows up to 1.5 star credits for outdoor living areas and photovoltaic
generation systems.
Although the year of introduction of the energy requirements in each state gives some indication of the
expected minimum rating for a particular house built in a particular year, it is not a guarantee. Building
permits can be issued based on plans that were prepared prior to an increase in the minimum
requirements; often, this is left to the discretion of the building permit issuer. It is possible that a building
constructed in a particular year was actually issued a building permit based on the energy requirements in
place one or two years before construction commenced.

To generate meaningful sample sizes for all later comparisons, the approach taken for clustering houses by
star rating was to round up the re-rated star rating by up to half a star. That is, houses have been deemed
to be 5 stars or above if their re-rated star rating was greater than 4.5 stars. This was deemed appropriate
when taking into account that: i) when built, houses would have been rated with older versions of any of
the current NatHERS tools, or been approved under the deemed to satisfy (DTS) provisions of the BCA and
not rated at all; and ii) the known variance that occurs among assessors and the conservative rigour applied
in the standardised re-rating approach of this study. This led to an increase in the sample size of 5 star or
more houses. In Brisbane in particular, only 21 houses rated at 5 stars or more with the original re-rating.
Incorporating houses that rated at or above 4.5 stars increased the count to 39 houses (Figure 2-9).

Figure 2-5 indicated that the average floor area for volunteer households was around 201 m2. However,
when examined within the star-rating cohorts, the higher-rating houses are below this average, at 189 m2,
while the lower-rated houses are slightly larger, at 214 m2. Figure 2-11 shows the distribution of floor areas
based on the star rating. When the very large (>400 m2) houses were removed from the analysis, the floor
area of typical houses was much the same between the lower and higher-rated cohorts.

2.3 Heating and cooling appliances
2.3.1 HEATING SYSTEM
Figure 2-12 shows that based on the assessor’s audit, 77% of houses in Melbourne have gas heating,
compared with 19% and 1% in Adelaide and Brisbane, respectively. In Adelaide and Brisbane, heating is
predominantly provided through reverse-cycle systems: 73% in Adelaide and 88% in Brisbane. It is
interesting to note that 4% of houses in Brisbane had no fixed heating system. Figure 2-13 shows heating
systems in houses by star rating. The higher-rated houses have a higher use of gas heating. However, this is
more a result of the higher proportion of higher-rated homes being located in Melbourne, where gas
heating is dominant, rather than a shift to gas heating as a result of energy efficiency improvements.

2.3.2 COOLING SYSTEM
In Adelaide and Brisbane, reverse-cycle systems are commonly used for both heating and cooling
requirements. Figure 2-14 shows that 92% of houses in Brisbane use reverse-cycle systems for cooling, with
the remaining 8% having no fixed cooling system. In Adelaide, 80% of houses use reverse-cycle systems and
17% use evaporative cooling. Only 4% of Adelaide houses had no fixed cooling system, lower than the
percentage in Brisbane. Melbourne houses are equally split between evaporative and reverse-cycle
systems, with around 82% of houses using either technology. The remaining 18% of Melbourne houses
have no fixed cooling system. Figure 2-15 shows cooling systems in houses by star rating. Like the heating
systems, the breakdown in cooling appliances is more a result of the higher number of higher-rated houses
being located in Melbourne, rather than differences in the type of cooling system. Consequently, increases
in evaporative coolers and houses with no cooling systems, and a decrease in the number of reverse-cycle
units, are to be expected.

3 Overview of data – household
3.1 Occupant type
The majority of households are families with one or more children (Figure 3-1). Around 15% of households
are retirees (either single or couples) and 21% are working couples with no children.

Little difference in household profile existed between the star bands (see Figure 3-2), although slightly
more families with younger children (preschool or school age) lived in higher-rated houses than lowerrated houses, with more families with adult children living in the lower-rated houses. This would suggest
that as families have grown they have moved into new houses, and stayed in those houses as the family
aged.

3.3

Energy efficiency attitudes

Establishing household attitudes and actions towards energy efficiency in the home is important in
determining behavioural impacts on overall energy consumption. The way people operate their houses,
and the attention to the energy being consumed, help to explain differences that may be evident in
seemingly similar dwellings and occupants. For example, the energy needed to heat a building will increase
in winter if windows or doors are left open whereas controlled ventilation can reduce a building’s cooling
energy consumption in summer. Likewise, heating and cooling energy can be significantly higher or lower
depending on the thermostat settings an occupant uses.

3.3.1 ENERGY USE
Figure 3-5 indicates that the majority of households have some level of awareness of their energy
consumption, with less than 4% indicating that they did not know if their household energy consumption
had changed over the last 12 months. Most households (41%) had seen no change over the last year, while
25% believed it had increased and 30% believed it had decreased. Interestingly, more households in the
higher-rated houses believed their energy consumption had increased than those households in the lowerrated houses (Figure 3-6), and fewer higher-rated households indicated a decrease in energy consumption
than those in the lower-rated houses.

For the households that believed their energy use had increased, most indicated that lifestyle changes were
a major factor (Figure 3-7). This could include the arrival of a newborn child, or moving into retirement and
thus being at home more often. Increases in the number of appliances (such as larger televisions) and
changes in the weather were also cited as major reasons.

Stated reasons why household energy use increased

In households that had seen an energy decrease, the major reason cited was an active effort to reduce
consumption (Figure 3-8). Sixty-three per cent of volunteers also indicated that cost savings associated with
energy reduction was a major factor, with 39% saying they had replaced old, inefficient appliances with
more energy-efficient appliances.
The economic benefits associated with reduced energy expenditure are seen by most households as the
primary driver for reducing energy consumption (Figure 3-9). Concern for the environment was also a major
reason for reducing energy consumption, with 70% citing this as a reason.

3.3.2 ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOUSEHOLDS
Many people are aware that their house was built to an energy efficiency standard. However, some
confusion remains in the marketplace about what is included within the energy efficiency provisions.
Figure 3-10 lists the features identified by occupants that improve energy efficiency. Overall, 96%
acknowledged that they had ceiling insulation, while a further 75% believed they had wall insulation.
Perceptions on energy-efficient lighting are worth noting, with 73% of households in Melbourne and 66% in
Adelaide indicating that they had efficient lighting, despite 81% in both cities actually having inefficient
halogen lamps installed. Curious to note also is that 28% of households in Melbourne indicated they have
double glazing, yet the assessors reported that only 14% of houses had double glazing. This discrepancy
may be due to some houses having a small number of double-glazed windows, while the majority of their
windows are single-glazed. Builders often include some double-glazed windows to achieve the required star
rating.

Awareness of energy efficiency features by star rating

Despite apparent increases or little change in a household’s energy consumption, 91% still indicated that
they are taking steps to reduce their energy consumption. As has been seen, changes in lifestyle can often
affect energy consumption, despite efforts to reduce consumption. Figure 3-12 shows that most people
believe that they are medium energy users (57%), while 30% believe they are low energy users. Figure 3-13
shows that twice as many households in the higher-rated cohort considered themselves high energy users
compared with the lower-rated cohort. Figure 3-14 shows that 78% believe they are fairly or very mindful
of their energy consumption, while 17% are extremely mindful. Figure 3-15 shows that energy use
awareness was similar between the two star-rating cohorts.
Figure 3-16 and Figure 3-17 show the household response to the statement “We are an energy conserving
household” by city and star-rating cohort. Both figures show that most households agree with the
statement. Those households that strongly agree with the statement are slightly more likely to be in
Adelaide. Very few households disagreed with the statement, while none strongly disagreed. A significant
proportion remained neutral.

Part 2 Key Outcomes

4 Meeting the star rating
One of the problems encountered while gathering information for this study was the lack of documented
evidence about how volunteer houses had met the required energy efficiency standard. All the houses
selected would have been subject to some aspect of the regulation and would have been required to
demonstrate this to have received a building permit. However, the lack of record keeping for this process
has made it difficult to determine the exact methodology used.
In most jurisdictions, builders could choose to either have the house rated by an assessor using one of the
NatHERS certified software tools, or they could comply through DTS provisions. In many cases, the DTS
provisions were the popular choice, because they were prescriptive solutions and easy to implement at a
relatively low cost to the builder. Figure 4-1 shows the percentage of houses in each city for which the
original NatHERS-based star ratings were available, and the method that was used to achieve the rating.
Around 30% of houses in Brisbane and Adelaide had ratings available, while the percentage was higher in
Melbourne, at 56%.
It cannot be assumed that the houses for which ratings were not available used DTS provisions. The only
holders of energy efficiency compliance data were either the local council or the home owner. The quality
of local council records varied considerably, and in many cases no house records (or very limited records)
were available.

Figure 4-2

Original star rating of houses (where ratings available)

Figure 4-2 shows the star-rating range within each city for the houses with available original star ratings.
Like Figure 2-9, Figure 4-2 also reflects the staged introduction of energy efficiency provisions in each city,
but shows a higher proportion of higher-rated houses than was seen in the AccuRate re-rating process.
Figure 4-3 compares the original rating and the re-rating, revealing that the re-rated star rating of a
significant proportion of houses was below their original rating, even allowing for a half-star tolerance.

A total of 174 houses from the sample group were available for this comparison. Adelaide was the best
performing, yet still had 43% of houses rating below their original rating; in Brisbane and Melbourne,
around 50% of the houses were re-rated below their original rating. Overall, 7.5% of houses had an original
star rating that was above the re-rated value.
Caution is needed in interpreting these results. For earlier houses, the original NatHERS rating was done
with an earlier version of the NatHERS software than the version used for re-rating, which may lead to a
lower rating result. The assessment protocols used by the assessors have also changed over time.
Differences in the methodologies utilised by assessors are known to occur, which may lead to variation in
results.
Figure 4-4, Figure 4-5 and Figure 4-6 show the star rating comparison for each city at half-star increments.
In all cities, the original rating is biased to be higher than the re-rated assessment. For example, in Brisbane,
11% of houses had an original rating of 6.5 stars or more, yet the re-rating saw no houses rate over 6.4
stars, and only 2% of houses rate between 6 and 6.4 stars. Likewise, in Adelaide and Melbourne, higherrated houses were rare in the re-rating process. Only 1.6% and 7.4% of houses rated 6 stars or better in
Adelaide and Melbourne, respectively, compared with 20.8% (Adelaide) and 26.5% (Melbourne) rating 6
stars or better in the original rating.

Star rating comparison for Melbourne

Figure 4-7 shows the same star rating comparison as Figures 4-4 to 4-6, but based on the year of building
approval, rather than city. As the star rating requirements have increased, the percentage of houses that
rated below their original rating has also increased. Of the 31 houses in the study built in 2010, 71% were
below their original rating when re-rated, compared with 33% of houses built in 2003.

Figure 4-8 shows the increase in star rating over the study period for each of the cities. As would be
expected, the average star rating has increased over the study period in each city, although the rate of
increase varies. Melbourne has seen the biggest improvement, with an average 1.5-star improvement over
the nine years. Adelaide and Brisbane have had similar improvements of 0.5 stars; however, Adelaide has
had a consistently higher average star rating than the other two cities, especially Brisbane.

Average star rating by city and year

Although re-rated houses may have often rated below their original rating, this does not necessarily mean
they were rated below that required by the regulations. For example, a house that originally rated at 5.5
stars and re-rated at 5.1 stars would still achieve the required rating of 5.0 stars. It is difficult to determine
the precise star rating that a particular house was required to achieve, because this is determined by the
date of building approval, which does not always correspond to the date listed on the plan. However, if we
assume, for example, that a house that was originally rated between 5.0 and 5.9 stars was required to
achieve 5 stars, then comparisons can be made. Using this assumption and allowing for a half-star
tolerance, 59% of houses achieved a rating within their star band when re-rated. However, this varied
within the star bands, as shown in Figure 4-9. Eighty-eight per cent of houses in the 4.0–4.9 star band
achieved this rating when re-rated, while for the higher-rated houses, only 36% of houses originally rated at
6 stars or more were re-rated at the same level. This corresponds with the findings in Figure 4-7, which
show that as the rating requirements have increased, the level of compliance has decreased.

5 Construction compliance
An important aspect of this study has been establishing how well houses built since the introduction of
energy efficiency provisions have met the requirement. Houses are rated at the time of design, and many
of the aspects required as part of the energy efficiency provisions are hard to check and verify postconstruction. Consequently, many building inspectors will be unable to establish if wall insulation, for
example, has actually been installed. Other issues, such as the air tightness of the house, are almost
impossible to establish without undertaking specific tests.
Visual inspection of certain aspects can help to establish a degree of confidence in compliance. For this
study, trained assessors inspected a range of items in each house and assessed their quality. The following
results are based on the findings of the visual inspections.

5.1 Ceiling insulation
Ceiling insulation is probably one of the easiest energy efficiency aspects to inspect. A range of insulation
products are available and they need to be properly installed to ensure their optimum performance. Ceiling
insulation was inspected for type, thickness of coverage (if applicable) and quality of installation. Figure 5-1
lists the various insulation materials found in use. Glasswool batts were by far the most common ceiling
insulation material used, with reflective foil and anticon blankets common in many Brisbane houses.

The general condition of ceiling insulation is shown in Figure 5-2. Overall, the condition of the insulation
was rated as good or average. Only a small percentage was found to be in poor condition, the worst being
in 16% of houses in Melbourne. The higher-rated houses showed a slightly lower level of poor installs than
the lower-rated houses (8.6% compared with 11.4%, respectively; see Figure 5-3).

Condition of ceiling insulation by star rating

Thermal inspection of ceilings and walls helped to determine the quality of the insulation install and
identify gaps in coverage. Thermal imaging was particularly useful in areas where access to the roof space
was unavailable or difficult.
Figure 5-4 is an example of the thermal inspection showing gaps in the ceiling insulation coverage. The
image on the right shows the large gap in insulation (dark area) around a downlight (whitish patch).
Downlights present a particular issue, because clearance is required around these fixtures as part of
AS/NZS 3000. The standard requires horizontal clearances from thermal insulation in ceilings of 50 mm for
an incandescent downlight and 200 mm for a halogen downlight. However, in practice, the requirements of
AS/NZS 3000 mean that insulation installers often leave out half a batt (450 mm x 450 mm) around each
halogen downlight. Halogen downlights are typically installed at one per 2.5 m2, meaning that in a 10 m2
room, 0.81 m2 of the ceiling is uninsulated. The heat lost through the uninsulated part of the ceiling will
double the heat lost through the whole ceiling. This would reduce the effective R value of R3.5 insulation to

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

R1.2. 2
Downlight covers are available that may allow insulation to be installed up to the side of the cover.
However, these are rarely used.

5.2 Weather sealing
Good-quality weather sealing is important to reduce leakage of conditioned air from the house; it also
reduces the amount of external air entering the house. Regulations require that windows and external
doors be weather stripped. Weather stripping is a fairly simple technique, but can be easily damaged by the
opening and closing of doors and windows, reducing its effectiveness. Assessors checked for weather
sealing on windows and external doors. Most windows were found to have adequate weather stripping,
although 6% of the Adelaide houses had none (Figure 5-5). Between the star-rating cohorts, a reduction in
the number of houses without weather stripping was identified, down to 2.3% for higher-rated houses
from 6.2% for the lower-rated houses (Figure 5-6).
External doors had a lower level of adequate sealing, with only 35% of the Melbourne houses having
adequate sealing (Figure 5-7). In Adelaide, 60% of houses had complete weather seals on their external
doors. Most houses had some degree of weather sealing, and again only a small percentage had none. As
with window sealing, improvements were seen between the star-rating cohorts, with only 7.7% of higherrating houses having no sealing, down from 10.4% for the lower-rated houses (Figure 5-8). The high use of
doors may explain the degree of only partial stripping, because some may have been damaged and
removed over time. This requires further investigation.

5.3 Pressure testing
Blower door air pressure testing is an effective way of determining the ‘leakiness’ of a house and helps to
determine if the house has been adequately sealed. Each test was conducted according to the ATTMA TS1
standard. The houses were depressurised at different pressures in a 15–60 Pa range and were tested with
all external, operable doors and windows closed. Unfortunately, pressure testing is expensive and only
limited funds were available for these tests. Consequently, a sample of 20 houses in Melbourne was
selected for testing.
The NatHERS software does not specifically define the level of air tightness that is to be achieved, but
certain assumed values are used. The rate of 15 air changes per hour (ACH) when the house is pressurised
to 50 Pa is considered an average value, with better-sealed houses performing at around 10 ACH @50 Pa. It
is interesting to note that the European PassivHaus standard requires houses to achieve a rate of 0.6 ACH
@50 Pa: 33 times lower than the average of 19.7 ACH @50 Pa measured for the 20 houses in this study.
Table 5-1 lists the results of the flow rate measured at 50 Pa pressure for each house. Only one house
achieved a result below 10 m3/hr @50 Pa, which is considered to be good sealing, while around half
achieved close to 15 m3/hr @50 Pa, which is considered average sealing. Of concern are the 20% of houses
that exceeded 30 m3/hr @50 Pa. This level of performance is generally found in old, poorly designed houses
and would not be expected in houses built within the past 10 years. In addition, as these houses were all
located in Melbourne, none were rated below 4 stars.

Despite the higher-than-expected pressure test results, when the results were organised by year of building
approval, they showed that over time the trend has been to improve air tightness in houses (Figure 5-10).
This is an encouraging trend, which shows that the best-performing houses were also the most recently
constructed.

Relationship between year of building approval and pressure test results

Analysis was also conducted to see if any relationship existed between the star rating of the houses and
their pressure results: i.e., were homes with higher star ratings achieving better pressure results. No
relationship was identified.

5.4 Internal temperatures
The internal temperatures of all houses in the study were monitored by sensors located in the main living
space. The data were used to estimate the internal comfort that households were experiencing in relation
to the outside temperature. Temperature data could also be used as an indicator of possible thermostat
settings that were being applied. In this respect, it is worth noting that comparisons can be made between
the actual internal temperatures that are being set, and the assumed temperature settings that are applied
through the NatHERS software. NatHERS uses a fixed comfort range to determine when heating or cooling
is required.
Figure 5-11, Figure 5-12 and Figure 5-13 show the average internal temperatures for each city at various
times of the day. The most informative is the average internal temperature experienced in the evening
(6:00–10:00 pm), a period in which the majority of houses would be occupied and heating/cooling systems
in operation if required. The figures also indicate the assumed NatHERS comfort band, which is different for
each city. In Brisbane, for example, houses were up to 1.6 °C warmer than NatHERS assumes in February,
whereas in Adelaide during July, the average internal temperature was a degree cooler than NatHERS
assumes.
Several reasons may account for these differences. For example, the heating/cooling system may have
been running at capacity and unable to achieve the comfort band; or, households may have chosen to

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

allow their house to be slightly warmer or cooler than NatHERS assumes. We recommend that this
phenomenon be investigated further to better determine the actual cause.

6 Construction techniques for achieving compliance
Builders have used a variety of methods to achieve the NatHERS energy efficiency standards. We analysed
the AccuRate assessments of all houses in the study to identify these methods, and the changes that have
occurred to achieve the higher standards: that is, the shift from 3.5-4 stars to 5 stars or more. The AccuRate
assessments listed all the major building materials used in the building envelope, including any insulation
materials. The area, location and thermal performance of these materials were also recorded.
Consequently, a detailed picture of how residential houses have achieved their required star rating
performance has been obtained for each of the three cities in the study.
Essentially, builders used the following methods to achieve the energy efficiency standards:
· insulation to ceilings
· insulation to walls (external and internal)
· insulation to concrete slab floors
· double-glazed windows
· window orientation
· changes to overall glazing area
Our analysis of the changes within each city for each cohort of NatHERS-rated houses has provided an
indication of the most popular methods chosen by builders to achieve the required rating.

6.1 Ceiling insulation
The thermal performance level of ceiling insulation varied by city and changed between the star-rating
cohorts (Table 6-1). Brisbane houses predominantly have R1.5 or R2.5 ceiling insulation, with increasing use
of R2.5 in the higher-rated houses and a corresponding decrease in R1.5. Adelaide predominantly has R2.5
or R3.0 ceiling insulation, while in Melbourne, the higher-rated insulation (R3.5 and R4.0) dominates in the
higher-rated houses.

6.2 External wall insulation
The use of external wall insulation is common in the heating-dominated cities (Adelaide and Melbourne),
but is rarely employed in Brisbane: even within the higher-rated cohort, where 80% of all external walls
have no insulation (Table 6-2). In Adelaide, 82% of the external walls in higher-rated houses have
insulation, while the rate is 75% in Melbourne. This is up from around 60% of external walls in lower-rated
in both Adelaide and Melbourne. R1.5 or R2.0 is the most common insulation level installed.

6.3 Internal wall insulation
Internal wall insulation is still uncommon in houses in all of the cities within the study, including houses in
the 5-star cohorts. In Brisbane, internal wall insulation is virtually never used, while Adelaide has the
greatest use of internal wall insulation, with 19% of walls in lower-rated houses containing insulation,
increasing to 24% for higher-rated houses (Table 6-3).

6.4 Floor insulation
The vast majority of houses within the study have a concrete slab for their ground floor. A small number
have raised floors (14 in Brisbane, 8 in Adelaide and 6 in Melbourne). Of these, 18 have no insulation, four
have some form of insulation, and six are unknown.
Of the houses that use concrete slabs, many use a waffle slab, which has insulative properties via the use of
polystyrene pods. The AccuRate software used for the star-rating modelling cannot formally model the
thermal impact of waffle pods, but a common work-around adopted by assessors is to include a layer of
expanded polystyrene on the underside of the slab. This polystyrene layer usually provides an R value of 1.0
to the slab. Table 6-4 lists the percentage use of waffle pods and the corresponding insulative impact. The
use of waffle pods over traditional, in-ground concrete slabs has been increasing over the years, and this is
reflected in the newer 5-star houses. The main reason for the increasing uptake is that waffle pod systems
are usually easier, faster and cheaper to install than traditional concrete slabs. The increased insulation

benefits have not been a driver of the uptake, but can provide up to a half-star increase in the rating in
some cities.

6.5 Double-glazed windows
In the heating-dominated cities, particularly Melbourne, double glazing helps to reduce heat loss over the
winter heating periods. However, double glazing is still a relatively expensive option, and consequently,
uptake has been limited. Nevertheless, Table 6-5 shows an increase in the use of double glazing in
Melbourne for the higher rated compared to the lower rated cohorts. A total of 13.3% of all windows in the
higher-rated houses were double-glazed, up from 7.7% in the lower-rated houses.

6.6 Glazing area
Windows typically account for the greatest amount of heat gain or loss in the building fabric. For example,
heat gain through an unshaded window can be 100 times greater than through the same area of insulated
wall (Reardon, Milne, McGee, & Downton, 2008). Consequently, reducing glazing area is often used as an
effective technique to improve the star rating of houses. Table 6-6 shows the reduction in glazing that has
occurred with the increase in star rating. The window/wall ratio indicates the percentage of external facade
that is glazed. There has been a small reduction in this ratio of around 1.1% in all cities. However, the
average area of glazing has also significantly reduced, with around a 20% reduction in all cities. The reason
why this has not translated to a bigger reduction in the window/wall ratio is that the houses themselves
have become smaller in area, and are more rectangular. Consequently, the average external wall area has
also reduced.

6.7 Window orientation
Maximising north-facing glazing and minimising west-facing glazing helps control heat gain through
windows. North-facing windows allow winter sun to enter to warm the house, while hot summer sun can
be excluded with effective shading. This is one of the main principles of passive design, and helps houses
reduce their reliance on auxiliary heating and cooling systems. Traditionally, the orientation of houses has
been dictated by the orientation of the block of land and the location of the street. Only limited attention
has been paid to the orientation of the windows, especially the large living area windows. Correctly
orientated windows will help improve a house’s star rating.
Small changes in window orientation can be observed between the star-rating cohorts (Table 6-7). In
Brisbane and Adelaide, the percentage of north-facing glazing has increased, while west-facing glazing has
decreased. In Melbourne, the percentage of north-facing glazing actually decreased, with the higher-rated
houses showing an increase in west-facing glazing.
North-facing glazing was considered to be any window that was within 30° either side of north, while
south-facing glazing was within 30° either side of south. East and west-facing glazing were the remaining
azimuths between north and south.

6.8 House area
A surprising finding has been that the average conditioned area of houses has reduced for the higher-rated
houses. This has occurred in all three cities, although only a small reduction was seen in Adelaide
(Table 6-8). The conditioned area of the house was taken from the AccuRate modelling and typically
excludes areas such as bathrooms, laundries and garages. The decrease in house size may be due to factors
such as a reduction in average block size or the cost of construction.

6.9 External wall area
With houses becoming smaller, the area of external walls would also be expected to reduce, and this is
reflected in the houses in the study. Table 6-9 shows that the change in external wall areas has been quite
significant, especially in Brisbane and Melbourne. It is important to note that the percentage change in wall
area is greater than the percentage change in floor area.
Table 6-10 lists the change in wall area after floor areas are corrected; still, around a 14% reduction in
external wall area is evident in all cities.
The reason for the change may be due to simpler floor layouts and more rectangular buildings. Reducing
the number of corners in a design will reduce the external wall perimeter and consequently reduce wall
area. Smaller blocks may also be a factor in driving the change to smaller, more rectangular buildings.

7 Construction costs in meeting compliance
As energy efficiency standards increase, the common belief has been that building costs will also increase.
As discussed in Section 6, the main techniques that have been observed to affect the star rating of houses
have been increased insulation levels, a shift to waffle pod slabs, an increase in the use of double glazing,
and a shift in window orientation. In addition, a possible shift towards more rectangular buildings has
reduced window area without significantly reducing window/wall area ratio. While many of these
techniques do incur costs, some actually reduce costs. In particular, the reduction in glazing area translates
to a direct cost saving as expensive glazing is replaced by less expensive walling. The reduction in wall area
also reduces cost.
An observed reduction in conditioned area for the higher-rated houses may have lead to a skewed cost
comparison, because the total cost for a smaller house will often be less than a comparable larger house.
To account for this, we excluded lower-rated houses with a conditioned space of greater than 230 m2. This
resulted in the average conditioned area of all houses being within approximately ±5% in each city.
The cost analysis involved extracting a list of materials and components, and their corresponding
quantities, from the AccuRate file for each house. Essentially, this resulted in a bill of quantities for those
elements of the house that affect star rating. For each star-rating cohort in each city, the quantities of the
various elements were summed and then divided by the number of houses in the cohort to derive an
average quantity of each element for a ‘typical’ house. The resulting quantities for each element were then
costed using cost data obtained from Rawlinsons Cost Guide 2011 (Rawlinsons, 2011). Appendix F lists the
unit costs that were applied.
As an example of this methodology, we can examine the use of double-glazed windows in Melbourne,
where 40 houses were below 5 stars and 91 houses were above 5 stars. Examination of the AccuRate data
revealed that the lower-rated cohort contained 1686 m2 of single glazing and 35 m2 of double glazing, while
the higher-rated cohort had 2873 m2 of single glazing and 443 m2 of double glazing. When divided by the
number of houses in each star-rating cohort, the lower-rated houses have an average total window area of
43 m2, of which double glazing represents only 0.87m2 (2%), and the higher-rated houses have an average
total window area of 36 m2, of which double glazing represents 4.86 m2 (13%). Consequently, it can be
concluded that in the higher-rated houses, on average, total window area has decreased while the
proportion of those windows that are double-glazed has increased. Costs can then be applied to these
average quantities. Using a cost of $461/m2 for a double-glazed awning window in Melbourne results in an
average cost of $400 for a lower-rated house (461 x 0.87), and $2242 for a higher-rated house (461 x 4.86).
Finally, the following assumptions were made to allow cost comparisons.
·
·
·
·
·

Expanded polystyrene in floors was considered to be waffle pods.
The cost of waffle pod concrete slab and standard in-ground concrete slab was considered the
same, so no cost difference was calculated.
All windows (both single and double-glazed) were considered to be awning windows with
aluminium frames.
All external walls were considered to be brick veneer with timber stud and painted plasterboard.
All wall and ceiling insulation was considered to be glasswool batts of the specified R value.

Table 7-1 lists the average cost per house for each of the star rating cohorts within each city. The surprising
result is that the costs related to achieving the regulations for the higher-rated houses are lower than the
costs incurred for the lower-rated houses. Closer examination of the data reveals that the main reason for
the cost saving is reduced external wall area and glazing area, which is occurring in all cities. The reduced
glazing translates to a significant cost saving as windows are replaced by walls. A standard brick veneer wall

is more than 40% cheaper than a standard single-glazed awning window, and more than 60% cheaper than
a double-glazed awning window.

The apparent simplification of design layout has lead to the observed reduction in external wall area, which
is the main reason for the cost savings. As discussed in Section 6.9, even after correcting for floor area,
external wall area has decreased by around 14%. This translates to a cost savings of around 15% for the
external walls. Other factors have also contributed, including the reduction in glazing area. The cost savings
more than compensate for the increased cost of improved insulation. In most cases, the incremental cost of
increasing insulation performance is small. For example, the cost difference between R2.5 and R4.0 ceiling
insulation is only $3.40/m2.
Overall, the measures required to achieve the higher ratings are costing at least $5,000 less than the
equivalent lower-rated house. In Brisbane, the 5-star houses are costing $7,400 less to achieve their higher
star requirement than the corresponding lower-rated houses. This result demonstrates the benefits of a
performance-based regulation as opposed to a prescriptive-based regulation. The reasons for the observed
changes in design may be due to factors unrelated to the star rating requirements, such as smaller lot sizes
and customer preferences. However, the inclusion of these design changes has an impact on both star
rating and cost.

8 Whole-of-house total energy usage and
greenhouse gas emissions
8.1 Sample representativeness and energy usage variations
The sample selection methodology described in 1.3.1 was chosen with the desire to measure
representative energy consumption for houses before and after changes to the BCA energy efficiency
regulations. The extent to which this has been achieved is crucial in understanding the confidence that
can be placed in the following energy efficiency data and analyses. Key questions that need to be asked
include:
·

Are the occupants in the lower and higher star-rating house cohorts sufficiently similar to allow us
to expect that energy usage patterns would be the same? Preliminary results in Section 3 suggest a
slight difference in occupancy for lower-rated houses than for higher-rated houses. However, the
results from assessments during peak usage periods of the day are consistent with the results
reported for seasonal periods. This suggests that occupancy differences are not unduly influencing
the seasonal results. However, further research is needed on the effects of star-dependent
occupancy to determine if they affect the star-rating dependence of energy consumption.

·

Are the houses in the lower and higher star-rating cohorts using the same heating and cooling
appliances? Reverse-cycle air conditioners were the dominant appliance in Brisbane and Adelaide.
In Melbourne, a larger fraction of the higher-rated houses had no cooling. Both Melbourne cohorts
used gas for winter heating, with only a small amount of reverse-cycle air conditioning. A small
number (~4%) of the lower-rated houses used electric-resistance heating, which was not evident in
the higher-rated houses.

·

Are the houses in the lower and higher star-rating cohorts the same size? Section 6.8 found that the
house sizes are generally fairly similar, with the exception of a number of very large (>300 m2)
houses, which are all in the lower star-rating cohort. Inclusion of these larger houses may skew the
lower star-rating cohort towards higher energy consumption.

·

Is the energy usage behaviour of the occupants in the two cohorts representative of normal
behaviour in the broader population? Section 3 found that around 15% of households are retiree
households (either single or couples) and 21% are working couples with no children. However, this
study is limited in scope, and as previously described, is not representative of all households in
Australia.

These measureable differences may provide some pointers towards possible differences. However, even in
an otherwise perfect sample (with no outwardly measureable distinguishing features), the selected houses
may still contain a biased group of individual occupants with electricity-using preferences that are not
representative of the broader population.
The spread of household energy use by frequency (Figure 8-1) shows that energy consumption exceeds the
median by factors of 3% for Brisbane, 15% for Adelaide and 11% for Melbourne. This suggests that energy
use, behaviour, house size and household income may be significant factors, and that simple averaging is
inappropriate for comparing star ratings.

To further check if the sample looks broadly representative, the average whole-of-house electricity
consumption in the sample houses in each city was compared against the expected electricity consumption
for houses in that city (Table 8-1). The expected annual electricity consumption was obtained using the
Energy Made Easy website calculator (http://www.energymadeeasy.gov.au/bill-benchmark), using a
comparable occupancy profile to the sample.

A major bias in the results reported in this section is that the CSIRO data set is extrapolated to one year,
from a sample that was taken over nine months. In the near future, we will have a year’s worth of data to
make these estimates more accurate. However, 8.1 suggests that (i) annual electricity use in the Adelaide
and Melbourne samples is broadly in line with the expected values, and that (ii) annual electricity usage in
the Brisbane sample is above the expected values. However, as expected, there is large variability in energy
usage between houses, and the ratios of standard deviations to mean values given in Table 8-1 are very
close to such ratios measured in much larger studies (statistics for a New South Wales study of house total
energy consumption: A. Higgins, CSIRO, personal communication). Average household gas energy
consumption in single dwellings in Melbourne is around 55,000 MJ/yr, whereas the sample of Melbourne
houses consumed about 37,600 MJ/yr each. This reduction possibly reflects the earlier introduction of
house efficiency regulations, and is consistent with an SPAusnet study of gas usage (Figure 1-1) (Centre for
International Economics, 2012).

Figure 8-3

Melbourne average household gas use by year of connection

These issues go some way towards explaining the very large spread of values that may be encountered in a
statistical analysis of energy consumption by householders. It is therefore important not to expect that
comparisons of simple averages from restricted populations can yield definitive results. For statistically
significant conclusions, it is necessary to use parameters that are, as far as possible, independent of human
behaviour. We have found that it is also necessary, particularly with heating and cooling energy
consumption, to consider the skewed statistical distribution. The values given in this section are provided in
response to the requirement for qualitative and indicative information. For statistically significant results,
we advise the reader to use sections 10 and 12, and understand that this only represents a subset of the
population of houses and householders.

8.2 Energy consumption
Electricity and natural gas are the two main fuel sources used to provide energy in the volunteer
households. For half the houses in the study, electricity consumption was monitored at a circuit level. For
the remainder of the houses, billing data was used (where available). For natural gas consumption, only
billing data was used. Monitored data was collected from June 2012 through to the end of February 2013.
To allow for a full-year comparison, data for the autumn period (March to May) was considered to be the
same as the spring period.
Electricity was used by all houses with air conditioners for summer cooling and in Brisbane and Adelaide for
winter heating, while natural gas was predominantly used for winter heating in Melbourne. A small number
of houses in Adelaide also used natural gas, but for the purpose of this analysis, natural gas consumption
was restricted to Melbourne only, and consumption averages were derived from the billing data received
from volunteer houses in this city. Electricity consumption averages were derived from the monitored
houses in each of the three cities.
Whole-of-house energy consumption varied over the year, due to the effect of seasonal changes on space
conditioning, hot water and lighting. This was especially true in heating-dominated climates such as
Melbourne, which rely on heating for much of the winter period. It should be noted, however, that space
conditioning (the component influenced by the NatHERS star rating) was generally less than a third of the
whole-of-house energy consumption. In the case of electricity particularly, other loads will significantly
affect whole-of-house energy consumption. Gas, which is only used for space heating, hot water, and to a
lesser extent, cooking, could be more significantly influenced by star rating.
Figure 8-4 shows the average seasonal energy consumption for houses in each city. In Brisbane and
Adelaide, the total energy consumption of the lower and higher star-rating cohorts was similar. However, in
Melbourne, a significant 35% reduction in energy consumption was seen in the higher-rated houses. This
was due entirely to a 54% reduction in gas consumption.
Only small differences in electricity consumption were seen between the star-rating cohorts in Brisbane
and Adelaide. Annual electricity consumption in the higher-rated houses in Melbourne was significantly
higher than in the lower-rated houses. Electricity consumption in the shoulder seasons (autumn and spring)
is more than 8% higher in the high star-rating Melbourne cohort, even though space conditioning would
not be expected to be in heavy use over these milder seasons.
Initial investigation of gas consumption in Melbourne found differences depending on the type of hot water
system installed. These results are discussed further in Appendix E and show that some of these results
were counterintuitive. Consequently, houses with gas-boosted solar hot water systems were removed from
the gas calculations done in this section, so that a clear comparison could be made for non-house heatingrelated gas consumption. Therefore, the dramatic reduction in gas consumption in Melbourne can be
wholly attributed to the reduced gas required for house heating.
For both Brisbane and Melbourne, the higher star-rating cohort showed around 16% higher electricity
consumption over summer than for the lower star-rating cohort.

Seasonal energy consumption by star rating and city

Standard energy tariff rates have been used to calculate the energy costs for households. Table 8-2 lists the

Average energy cost over the year was based on the daily average for each season. Table 8-3 shows that
overall, reductions in total energy costs were observed in Adelaide and Melbourne for the higher-rated
houses, with a 3% reduction in costs in Adelaide and a 13% reduction in Melbourne. Brisbane houses
effectively remained the same.

8.3 Greenhouse gas emissions
The calculations for the greenhouse gas emissions impact of household energy were based on the factors
given in the ‘National Greenhouse Accounts Factors – July 2012’ (Department of Climate Change and
Energy Efficiency, 2012).
Emission totals from electricity consumption are very much linked to the fuel source for the electricity. In
Melbourne, the majority of electricity comes from brown-coal generators. Consequently, Melbourne
emissions are higher than the other cities. Table 8-4 lists the greenhouse gas coefficients that have been
used in this study.

As discussed earlier in this section, energy savings were seen in the overall energy use data between the
star-rating cohorts in Adelaide and Melbourne. However, this does not necessarily translate to an equal
greenhouse gas emission reduction. In Brisbane and Adelaide, emission totals were in line with their energy
consumption, because only one energy source was used. However, this is not the case in Melbourne, where
a mix of energy sources is in use. Although a significant energy reduction was seen in Melbourne, which
was achieved through a significant reduction in gas consumption, it was countered somewhat by an
increase in electricity consumption. The much higher emissions coefficient for electricity in Melbourne has
consequently resulted in increased emissions from electricity consumption, countering the emission savings
from the reduced gas consumption. This has resulted in only an 8% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions
in Melbourne for the higher-rated houses, compared with their 46% decrease in energy consumption.

8.4 Reduced star-rating cohort
Following feedback from industry sources, we decided that it would be worthwhile to redo the calculations
in this section, focusing on a narrower star-rating band. This was to see if a bias was present, particularly in
the higher-rated cohort, which might lead to a skewing of results. The star-rating bands were restricted to
include houses that were 3.5 to 4.5 star for one cohort and 5 to 5.5 stars for the other cohort.
Figure 8-6 shows that improvements in energy efficiency were more identifiable in this reduced set,
particularly in Brisbane. Over the year, houses in Brisbane in the high star-rating cohort were on average
using 12% less energy than the lower star-rating cohort. Most of this improvement was realised through
autumn and spring energy savings of 25%. Summer still saw an increase in energy consumption among the
higher-rated houses (3%), but it was not as big a difference as seen in the earlier comparisons.
Once again, only small improvements were seen in the Adelaide houses, with a 3% reduction in the total
energy consumption for the higher-rated houses. This was entirely due to a reduced winter energy
consumption of 20%, which was offset by increases in the other seasons.
Finally, Melbourne houses again showed the biggest improvement, with a reduction in overall energy of
36% for the higher-rated houses, once again all due to a significant reduction in gas consumption of 57%.
As before, increases in electricity consumption were seen in all seasons for the higher-rated houses.

9 Heating/cooling energy
Section 8 provided analysis of whole-of-house energy consumption across all 414 houses of the study. This
section looks specifically at the fixed heating and cooling appliance monitoring data from the 209 fully submetered houses.
Figure 9-1 compares the average fixed heating and cooling appliance energy consumption and the average
whole-of-house energy consumption across 59 air-conditioned houses in Adelaide.

Figure 9-1

Average whole-of-house and heating and cooling energy consumption – Adelaide

Figure 9-1 shows that air-conditioning energy consumption is a major, but not totally dominant, energy
consumer across most of the year. However, it is highly volatile, and is far and away the dominant cause of
peak electricity demand.
It should be noted, however, that the simplicity of the comparison in Figure 9-1 created by the averaging
process masks a high degree of variability between houses. Variability is created by differences in factors
such as user occupancy (timing and number of people), internal heat loads, user comfort perceptions and
health needs. As a result, a full statistical analysis is required to properly interpret the data (see Section 10),
and the gross averaged data presented in this section should be treated with some caution.

9.1 Heating vs. cooling demand
Over the year, demand for heating or cooling energy will shift. In the more temperate climates, demand is
more focused on the summer cooling periods, whereas in the colder climates, winter heating energy is the
more dominant.
The average daily usage for houses in Brisbane is shown in Figure 9-2, which shows that winter energy
consumption is quite low compared with summer usage. This reflects the sub-tropical climate of Brisbane,
which has a mean maximum temperature of 21.8 °C in July. Consequently, winter heating requirements are
minimal. However, the January mean maximum for Brisbane is 30.2 °C, which falls well outside the
accepted temperature comfort band, so it would be expected that cooling energy is required.

Daily heating and cooling electricity use in Brisbane

Adelaide’s climate is much more variable than Brisbane’s, with relatively cool winters and hot dry summers.
Mean maximum temperatures for Adelaide in July and January are 15.3 and 29.3 °C, respectively. Figure 9-3
shows the average daily usage in Adelaide. The periods of most use in winter were from 5:00 am to 9:00 am
and 5:00 pm to 10:00 pm local time. We estimated that the corresponding ‘in use’ peak power load for the
evening period between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm was 1.8 kW Peak power loads, Section 12.2). This suggests
that during this period, a significant proportion of air conditioners would have been working at their rated
power independently of the NatHERS house rating. Their measurement would therefore contribute noise,
but not much signal, to the estimate of the energy impact of the star rating.

Melbourne’s climate is heating dominated and experiences cold winters, while summers are generally
milder, although hot periods are not uncommon. On average, Melbourne has mean maximum
temperatures in July and January of 13.1 and 26.3 °C, respectively.
Figure 9-4 shows the average daily heating and cooling electricity use in Melbourne. Although winter
demand is higher than summer, the summer demand is still significant. Like Adelaide, winter has a morning
and afternoon peak, while summer demand is restricted to the afternoon. The winter profile for Melbourne
is based on only a few households that rely on electricity for their winter heating, so some caution is
required in interpreting these results. The majority of Melbourne houses use gas for their winter heating.

Daily heating and cooling electricity use in Melbourne

9.2 Winter performance
Heating-related energy consumption varies over the year due to seasonal changes. This is especially true in
the heating-dominated climates, such as Melbourne, which rely on heating for much of the winter period.
Table 9-1 shows the average daily heating energy consumption for houses in each climate zone, along with
the associated energy costs and greenhouse emissions. A small reduction in energy consumption is seen
between the star-rating cohorts in Brisbane and Adelaide, but a significant reduction is seen in Melbourne.
Brisbane and Adelaide rely on reverse-cycle systems for winter heating, while Melbourne uses natural gas.
Overall, winter energy consumption in Melbourne is significantly more than in the other cities, and this
translates to increased daily costs and greenhouse emissions. Daily winter costs in Melbourne are around
$3.50, while in Brisbane, they are a quarter of that cost. The higher electricity tariff in Adelaide puts daily
winter costs at around $2.20. Costs are based on the tariffs listed in Table 8-2.
Daily winter greenhouse gas emissions peak in Melbourne at 13 kg for lower-rated houses, but drop by an
impressive 50% for the higher-rated houses.

9.3 Summer performance
Daily summer energy consumption is higher than daily winter consumption in Brisbane and is similar in
Adelaide, but is significantly lower in Melbourne. Electricity consumption between the star-rating cohorts
actually increases in all three cities for the higher-rated houses, with a 28% increase in Brisbane (Table 9-2).
This translates to increased energy costs and resulting greenhouse gas emissions.

9.4 Annual performance
Average heating and cooling energy consumption over the year was based on the daily average obtained
over the monitoring period. Table 9-3 shows that overall, significant reductions in heating and cooling
energy consumption were observed in higher-rated houses in Melbourne (48% reduction), while the energy
consumption in higher-rated houses in Adelaide virtually remained unchanged. However, higher rated
houses in Brisbane actually had a 12% increase in energy consumption compared with the lower-rated
houses.
Although large reductions in overall energy consumption were observed in Melbourne, this did not
translate to a corresponding reduction in their greenhouse gas emissions. Overall gas consumption
decreased by 52%, but this decrease was counteracted by an 8% increase in electricity consumption. The

higher greenhouse coefficients that apply to electricity reduce the savings achieved through the gas
reductions. Consequently, emissions have reduced by 32%, which is still a significant saving.

10 Statistical analysis of the relationship between
heating and cooling energy and star rating
10.1 Statistical approach
Sections 8 and 9 compared the average energy consumption of entire cohorts of houses that were broadly
categorised as before (<5 star) and after (>5 star) changes in the building energy efficiency regulations, in
Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane. The results indicated that the higher-rated houses used less energy in
winter, but more energy in summer, compared with the lower-rated houses. However, the large variability
in energy consumption observed inside each cohort means that these results cannot be claimed to be
statistically significant.
Further statistical analysis was required to better interpret the results. This was done by disbanding the
segregation between the cohorts based on the star rating being above or below 5. Instead, the analysis
looked for direct statistical correlations of the effect of house star rating (i.e. the re-rated star ratings, see
1.3.2) on energy consumption using single and multi-variable linear regression.
The regressions were performed on datasets of comparable houses and scenarios. The groupings were by
city, by season and by air-conditioning technology type, as illustrated by the red boxes in Figure 10-1.

Figure 10-1

Subgroups for assessment including sample numbers and appliance types

We chose the linear regression approach because it was likely to provide the most accurate results, given
the statistical distributions of the data. This is described in more detail in Appendix A – Methodology.
The house star ratings followed Gaussian (bell-shaped) distributions (e.g. Figure 10-2). Ideally, we would
have selected houses so that all star ratings were evenly represented. However, we did not know the star
ratings of the houses before they were recruited, and therefore had to recruit houses by year of
construction as a proxy for star rating for recruitment only. The analysis itself used directly and consistently
reassessed star-rating values.

Distribution of star ratings in a Melbourne sample

The measured energy values had skewed (exponential) distributions (e.g. Figure 10-3). These distributions
appeared to be a fundamental characteristic of the sample population, with the number of energy users
increasing as their energy use reduced. This was unrelated to the type of heating or cooling appliance or to
the shift to a higher star-rating range described below. This distribution may suggest a possible correlation
with household income. Unfortunately, data was not available to explore this variable.

Distribution of daily heating energy for houses in Brisbane in winter

The regression analysis approach allowed us to fit a linear model to the data across a broad range of star
values. We then applied the regression coefficients to calculate the difference in energy consumption
within the NatHERS rating band from 3.5–4 stars to 5 stars to compare with the results of Section 9.

Regression analysis
A wide range of single and multi-variable linear regressions were performed to check for possible
correlations between the seasonally averaged consumption of energy in the fixed space conditioning
appliances, expressed as kilowatt hours per day per square metre of conditioned floor area, with possible
explanatory variables. These possible explanatory variables included:
· house star rating
· the average seasonal outdoor temperature taken from the nearest Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)
weather station
· the average seasonal indoor temperature measured in the main living area of each house (whether
or not the air conditioner was operating)
· the difference between the average seasonal indoor and outdoor temperatures (as above)
· the average seasonal outdoor dewpoint taken from the nearest BoM weather station
· quality of building construction
· householder self-reported energy efficiency behaviour
A regression analysis (Equation 1) showed a significant linear dependence of energy consumption on star
rating and temperature:

E = ka.Star + kb.ΔT + kc

....(1)

Where

E

is the seasonal average daily house heating or cooling energy per unit floor area of the
house air-conditioned space (kWh d-1 m-2)

Star is the re-rated star value of the house
ΔT

is the temperature difference between the main living area and the nearest BoM
weather station (°C)

The coefficients obtained from the regression were:

ka (kWh d-1 m-2 star-1)
kb (kWh d-1 m-2 °C-1)
kc (kWh d-1 m-2).
Other variables did not have a recognisable influence on energy consumption.
Interestingly, an even more statistically significant correlation was typically seen between house star rating
and the difference between the average seasonal indoor and outdoor temperatures. This can be seen in a
linear regression of temperature against star rating (Equation 2):

ΔT = kd.Star + ke

....(2)

The coefficients obtained from the regression were:

kd (°C star-1)
ke (°C).
This second regression analysis suggests that as star rating changes, there is a noticeable change in house
internal temperature. For example, in winter, higher-rated houses were measurably warmer. In physical
terms, this has been interpreted to mean that there were three types of energy savings:

·

observed savings, i.e., the energy actually saved
inferred savings, i.e., energy being consumed that could have been saved if the temperature in the
higher-rated houses was kept the same as in the lower-rated houses. If an inferred energy saving is
available, it takes a positive sign in the modelling, because the inferred saving is actually a
consumption and only potentially a saving
total savings, consisting of the observed saving and the inferred saving.

The total energy saving dependence on star rating is represented by ka from Equation 1. This is because the
regression evaluates ka at a constant temperature for all star ratings.
The inferred energy saving dependence on star rating is represented by (kb.kd), where kb gives the
dependence of energy consumption on temperature and kd gives the dependence of temperature on star
rating.
The observed energy saving dependence on star rating can be obtained by adding the inferred energy
saving to the total energy saving, and is represented by (ka+kb.kd): noting that for a saving, ka takes a
negative value, and that for an inferred saving, kb and kd take positive values. This is because temperature
differences (kb) were usually positive in winter, and energy consumption per degree Celsius (kd) is also
expressed as a positive value. Where there is an inferred energy saving, it is only a potential saving, and
therefore appears as a positive value indicating an actual consumption.
A p-value limit of 0.05 was set, above which the likelihood that there was an energy saving was rejected as
being statistically uncertain. A related parameter, the confidence interval, was set at 95% for each constant.
This described the range of values likely for any house in 95% of the sample population. A low p-value
indicated whether the model estimate of the average energy saved was reasonable; it did not indicate the
level of energy saving expected for any particular house. Likewise, a broad confidence interval did not by
itself invalidate the estimates of average values for energy saved.
Values obtained for these constants, together with their corresponding energy reduction estimates, are
given in Table 10-1 to Table 10-7. Each constant was associated with a p-value (giving an indication of
whether the linear correlation is not a correct hypothesis; the lower, the more certain). The model
coefficient values are expressed in the figures and tables as the best fit values with 95% confidence
intervals. The energy reduction estimates are given as modulus (signless) values.

10.2 Results
10.2.1 IMPACT ON HOUSE HEATING ENERGY IN BRISBANE
Figure 10-4 shows the multivariable linear regression of heating energy against NatHERS star rating. With a
p-value of 0.14 and a very low value for ka, it was concluded that there was no significant dependence of
energy consumption on star rating. This may be because the low levels of energy consumption make it
harder to measure such a trend. However, (i) the dependence of energy consumption on temperature
difference (Figure 10-5) and (ii) the dependence of temperature difference on star rating (Figure 10-6) were
both statistically significant, indicating that on average, temperatures increased by 0.6 °C for houses with
higher star ratings.

10.2.2 IMPACT ON HOUSE HEATING ENERGY IN ADELAIDE
Adelaide houses were generally equipped with either gas or reverse-cycle heat pumps for house heating.
There were too few gas-heated houses to make statistically significant conclusions. However, there were
sufficient houses with heat pump air conditioners for their electricity consumption to be assessed.
Figure 10-7 gives the dependence of heating energy on NatHERS star rating. There was a substantial
reduction in the average energy consumption as the NatHERS star rating increases. The spread of values
among individual houses is large, ranging over ±75% of the mean. However, the p values are sufficiently low
to give confidence in the mean value for energy saving.
Figure 10-9 appears to show a temperature dependence on NatHERS star rating, although the effect is not
statistically robust (p=0.14). The slope is positive, with a value of 0.66oC Star-1, indicating that on average,
the main living area may be warmer by 0.8 °C in houses with higher NatHERS star ratings. The spread of
temperature values among individual houses is large, ranging over ±140% of the mean.

10.2.3 IMPACT OF THE STAR RATING ON HOUSE HEATING ENERGY IN MELBOURNE
Gas heaters were the principal appliances used for house heating in Melbourne. We did not directly
measure gas consumption in this study, but relied on the winter and summer gas bills. Our measure of gas
heating for each house was to subtract the average summer-time value from the winter-time values, to
account for appliances that were not used for house heating. These typically included cooking appliances
and hot water systems.
The impact of solar hot water on gas consumption in houses with higher NatHERS star ratings
In estimating house heating energy, we at first assumed that solar hot water gas savings were not
correlated with the NatHERS star rating. However, it was found that both the relative proportion of houses
and the capacity of solar hot water systems varied considerably with the date of installation over the period
for which star ratings were being assessed. The net effect was that houses with higher NatHERS star ratings
tended to use more gas to boost their water heaters in winter than houses with lower star ratings. This is
described further in Appendix E . After removing houses with gas-boosted solar hot water systems from the
data set, the regressions showed that the houses with higher NatHERS star ratings, on average, used less
heating energy in winter, and also had higher temperatures in their main living areas.
The regression analysis
Figure 10-10 shows the dependence of heating energy on star rating when houses with solar hot water
have been removed from the sample. The regression slope has a value of -0.25 kWh d-1 m-2. This indicated
average savings of 25 kWh m-2 for the higher star rating cohort over the winter season.
Figure 10-12 shows the dependence of temperature difference on star rating in Melbourne. The slope for
the dependence of temperature difference on the NatHERS star rating is positive, with a value of
0.54oC/Star, indicating that on average the main living area is 0.7 °C warmer in houses with higher NatHERS
star ratings. This temperature dependence on star rating, together with the value for kb from Figure 10-11,
suggests an inferred energy saving of 3 kWh m-2.

Table 10-3 summarises the energy savings for the sample of houses with higher star ratings compared with
houses with lower star ratings during the Melbourne winter season. The reduction in energy consumption
in higher-rated houses was substantial, with a comparatively small amount contributing to raising the
house temperature. The actual energy saving was 25 kWh m-2. Another 3.2 kWh m-2 was available due to
the increased temperature.

The summer cooling energy consumption of houses in Brisbane is illustrated in Figure 10-13, which shows
that cooling electricity consumption increased with increasing star rating. There was no apparent
dependence of temperature difference on star rating. However, this may have been hidden, because the
temperature difference cycled between positive and negative values throughout the season. Table 10-4
gives values for the increase in seasonal energy consumption.

In Melbourne, the cooling energy consumption increased when heat pumps were used in houses with
higher star ratings (Figure 10-15). There was no apparent dependence of temperature on star rating,
possibly due to the temperature difference cycling between positive and negative values throughout the
season.
Table 10-6 gives the associated increase in consumption.

Regressions were also performed to determine the impact of star rating on the cooling energy consumption
when evaporative coolers were used (Figure 10-16). The evaporative cooler sample may be problematic,
because energy consumption is significantly influenced by rated air flow, rather than achieving set point air
temperatures based on house energy efficiency. It is also possible that some houses may have had other
appliances on the electrical circuit of the evaporative cooler.
The cooling energy consumption appears to increase with increasing star rating. Again, there was no
apparent dependence of star rating on temperature, possibly due to cycling between positive and negative
values throughout the season. Table 10-7 gives the associated increase in consumption. In this instance, the
percentage increase is very high. Nevertheless, the absolute value of the cooling energy consumption is
about half that of the cohort of houses with heat pumps in Melbourne.

10.2.7 WINTER HEATING
In all three cities, the higher-rated houses had a warmer indoor temperature over winter. There are a
number of possible explanations for this temperature increase.
·
·

·

Householders may have set their thermostats higher in the higher-rated houses.
The increased temperature could be due to the several degrees Celsius of ‘dead band’ in the
temperature controller. Such dead bands are designed into air conditioner temperature controllers
to improve their stability. Comparing, for example, two groups of houses, the higher-rated house
would tend to have lower thermal leakage and perhaps greater thermal mass. As a result, the
cycling time of air conditioners would be increased in the higher-rated houses, giving them time to
reach a higher average temperature within the temperature controller’s dead-band.
End user behaviour may have been to ignore set points and instead, for example, turn the
appliance on maximum when they feel cold and then switch it off when they go to bed. In this way,
the higher-rated houses (which have reduced heat leakage) would arrive at a higher equilibrium
internal house temperature where the maximum capacity of the appliance matches the heat
leakage from the house.

10.2.8 SUMMER COOLING
The impact of the NatHERS rating system on house cooling energy consumption was difficult to assess in all
three climate zones. Interestingly, the average seasonal temperature of the houses in summer was not
significantly below the average outside ambient temperature. It appears that periods of house cooling
below ambient are being cancelled out (on average) by periods where the house is significantly above
ambient (e.g. when no one is home). It may be that the seasonal temperature difference vs. star rating
regression approach is less valid, because of the hour-by-hour oscillation between positive and negative
values, compared with the hour-by-hour winter temperature difference which is essentially always positive.
However, an analysis of peak usage resolved to half hourly intervals is given in section 12.4.2 that is
consistent with the above seasonal analysis. The unexpected trend appears to be that energy consumption
increases with star rating.
Possible explanations for this phenomenon are given below.
i.

If air conditioners were largely operating at full capacity, their energy consumption would no
longer reflect the thermal efficiency of the house. This could be due to end-user behaviour being to
ignore the use of set points, and put the air-conditioners on maximum cooling when used at all (a
corollary of the explanation of the winter house temperature rise effect discussed above).
Alternatively, it could be due to undersizing of air conditioners relative to the heat load at the time
of installation, or to the warmer-than-average weather conditions for the summer of 2012–13. In
any case, if air conditioners are predominantly running on maximum, then the measurements
would primarily be reporting the capacity of the cooling appliances, rather than the efficiency of
the house.
To test this theory, we compared the average nameplate maximum electricity consumption of the
installed air-conditioning appliances against the average demand of the house sample over a typical
summer day. This analysis measured peak power loads averaged across all houses in each city
(Section 12.2).

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

ii.

Data input assumptions to the NatHERS methodology may not adequately represent typical end
user behaviour and the typical quantities of internal heat loads from appliances. Of particular
importance is the assumption that people use air conditioner set points to maintain a relatively
steady temperature in the house over waking hours, and that they open windows to provide
additional ventilation when appropriate. If an air conditioner is turned off in summer and the house
is shut up (e.g. if people are away from home), then stored heat is likely to build up in the fabric of
the house. This may not be being adequately accounted for in the current data input assumptions.
It is interesting to look at average diurnal summer and winter temperature profiles for the sample
houses in each of the three cities (Error! Reference source not found.). In the small hours of the
morning (at night) on a summer day in Brisbane, the internal temperature of the houses is well
above the outside temperature. This is one example that would suggest that people are not taking
advantage of the opportunity for passive cooling through ventilation. Ventilation is a particularly
important concept that can be used to encourage occupants to save energy and achieve comfort,
as described in Figure 10-18.

iii.

Some differences in occupancy between lower and higher-rated houses were reported in sections
3.1 and 3.2. If significant, these might influence the dependence of energy consumption on star
rating. The potential impact of a difference in occupancy was tested by assessing energy
consumption during peak usage times of the day (Section 12.4.2). The results were consistent with
the seasonal energy consumption reported here, suggesting that the differences in occupancy were
insufficient to make a significant difference in energy consumption. Likewise, such influences would
not explain why heating energy was saved in winter in higher-rated houses, whereas it was not
possible to see such a saving in summer. Nevertheless, this should be studied further.

10.3 Summary of results
10.3.1 WINTER
In winter in all three cities, energy was saved in higher NatHERS star-rated houses compared with
lower-rated houses, where the temperature difference between the interior and exterior of the
houses was held constant. Higher NatHERS star-rated houses had significantly higher temperature
differences than lower-rated houses.
·

·

·

In Brisbane, there was no statistically significant decrease in heating energy consumption with
NatHERS star rating. However, the higher-rated houses were on average 0.6 °C warmer than the
lower-rated houses. This was equivalent to a heating energy to achieve this temperature
difference of 61 kWh over the winter season.
In Adelaide, heating energy consumption decreased by 155 kWh for the winter period for
higher-rated compared with lower-rated houses. Additionally there was some indication that the
higher star rated houses were 0.8 °C warmer than the lower-rated houses, though this was
within an 85% confidence interval and needs further measurement. This corresponds to an
inferred saving of 172 kWh over the winter season. The total saving (actual+inferred) was 39% of
the average heating energy used during this period by the lower-rated houses.
In Melbourne, heating energy consumption decreased by 4421 kWh for the winter period in
higher-rated compared with lower-rated houses. The higher-rated houses were warmer than the
lower-rated houses by 0.7 °C, so on this occasion it would have been possible to save 549 kWh
by reducing house temperatures to the average for lower-rated houses. The total saving
(actual+inferred) was 56% of the average heating energy used during this period by the lowerrated houses.

10.3.2 SUMMER
In summer in Brisbane and Melbourne, there appeared to be a significant increase in energy
consumption in higher-rated houses. However: i) relatively few houses in Brisbane had ratings
greater than 5 star; ii) in Melbourne the evaporative cooling data may have been affected by factors
other than house thermal efficiency, such as air flow rates; and iii) the unusually hot summer may
have meant that air conditioners were running at full capacity, so that their energy consumption
would not accurately reflect house thermal efficiency.
·

·
·

·

In Brisbane, cooling energy consumption increased by 1.3 kWh/m-2 for the summer period for
the higher-rated houses. This was 31% of the average cooling energy use by the lower-rated
houses.
In Adelaide, no statistically significant relationship was found between cooling energy use and
star rating.
In Melbourne, the cooling energy consumed by heat pump cooling increased by 1.4 kWh/m-2 for
the summer period. This was 38% of the average cooling energy use during the same period by
the lower-rated houses.
In Melbourne, the cooling energy consumed by evaporative cooling increased by 1.4 kWh/m-2
for the summer period. This was 80% of the average cooling energy use during the same period
by the lower-rated houses.

Part 3 Supporting data

11 Overview of data – heating/cooling
performance
11.1 City impact – heating/cooling energy
The annual impact of changes over the entire stock of new constructions within each city can be
assessed using dwelling units approvals data. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data for total new
house approvals in 2012 shows that Brisbane had 18,602 approvals, Adelaide had 6,611 approvals
and Melbourne had 28,032 new house approvals (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013). Although
the three cities do have multiple climate zones within them, the vast majority of the building
approvals are contained in the capital cities of each state, and these align with the climate zones
used in this study. The ABS data used does not include approvals of apartments or units; these
dwelling types have been excluded, because they were not included in this study.
Applying these annual approval numbers to the energy consumption data for the two star-rating
cohorts provides an indication of the impact of the star rating requirements for each city, as well as
the total impact for the combined study area.
Table 11-1 shows that the combined heating/cooling energy impact over the three cities of having all
new house construction built to a 5-star standard, rather than a below 5-star standard, is an annual
energy saving of 78 GWh. However, the energy savings have mainly been achieved through reduced
gas consumption in Melbourne (82 GWh), and the impact is reduced by a 4-GWh increase in
electricity consumption. This fuel source shift has an impact on the greenhouse gas emissions, due
to the high greenhouse gas emissions coefficients for electricity compared with gas. However, an
overall decrease in greenhouse gas emissions of 11 kilotonnes is still achieved.

11.2 City impact – total energy
Table 11-2 shows that the annual total whole-of-house energy saving impact over the three cities of
having all new house construction built to a 5-star standard, rather than a below-5 star standard, is
an annual energy saving of 195 GWh. This translates to a total annual energy cost saving of $11.6 M.
However, again the energy savings have mainly been achieved through reduced gas consumption in
Melbourne (204 GWh). A 9-GWh increase in electricity consumption reduces this impact.
Nevertheless, greenhouse gas emissions are decreased by 25 kilotonnes, which is the equivalent of
removing 5208 cars off the road each year. 3

11.3 Cost effectiveness of the standard, and the market
adjustment vs. predictions
As is customary before any regulatory changes are enacted, a RIS was prepared for the proposed
move to a 5-star energy efficiency requirement. RIS 2006-1, “Proposal to Amend the Building Code
of Australia to increase the Energy Efficiency Requirements for Houses” (Australian Building Codes
Board, 2006) was released in March 2006, ahead of the proposed changes to the BCA 2006 in May
2006. The RIS investigated the nationwide impacts from the introduction of the increased
requirements, with a particular focus on the financial, energy consumption and greenhouse emission
impacts.
The financial impacts looked at construction costs, avoidable energy costs, appliance costs and a
total lifetime cost. Energy consumption looked at savings in gas and electricity consumption, while
the overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was estimated. Two summary impact measures
were reported. The benefit/cost ratio for impacts on the lifetime cost of housing, with no dollar
value assigned to greenhouse savings, was calculated to be 1.27. The average net national cost of
expected reductions in greenhouse emissions was calculated as –3.6 cents/kg of CO2 equivalent.
The findings from this project provide some useful (but not conclusive) evidence relevant to the
assumptions and predictions used in the RIS. The RIS was based on an effective life of the regulation

of 10 years, from 2007 until 2016, by which time it was planned to be reviewed. Consequently, this
study is approximately half way through this period. It is important to note that since the release of
this RIS a further increase in energy efficiency requirement has occurred, from May 2011. RIS 2009-6
was undertaken to implement this increase (Centre for International Economics, 2009). However,
the assumptions and predictions used in this RIS have not been investigated in this report, because
only a small number of houses in the study have been subject to the increased standard.

11.3.1 FINANCIAL IMPACTS
The RIS estimated the construction costs for all eight climate zones as defined in the Building Code
of Australia. However, for the purpose of this study, only the three climate zones that we focused on
will be examined. The RIS also based costs on four different house designs and two different floor
systems for each design (concrete slab and suspended timber), to give a total of eight different
designs and construction costs. Table 11-3 lists the estimated additional costs from the RIS for the
four designs based on the use of a concrete slab floor as well as a ‘representative house’ that was
used as an average. The table also shows the costs as estimated through this study.
The RIS found that on average, there would be a cost increase in all cities, although for the passive
solar design there was a small cost saving in Adelaide and Melbourne. In contrast, this study found
that there was a reduction in costs in all cities.

11.3.2 BENEFIT/COST RATIO
The RIS calculated a benefit/cost ratio of 1.27. However, results from this study make it impossible
to calculate a comparison ratio, because no costs have actually been incurred. Indeed, costs
associated with meeting the standards have reduced, while appearing to still be delivering small
energy and greenhouse gas savings. A fuel shift appears to have also occurred with increased
electricity consumption, but this is countered by reduced natural gas consumption. This fuel shift
means that the greenhouse gas savings are not as significant as the energy savings, because a larger
greenhouse gas coefficient is applied to electricity (especially in Melbourne) than natural gas.
Overall, energy, energy costs and greenhouse savings have been achieved in all three cities, although
seasonal variations do occur, and the summer energy increases require further investigation. These
savings have been achieved for no additional construction costs; instead, indirect construction cost
savings may have been achieved. Furthermore, it is possible that consumers have elected to
translate the savings achieved by their home’s thermal performance to increase comfort levels by
keeping their houses warmer in winter.

12 Key factors affecting the statistical
assessment
12.1 Energy consumption
An essential precursor to assessing the impact of the NatHERS star rating on heating and cooling
energy was to understand how energy use varied with different locations and at different times of
the year. This section describes how levels of consumption changed between climate zones and over
the times of greatest use in winter and summer. It also describes changes in consumption depending
on when and where different types of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) appliances
were used most often.

12.1.1 CLIMATE ZONES AND HOURS OF HVAC USAGE
When heating and cooling appliances are operating at their maximum power and duty cycle, their
energy consumption cannot be used to accurately determine the amount of energy saved in houses
with higher star ratings. This is because when operating at full capacity, energy consumption does
not change with small differences in load. Because of this, we assessed the extent to which HVAC
equipment may have been operating at full capacity by measuring how often they were operating at
full power and with a high level of usage. The term ‘usage’ in this report describes the duration for
which a heating or cooling appliance was actively heating or cooling. It incorporates periods of
operation by householders, as well as the appliance thermostatically controlled duty cycle.
Figure 12-1 and Figure 12-2 show heating and cooling appliance usage as a cumulative percentage of
hours per season. A value of 100% corresponds to about 60 houses each in Brisbane, Adelaide and
Melbourne. In winter, the maximum possible usage corresponds to 2208 hours with the appliance
on 24 hours a day, seven days a week; in summer, it is 2160 hours. The percentage use may reflect
both household behaviour in switching the appliance on or off, and automatically controlled
switching of the appliance.
Conclusions from the usage across climate zones were consistent with expectations, in that:
·
·
·
·

Adelaide and Melbourne have considerably more usage hours than Brisbane for winter
heating, and Melbourne has more usage hours than Adelaide.
All three cities showed similar levels of cooling usage hours.
Brisbane used more hours for summer cooling than for winter heating.
Adelaide and Melbourne used more hours for winter heating than for summer cooling.

Peak periods were assumed to be approximately six hours per day. This amounts to a maximum of
552 hours in winter and 540 hours in summer. Figure 12-1 indicates that during the 2012 winter,
Adelaide and Melbourne may have had 40–50% of household heat pumps operating for longer than
the peak period. Likewise, in the summer of 2012–13, about 20% of household heat pumps in all
three cities may have been operating longer than the peak period. This suggests that a significant
number of heat pumps were working at full capacity during peak periods of winter. The duty cycle of
HVAC units is analysed in Section 12.2, where the management of peak power loads is considered
for much shorter time intervals.

12.1.2 HVAC USAGE HOURS AND STAR RATING
The level of heating and cooling energy use in an appliance may be controlled by switching the
appliance on an off, either manually, or using a thermostat. Measuring the hours of use or duty cycle
of an appliance can therefore be a useful, but indirect, measure of energy consumption. Figure 12-3
and Figure 12-4 compare hours of appliance operation between the star-rating cohorts. There was
only one case with a substantial difference, which was for winter heating in Melbourne, where heat
pumps in the higher-rated houses were used much less than in the lower-rated houses.

Star rating and HVAC per cent usage in summer (Figure 12-3)
·
·
·

In Brisbane, the lower-rated houses used slightly less hours of heat pump cooling. This may
have been due to the pumps for the higher-rated houses having lower power ratings.
In Adelaide, the hours of heat pump cooling were similar for both star-rating groups.
In Melbourne, the lower-rated houses used slightly less hours of heat pump cooling,
whereas for evaporative cooling, there was very little difference between the two groups.

Star rating and HVAC per cent usage in winter (Figure 12-4)
·

·

In Brisbane, there was no difference between the lower and higher-rated houses, despite
the tendency for higher-rated house to have heat pumps with lower power ratings than the
lower-rated houses ( 12.3.2).
In Adelaide, the higher-rated houses used slightly less hours of heat pump heating, whereas
the opposite was true for Melbourne. The result for Melbourne should be treated with
caution, because it had relatively low sample numbers for heat pumps due to the prevalence
of gas heating in these zones, and because some heat pumps may have been supplementary
to gas heating.

12.1.3 ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION
When individual houses were assessed over the nine-month period, the electricity consumption data
was quite scattered and could not be readily analysed. Much of the scatter in this data is due to
interfering variables, such as: internal and external temperatures, human behaviour, occupancy,
usage, and difference in electricity to thermal energy conversion factors associated with multiple
appliance types. Conversion factors can vary by a factor of three or four between heat pumps and
gas for heating, and between heat pumps and evaporative coolers. Appliance performance can also
be significantly affected by appliance age, level of maintenance and humidity, making it impossible
to accurately determine their operating efficiency.
These factors had a profound impact on the analysis for Adelaide and Melbourne. We had to
segregate groups of appliances by type for the analysis, with a corresponding reduction in sample
numbers. To reduce the influence of these sources of data noise from interfering variables, we have:
·

·
·

focused on measurements made during seasonal and daily periods of high consumption
o this was to increase the magnitude of any change in heating and cooling energy
consumption compared to the data noise from interfering variables
o to achieve this, we assessed data from the winter and summer seasons and three
periods of high thermal energy usage during the day, including 06:30–08:30, 15:00–
17:00 and 19:00–21:00
partitioned the data into homogenous blocks by climate zone, appliance type and star rating
identified key variables and compensated for their effect, where possible, using multiple
regression.

Seasonal HVAC Electricity Consumption
Figure 12-5 and Figure 12-6 compare the average household electricity consumption of different
appliance types in the three cities, in summer and winter, respectively. In particular, the results
show that evaporative coolers consumed less electricity than heat pumps, although this difference is
less significant in Melbourne. This may reflect the use of higher evaporative cooling air duct
velocities in Melbourne. Or, electricians may be putting additional devices on the evaporative cooler
electrical circuit in Melbourne, but not in Adelaide. The presence or absence of additional devices on
the evaporative cooler electrical circuits was not recorded in the switch board, but was assessed by
visual inspection of consumption patterns.

Daily average cooling appliance electricity consumption for each city

Average daily winter HVAC energy consumption was dominated by gas consumption in Melbourne
(Figure 12-6). This is in part because of its colder winters, with an average temperature of 10 °C in
2012, compared to the Adelaide average of 15 °C and the Brisbane average of 16 °C. Gas energy
consumption for heating in the Melbourne cohort is also very high compared to heat pump
electricity consumption, possibly because of the availability of cheap, high-capacity gas heating.
Another factor in the high gas energy consumption is that gas heater conversion of energy to useful
heat is 70–80%, with significant heat lost in the exhaust and in ventilation. Conversely, reverse-cycle
heat pumps run with a coefficient of performance (COP) of about 300%.

12.1.4 HOUSE TEMPERATURE AND TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES
Figure 12-7 and Figure 12-8 show the internal temperature in the main living area, and the
temperature difference between it and the nearest BoM weather station. In both winter and
summer, the air temperature inside the house was consistently higher than at the nearest BoM
weather station, though the temperature difference was considerably lower in summer than in
winter. This only accounts for the air temperature, and does not include the temperature rise due to
absorption of radiant heat. Occasionally, between 15:00 and 17:00, when the average air
conditioner energy consumption was highest in summertime, the internal temperature did fall
below the weather station temperature.

12.2 Peak power loads
The use of HVAC appliances was a key part of assessing the impact of NatHERS star rating on house
heating and cooling energy consumption. This section assesses HVAC appliances, how they might be
affected by the NatHERS star rating, and whether the occupants’ appliance usage patterns might
have unduly influenced the assessment of the NatHERS star-rating impact on heating and cooling
energy consumption.
We measured the HVAC energy, power and duty cycle for summer days during periods of high
occupancy to: i) check if higher star ratings were helping to reduce peak energy loads, and ii) see if
limits to appliance cooling or heating capacity, combined with high thermal loads, explained the
absence of a NatHERS star-rating impact on cooling energy consumption. Specifically, the
methodology required investigation over three time periods:
·
·
·

06:30–08:30 (early morning)
15:00–17:00 (mid-afternoon)
19:00–21:00 (evening).

During these periods, measurements of HVAC energy consumption were taken only when the
equipment was running, i.e., in use. In this report, the term ‘in use’ applies to the amount of energy
consumed while a heating or cooling appliance was switched on, through either manual or
automatic control. It does not include appliances that were not being used or that were running on
standby. The in-use energy was estimated for each house as the energy used in each two-hour time
period. The in-use power was calculated by dividing the in-use energy by the number of hours the
appliance was switched on. The duty cycle was the average percentage of time the appliance was
running during each two-hour period. The in-use energy and power and the duty cycle were
calculated for all appliances that were consuming energy for heating and cooling, and for each day of
the season. The average values are shown in Figure 12-9 to Figure 12-13.
In summer, the in-use power, energy consumption and duty cycle were highest in the early
afternoon: about 14:00 local time for Brisbane, and late afternoon from 15:00–17:00 for Adelaide
and Melbourne. In winter, the period 15:00–17:00 marked the lowest consumption for all zones and
the power for appliances in Adelaide and Melbourne dropped with the winter energy consumption.
In Brisbane in winter, the power reached its highest peak of the day while the energy consumption
was at its lowest, suggesting that only a small number of heaters were switched on for a very short,
intense burst. This may reflect a high level of changing activity in Brisbane households at this time, as
suggested by the rapidly changing energy consumption described later in Section 12.2 and illustrated
in Figure 12-25.
Peak power for heat pumps averaged across houses was estimated as 3 kW from their nameplaterated power values (which were more readily accessible than those for evaporative coolers). Peak
power for evaporative coolers, averaged across households, was measured at around 1 kW by the
Ecopulse monitors. It was not possible to establish if HVAC systems were operating at capacity,
because of the inability to distinguish manual from automatic switching of the appliances, and
because in Brisbane the period set for evaluation in summer did not correspond to maximum usage.
However, the preliminary indications from Table 12-1 are that many heat pumps in Brisbane and
evaporative coolers in Adelaide may have been near capacity in summer, and likewise many heat
pumps in Adelaide may have been near capacity in winter. There may be some rebound effect in the
usage of evaporative air conditioners on the assumption that they are cheap to run.

12.3 HVAC selection
This section describes whether the distribution or characteristics of HVAC appliances used in the
houses in the study were associated with the NatHERS star rating, and therefore, whether they
might bias the assessment results.

12.3.1 DISTRIBUTION OF APPLIANCE TYPES BY CITY AND STAR RATING
Appliance Types and City
The distribution of appliance types across cities was predetermined for this study through screening
volunteers. However, demographic constraints made it impossible to create an even distribution of
appliance types. For example, Melbourne householders had an almost complete focus on gas for
heating and a strong focus on evaporative cooling, whereas Brisbane residents predominantly used
heat pumps for heating and cooling, and Adelaide residents used both heat pumps and gas. We tried
to ensure that at least one heating and cooling modality, the heat pump, was strongly represented in
all climate zones. Figure 12-16 shows how the principal modes were distributed across the cities.

Appliance Types and NatHERS star rating
It was necessary to ensure that star ratings were as evenly distributed as possible for each appliance
type to allow statistical analysis. However, no practical method was available to predetermine star
ratings for houses across a large population of volunteers in the three cities tested. Consequently,
we sampled by selecting houses distributed evenly according to their year of construction.
Figure 12-19 and Figure 12-20 show how star ratings were distributed across the heating and cooling
modes. Heat pumps were evenly distributed for Brisbane, but shifted to higher star ratings for
Adelaide and Melbourne, as many houses exceeded the NatHERS rating requirements. For this
reason, we included a regression analysis across all sample points to determine a slope for energy
consumption vs. star rating that would allow us to use better estimates for the lower star-rating
values.

12.3.2 DEPENDENCE OF RATED POWER AND COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE ON
CLIMATE AND STAR RATING
HVAC appliances were a key part of the assessment of the impact of NatHERS on house heating and
cooling energy consumption. However, they do not contribute to the NatHERS rating. Consequently,
any energy consumption dependence between star rating and HVAC appliance might be evidence of
bias in the assessment.
It was also of interest to see if there was a reduction in the rated power of the installed HVAC
appliances associated with NatHERS energy rating, because of a calculated reduction in the need for
energy at design conditions. This would not necessarily be correlated with energy consumption, and
would itself be a useful outcome.
To assess these two issues, we inspected the HVAC appliances for each house in the study and
obtained values of rated power where possible from their energy rating plates. Otherwise, we
obtained details of the appliance from specifications in the appliance operating manual or from the
Equipment Energy Efficiency (E3) Program’s website www.energyrating.gov.au, which provided
nominal COP values for most of the appliances.
Figure 12-21 and Figure 12-22 show that heat pumps in Adelaide had a slightly greater power rating
than in Brisbane or Melbourne, and that the COPs of heat pumps were constant across all cities.

Dependence of power rating on star rating
The assessment of the NatHERS star-rating impact on energy consumption also examined whether
the star rating had resulted in house owners purchasing lower-powered air conditioners. Values of
rated power were obtained, where possible, from the energy rating plates on heat pumps installed
at each house. Otherwise, details of the heat pump were obtained from specifications in the
appliance operating manual or from the E3’s Energy Rating website. No dependence of rated power
on star rating was found for Adelaide or Melbourne, but a significant reduction was found for
Brisbane of 0.37 kW per star at a significance level of better than 95%. The results are shown in
Figure 12-23.

Dependence of coefficient of performance on city and star rating
A concern relating to the assessment of star rating impact on energy consumption was that heat
pump COPs might be correlated with star rating, thus introducing a bias into the assessment. This
could be as a result of progressively increasing air conditioner Minimum Energy Performance
Standards, increased availability of higher efficiency models, and/or increased consumer concern for
the environment. We tested this possibility using a regression fit, and found no dependence of COP
on star rating (Figure 12-24).

12.4 NatHERS star rating and daily variations in electricity
consumption
We performed two assessments of the impact of NatHERS star rating on heating and cooling energy
consumption. The first compared average values of energy consumption below and above the BCA
star rating regulatory change. This produced results with unsatisfactory statistical significance, and
has been reported in Section 9. The second assessment used statistical correlations of energy
consumption with star rating over each of the summer and winter periods. This produced the most
significant results, and has been reported in Section 10.
A third assessment investigated air conditioner usage over a set of three daily time intervals. We first
describe measurements of daily variation in temperature and energy consumption, and then report
whether a reduction in energy consumption can be observed during three daily two-hour periods
(06:30–08:30, 15:00–17:00 and 19:00–21:00) for summer and winter. These results are reported in
Section 12.4.2 and aim to improve the sensitivity of the assessment of the impact of star rating on
HVAC energy consumption. The data also provides support for the regression model analysis in
Section 10 and the potential for further energy savings by better understanding the interaction of
ambient temperature changes with house thermal mass, insulation and ventilation.

12.4.1 DAILY VARIATIONS OF HEATING AND COOLING ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Figure 12-25 to Figure 12-27 show how the average electricity consumption varied throughout the
day in each city, along with the temperature difference between the house interior and exterior. The
figures also indicate the peak demand periods in the day in which it is important to assess the impact
of star rating on energy consumption.
In Brisbane, peak demand is in summer between 13:00 and 15:00, which correlates with high
outdoor temperatures (Figure 12-25). This peak does not match the timeslots in the previous
analysis (Section 12.2). Winter peak demand, which occurs early in the morning, is much lower than
the summer peak demand and is not sufficient to warrant further investigation.
In Adelaide and Melbourne (Figure 12-26 and Figure 12-27), peak demand in summer and winter are
comparable in magnitude. The summer peak occurs in the 15:00–17:00 period, and the winter peak
occurs between 19:00 and 21:00, with a smaller peak in the morning. These peaks are consistent
with the analysis in Section 12.2.

House temperatures and heating and cooling electricity consumption – Melbourne

In summer, the daily usage cycle remained substantially unchanged across all cities. In each city,
consumption started at a relatively low value in the morning, rose to a peak in the afternoon, and in
the evening dropped to a value between the morning and afternoon values. This tracked the BoM
weather station temperatures. The afternoon peak in consumption for Brisbane is much earlier than
anticipated in the original methodology.
In winter, two substantial peaks were observed at 7:00 am and approximately 8:00 pm in both
Melbourne and Adelaide. The heating energy consumption was very low, with a short period of
consumption at 7:00 am and a slow rise in consumption from 2:00 pm, peaking at 8:00 pm and
falling at 10:00 pm.
Figure 12-28 provides more detail on energy consumption during the originally specified midday
peak period for summer, and the morning and evening peaks for winter.

12.4.2 STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT OF ENERGY SAVING DURING HIGH USAGE
PERIODS
The assessment tested whether a reduction in heating and cooling energy use could be observed
during three high-energy-use intervals of two hours for each day as a result of star rating.
Measurements of heat pump and evaporative cooling electricity use were compared with a simple
model for energy consumption in a multiple regression analysis. The method is described in
Section 10. The results of these assessments are given in Table 12-2 for the impact of star rating on
energy consumption and Note: The energy coefficients were derived from a multiple regression of
energy consumed as the dependent variable vs. two explanatory variables: i) The difference between
the temperature of the external environment (BoM weather station) and the internal house
temperature (ΔT) and ii) the NatHERS rating (star).
Table 12-3 for the dependence of the temperature difference on star rating.
In Table 12-2, four results were obtained for energy dependence on star rating, with p-values £5%.
Four additional results with p-values £10% supported the results obtained with p-values of <5%.
Winter – house heating energy savings in higher-rated houses
In Brisbane, for the 92-day winter season, savings were observed of:
· 0.13 kWh m-2 between 19:00 and 21:00 at p<0.05.
In Adelaide, for the 92-day winter season, savings were observed of:
· 0.14 kWh m-2 between 15:00 and 17:00 at p=0.1
· 0.48 kWh m-2 between 19:00 and 21:00 at p<0.05.
No measurements were available for Melbourne, where gas heating predominated.
Summer – house cooling energy increases in higher-rated houses
In Brisbane, for the 90-day summer season, increases were observed of:
· 0.08 kWh m-2 between 06:30 and 08:30 at p<0.05
· 0.15 kWh m-2 between 15:00 and 17:00 at p<0.1
· 0.08 kWh m-2 between 19:00 and 21:00 at p=0.1.
In Melbourne, for the 90-day summer season, increases were observed of:
· 0.08 kWh m-2 between 06:30 and 08:30 at p<0.1
· 0.12 kWh m-2 between 15:00 and 17:00 at p<0.1
· 0.15 kWh m-2 between 19:00 and 21:00 at p<0.05.
The temperature difference between the house interior and the nearest BoM station
In Note: The energy coefficients were derived from a multiple regression of energy consumed as the
dependent variable vs. two explanatory variables: i) The difference between the temperature of the
external environment (BoM weather station) and the internal house temperature (ΔT) and ii) the
NatHERS rating (star).

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

141

Table 12-3, four results were obtained for the temperature difference dependence on star rating,
with p-values £5%. Two additional results with p-values £10% supported the results obtained with
p-values <5%. In summer, there was no significant difference in temperature in lower and higherrated houses. A temperature difference of 0.18 °C at p<0.05 in Brisbane at 06:30–08:30 was too low
to be considered. In winter in Brisbane and Adelaide, the temperature difference values were
significantly increased in the higher-rated houses.

In Brisbane, for the 92-day winter season, increases in temperature difference in higher-rated
houses were observed of:
· 0.67 °C between 06:30 and 08:30 at p<0.05
· 0.52 °C between 19:00 and 21:00 at p<0.05.
In Adelaide, for the 92-day winter season, increases in temperature difference in higher-rated
houses were observed of:
· 0.61 °C between 06:30 and 08:30 at p=0.1
· 0.95 °C between 15:00 and 17:00 at p<0.05
· 1.05 °C between 19:00 and 21:00 at p<0.05.
Temperature measurements are not assessed here for Melbourne, because heating energy data
were only available from gas bills.
Compared with lower-rated houses, higher-rated houses in Brisbane and Adelaide tended to use less
heating energy in winter, and in Brisbane and Melbourne they tended to use more cooling energy in
summer. While Melbourne higher-rated houses did show a significant increase in electricity use, it is
uncertain whether this is due to cooling energy alone, because evaporative cooling circuits can
sometimes also support non-cooling appliances.

KEY FACTORS AFFECTING THE STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT

12.4.3 SUMMARY OF THE ASSESSMENT FINDINGS
Assessment of the impact of star rating on HVAC electricity consumption
In winter in each city, higher-rated houses saved energy. However, some of this energy was
then lost by raising the temperature of the higher-rated houses. If temperature differences
had been kept the same in houses of all star ratings, then the higher-rated houses would have
used even less energy. We refer to this additional energy saving as ‘inferred energy’ in our
results. Estimates for energy saved and temperature rise were given in Section 10. The
dependence of energy consumption on star rating was also observed for specific time intervals
during the day:
·
·
·
·

In winter in Brisbane and Adelaide, the electricity used for heating was reduced and
the temperature increased by 0.5 °C to 1 °C.
Measurements were not available for specific time periods in winter in Melbourne,
where gas was the predominant heating mode and gas billing data was used.
In summer in Brisbane, heat pump electricity consumption was greater in higher-rated
houses for all three periods of the day.
In summer in Melbourne, evaporative cooling electricity consumption rose in higherrated houses during the morning and evening periods, but not during the middle of
the day. The lack of statistical significance at midday may have been due to the cooling
appliances operating at full capacity. The results may also have been susceptible to
interference from other appliances on the same circuit as the evaporative cooler.

Summer temperatures and energy consumption
In summer, house temperature differences for Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne were lower
than in winter, although the supply of thermal energy in summer was similar to or greater than
that supplied in winter. One likely explanation for this is the substantial additional sources of
heat in these houses, which may well be the heat contributed from electrical consumption by
appliances such as ovens. It would also be worth investigating other factors, such as ventilation
(e.g. open windows) that might render air conditioning less effective.

HVAC usage
While most air conditioners operated at full power, their usage time was typically between 25
and 50%. If air conditioners were used on average for half the days of summer, then many
houses with heat pumps in Brisbane and Adelaide would have been operating near 100% duty
cycle (i.e. near the limit of their capacity).

HVAC selection and star rating
·
·
·

The coefficient of performance for heat pumps was constant across all cities and did
not depend on star rating.
Heat pumps in Adelaide had a slightly greater power rating than in Brisbane or
Melbourne.
There was no reduction in heat pump power rating associated with the NatHERS star
rating in Adelaide and Melbourne. However, there was a significant reduction in
Brisbane of 0.37 kW per star.

Appendix A – Methodology
CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL METHODOLOGY
The methodology that follows is a modification of the original methodology agreed upon prior
to the commencement of this study. The need for significant modification arose when
reasonable assumptions made prior to the study were invalidated as the study proceeded.
These were:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)

A change from the original proposal to recruit climate zone 5 volunteers from NSW
The unavailability of registers or substantial numbers of records for energy-rated
houses in Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne
House plan acquisitions took typically from one month to a year, requiring that
measurements be commenced before plans were acquired
The non-Gaussian distribution of energy consumption in the sample population,
which instead followed an exponential distribution.

The changes principally affected the type of volunteer households that were recruited for the
study and the method of analysis as follows:
i)

ii)

The even distribution of star ratings across the volunteer sample had to be
achieved without advance knowledge of the star rating, so year of construction
was used as a surrogate. This resulted in an upward shift of half a star in the range
of houses being tested in Adelaide and Melbourne, as many houses exceeded the
regulatory rating requirements.
Volunteers could not be recruited as matched pairs for star rating against different
house types, or heating and cooling equipment, because it was not possible to
determine star ratings before the study commenced. We therefore used a
screening questionnaire to recruit volunteers, as far as possible, from a single
house type and with a balanced proportion of HVAC types appropriate to each
climate zone.
Given the non-uniform distribution of star ratings, the exponential or skewed
distribution of energy consumptions and the number of variables that could no
longer be organised as matched pairs, we decided not to carry out a direct
statistical test for differences between populations of lower and higher-rated
houses. We hypothesised instead a simple model that energy consumption would
be linearly proportional to star rating, and used multiple regression to determine
the goodness of fit to our data.

THE MODIFIED METHODOLOGY
The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE) asked the Commonwealth
Scientific, Industrial and Research Organisation (CSIRO) to ascertain the actual benefits and
costs resulting from the introduction of the 5 Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Housing from
2006 in the Building Code of Australia (BCA). In particular, this addresses the two research
questions:
1. “How effective has the standard been in reducing actual (not simulated) conditioning
energy use (heating and cooling) relative to houses constructed to earlier energy
efficiency standards, specified as between 3.5–4 stars in the 2003–2005 releases of the
BCA”?
2. “What are the actual benefits and associated costs of the 5-star standard relative to
the 3.5–4-star standard in terms of: construction costs, avoidable energy costs,
heating and cooling appliance costs and total lifetime cost”?
The aim of this evaluation of building energy efficiency standards was to collect and analyse
data to determine the past and likely future impact of changes to building energy efficiency
requirements. This was to provide an evidence base for future building energy efficiency
policy. The evaluation also responded to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the Private
Cost Effectiveness of Improving Energy Efficiency (report 36, recommendation 10.1) and the
National Strategy on Energy Efficiency. The evaluation results were aimed at resolving
uncertainties in the actual costs and benefits relating to the 5 Star Energy Efficiency Standards
for Housing and inform governments, building regulators and industry of the effectiveness of
the standards.

A.1

Outline of the task

The program of work investigated the efficacy of the house energy star rating standard in i)
reducing energy consumption and consequent greenhouse gas emissions and ii) the cost
benefit of this reduction. The approach to resolving these separate, but closely related
questions is given below.

A.1.1

RESEARCH QUESTION 1 – ENERGY USE ASSESSMENT

The first research question addressed the impact of energy efficiency standards on heating and
cooling energy in residential buildings, and asked:
“How effective has the standard been in reducing actual (not simulated) conditioning
energy use (heating and cooling) relative to houses constructed to earlier energy
efficiency standards, specified as between 3.5–4 stars in the 2003–2005 releases of the
BCA”?

Research approach
To determine how effective the house energy star rating standard was in reducing i) actual
heating and cooling energy and ii) the associated greenhouse gas emissions, it was necessary
to confirm the relationship between the NatHERS star rating and building thermal efficiency as

determined by the standard, for each house measured. This was done by comparing NatHERS
ratings against measurements of energy consumed by heating and cooling appliances in
209 households in Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne. A further 205 houses provided
supporting information using NatHERS ratings, energy billing data, temperature measurements
and surveys. The null hypothesis used in the comparison stated that:
“There is no significant improvement in thermal energy efficiency between houses
designed and built to a NatHERS energy rating of less than or equal to 4.5 stars and
those built to greater than 4.5 stars.”
The accuracy and precision of this comparison accounted, as far as possible, for the effect on
energy consumption of the independent variables that tend not to contribute to the house
thermal efficiency, including: climate, seasonal and diurnal variation, householder behaviour,
and the nature of the heating and cooling appliances. The resolution of the data was further
improved by classifying heating and cooling equipment into types and comparing the energy
consumptions of these separate sets against their star ratings. In the process of carrying out
these ‘normalisations’, the data analysis aimed to reveal a number of subsidiary relationships,
including:
1. Whether 5-star houses require less heating and cooling energy when heating and
cooling is operating. This is relevant to the question of HVAC efficiency improvements.
2. Whether 5-star houses require less heating and cooling energy during the predefined
common peak heating and cooling periods of 6:30 am to 8:30 am, 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm
and 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm. This is relevant to the question of peak loads.
3. Whether 5-star houses require less heating and cooling energy during the heating and
cooling seasons. This is relevant to the question of overall house thermal efficiency.
4. The relationships between space heating and cooling equipment capacity and mode of
operation. This provides evidence-based characterisation of the relative efficiencies of
appliance types, capacities and modes of operation.

Key assumptions relating to heating and cooling energy consumption
Where possible, we tested key assumptions and compensated for them. The assumptions
within each group measured were that:
·
·

·

·

·

·
·
·

Time-dependent degradation in equipment heating and cooling efficiency was small
and uniformly distributed across star ratings.
Heating and cooling equipment did not usually run at full capacity for extended
periods. We tested this by measuring the average ‘in use’ power over half-hourly
intervals and compared it against rated power. However, it was not clear if this
assumption was valid for cooling in the summer season.
The impact of solar hot water heating on gas consumption was uniform across all star
ratings. This was not the case in Melbourne, and we excluded houses with solar hot
water from the gas heating group.
Heating and cooling equipment was in use during winter and summer. We excluded
from the study any houses where the heating and cooling energy consumption was
zero, but included houses where the controller was switched on, even if the heating
and cooling energy was very low.
Background heating, due to factors other than heating or cooling equipment, house
design or the ambient temperature outside the house, was uniformly distributed
across star ratings. We compensated for this by including a background energy
constant in a multiple regression model and by using the temperature difference
between the inside and outside of the house as an independent variable in the model.
Human behaviour patterns related to heating and cooling were similarly distributed
across star ratings.
Variation in the quality of house construction was uniformly distributed across star
ratings.
In each climate zone, the energy efficiency was assumed to increase approximately
linearly over the range of star ratings.

Measurements used to assess energy consumption and carbon intensity
The measurements that were used as the basis for addressing the research questions and
subsidiary information described above included:
·

Heating and cooling energy
This was determined by direct measurement of power factor, voltage and electrical
current through individual electrical circuits in the house meter box, as well as from
historical energy billing data. For gas-fuelled heating, detailed measurement was more
difficult, as reliance on gas billing data meant the analysis was restricted to seasonal
performance and could not be carried out for shorter intervals. This data is reported as
follows:
a) For each house, the average of heating and cooling energy was measured and
calculated while the heating and cooling equipment was operating, during the
heating and cooling season, for pre-defined periods of time each day. This
provided data on the degree to which heating and cooling appliances were
operating near their rated capacity.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

151

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

b) For each house, the average of heating and cooling energy was also measured and
calculated during the heating and cooling season for the same pre-defined periods
of time each day, whether the equipment was operating or not. This provided data
on the level of heating and cooling energy required to maintain comfort levels, and
this was used to assess the thermal performance of the house.
c) For each house, the total heating and cooling energy requirement during the
whole heating and cooling seasons was measured.
These measurements were supported by seasonal records from historical and ongoing
energy bill meter data.
·

Factors reducing average, seasonal and peak energy loads that were evaluated as
possible influences included
d) house thermal efficiency, as evaluated from the rating process and supported by
thermal imaging
e) household occupancy and behavioural characteristics, using survey data and
temperature measurements from within the conditioned space as well as from the
nearest Bureau of Meteorology station. For example, if significant differences in
the indoor thermostat settings (the measured indoor air temperature) were
identified among different householders, a proper correction method was
designed to account for this occupant behaviour
f)

·

Relationship between HVAC unit size, mode of operation (inverter) energy
consumption and star rating.

Carbon impact of the standard
The DCCEE handbook ‘National Greenhouse Accounts Factors - July 2011’ was used to
evaluate the carbon impact of household space heating and cooling energy
consumption.

A.1.2

RESEARCH QUESTION 2 – COST EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT

“What are the actual benefits and associated costs of the 5-star standard relative to the 3.5–4star standard in terms of: construction costs, avoidable energy costs, heating and cooling
appliance costs and total lifetime cost”?

Research approach
The costs associated with improvements in energy efficiency were principally taken as the
increased capital cost of house construction linked to achieving the standard. In evaluating
construction costs and the cost effectiveness of the standard, it was necessary to consider
market adjustment vs. predictions. The associated benefits were expected to include:
·

Improved comfort for the occupants and the effect of house occupancy and use.
The temperature difference between the external environment and the conditioned
space was considered as a benefit without attempting to analyse whether the
householder could manage with less heating or cooling. Such an analysis is possible,
but would have required a radically different approach quantifying such considerations
as culture, health considerations, perception, and ability to incorporate behavioural

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

change, which were well beyond the scope of this study. The relationship between
energy consumed for a given temperature difference as it varies with star rating was
used and associated costs evaluated from i) energy billing data and ii) separately for a
nominal fixed average tariff.
·

Reduced greenhouse gas emissions associated with the level of ‘comfort’ achieved.

·

Reduced energy bills for 5-star houses compared with 3.5-4 star houses – initially it
had been hoped to carry out a matched-pair analysis based on occupancy, but the
sample numbers were too small and the quantification of occupancy too unreliable to
make this practical.

·

Household space heating and cooling costs were evaluated from i) energy billing data
and ii) separately for a nominal fixed average tariff.

Measurements used in assessing cost benefit and compliance
In evaluating cost benefit, it was considered desirable to identify specific aspects of house
construction, their compliance with the house energy rating, their likely impact on improved
thermal efficiency and their associated cost effectiveness. In this regard, the house assessment
was supplemented by the following physical measurements:
·

NatHERS re-rating of houses
All houses in the study were re-assessed using the same standard protocol and given
NatHERS star ratings. The ratings ranged from 2 to 6 stars. Heating and cooling energy
consumption was measured by collecting readings of gas consumption from energy
bills, and electricity consumption from half-hourly measurement of the electricity
consumption for heating and cooling appliances. The temperature inside each house
was measured in the principal air-conditioned living area and the external
environmental temperature and dewpoint were taken from the nearest Bureau of
Meteorology weather station.
There were no registers for NatHERS star ratings in Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne.
This was not anticipated and made it impossible to predetermine star ratings. This,
together with a tendency for houses to be built to higher star ratings than the
regulation required in Adelaide and Melbourne, meant that the range of star ratings
for our populations of house samples in Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne, was
shifted by about half a star to a higher range than planned for the study. We therefore
used regression analysis to determine the slope of energy consumption vs. star rating,
so that we could better estimate energy consumption for ratings below 4 stars.

·

Pressure testing
This was carried out on a subset of 20 houses in Melbourne – this principally reported
on air leakage and by inference thermal leakage and was carried out as part of
compliance testing.

·

Thermal imaging
The conditioned space of all houses was imaged, including those relying solely on
energy billing data and not fitted with energy monitoring equipment. The results were
quantified and de-identified and used to test the influence of thermal leakage.

A.2

Implementation

The study was required to recruit a minimum of 400 households across three climate zones in
Australia. These houses had their heating/cooling energy monitored for this study from the
beginning of June 2012 to the end of February 2013, and monitoring is ongoing to allow
follow-up studies. An adult householder representative from each house participated in a
socio-demographic and behavioural survey.

A.2.1

ENERGY DATA COLLECTION

Electricity consumption data was collected using direct monitoring of electricity at the switch
board of 70 houses in each of the three cities. No monitoring equipment was installed to
directly measure gas consumption, so it was inferred from sets of gas bills for each house
obtained from the total cohort of 415 houses. Sets of usable gas bills were obtained for 61
Melbourne houses and 33 Adelaide houses.
Electronic monitoring was done using a commercial energy monitoring system developed by
Ecopulse Technologies (Figure A - 1). The device was installed by a licensed electrician and has
a built in web server tailored for PC, MAC and iPad access. The Ecopulse units required a
permanent Internet connection and the system’s proprietary “Self DNS” feature allowed it to
be accessed over the Internet without the need for a static Internet IP address or third-party
Dynamic DNS services. A 3G mobile broadband router was used to allow remote access to the
unit.

Electrical measurements
Total electricity consumption, together with heating and cooling electricity consumption, was
obtained by measuring the current and voltage for up to eight sub-circuits, and the power
factor at the main circuit in the house mains switchboard. Total energy was calculated by
summing all non-solar sub circuits. Measurements were taken every half hour for nine
consecutive months, including the summer, autumn and winter seasons.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

154

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

Each circuit was fitted with a current clamp transformer (EcoFront EFCTL10CLS80A-1.2m) with
a measurement range rated from 10 mA to 80 A rms and a linearity over this range of less than
±0.1% (Figure A - 2). The analogue current signal was converted to a digital signal using Cirrus
Logic CS5467 Watt Hour Meters with a linearity of ±0.1% of reading over a dynamic range of
1000:1. The rated energy measurement accuracy was 2-3% (main channels) and 5% (subcircuit channels). The instrument met International Electrotechnical Commission, American
National Standards Institute, and Japanese Industrial Standards accuracy specifications. If
there were more than eight circuits, then where appropriate, they were combined in one
current clamp; for example, lighting circuits from the same phase could be combined. Where
three-phase circuits were used for air conditioning, a balanced load was assumed and only one
phase was measured.
The heating and cooling circuits were identified using three checks: i) noting the switchboard
label if available, ii) checking the diurnal and seasonal variation in each sub-circuit, and iii)
asking the householder to switch appliances on and off while the data logger output was
monitored. If solar power was installed, then no attempt was made to monitor total power at
the meter; instead, the total power was determined by summing the individual sub-circuits.
Other factors that impacted accuracy included software reboots and firmware upgrades. For a
software reboot, about 5 seconds would be lost. For the two firmware upgrades, up to
30 minutes of data could be lost. A system might experience two or three software reboots in
a month due to telecommunications or power failures. Two firmware reboots were carried out
on each unit throughout the nine-month monitoring period.

Temperature measurements
Temperature measurements were measured and collected in each house using two
Thermochron button cell data loggers (Figure 1-4). These were installed in the main living area
positioned in a reasonably well-ventilated area, on a wall high enough to be out of reach of
young children and pets, and away from any direct source of cooling or heating.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

155

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

The two Thermochron temperature sensor/data loggers were supplied to volunteer
householders, who were instructed in their installation. The installation was subsequently
checked by personnel carrying out the house assessment. Sensor data loggers were changed
over every 80 days by sending a package containing two replacement units and a colourcoded, stamped addressed envelope for return of the old units. A payment of $100 was made
to the householder at the end of the study for looking after the temperature sensor/data
loggers.
Measurements were taken at 60-minute intervals with the two cells synchronised and phaseseparated by 30 minutes. This gave an average temperature measurement of the conditioned
space at 30-minute intervals as well as providing data security. Each cell measured
temperature from –30 °C to +70 °C, with a temperature measurement accuracy of +/- 1 °C, a
resolution of 0.5 °C and a clock accuracy of ±2 minutes per month from 0 to 45 °C. The
memory could store 2050 temperature records.

Data communication
Data was gathered at the Ecopulse unit and then communicated using a router modem
plugged into the switchboard and connected to an external antenna. The modem became
inoperable by third parties once removed from the system. The Telstra 3G network was used
to transfer data to a CSIRO secure database. Surge protection was provided against power
fluctuations and a timer reset relay was incorporated into the modem power supply to allow a
reset every 24 hours in the event of a transient communication or power failure. Volunteers
were promised access to a secure internet web page at the end of the assessment. This allows
them to monitor their home energy saving. The same web page was used for rapid surveying
of patterns of energy usage that allowed us to determine characteristic signals, for example,
identifying HVAC appliance power circuits.

Data storage and validation
Data storage for the electrical measurements was at three levels:
i)

Local data storage at the data logger was updated every half hour in the Ecopulse
switchboard data logger and was available for inspection via an internet
connection.
ii)
Central data storage at a secure CSIRO server was updated twice a day via internet
connections. These daily downloads could scan back for historical records over
several days.
iii)
A complete data download from the household units to the CSIRO server was
carried out three times during the nine-month monitoring period. This was to
accommodate telecommunications failures that might last longer than a few days.
Such failures were commonplace in Brisbane during December and January, due to
extreme weather events.
Data summary logs were inspected twice daily. This allowed fast response to equipment
failures at any household. The three levels of data base storage were also cross checked for:
i)
ii)

Missing data due to power failures, householder absences, and on one occasion,
theft. This was done by testing all data points for loss of signal on all channels and
was generally determined within 24 hours.
Short-lived address conflicts that very occasionally occurred during
telecommunications failures in the early phase of the project. An upgrade to the
central polling software corrected this problem. The few errors caused by this

issue were corrected by checking for simultaneous step changes in value across
significant numbers of channels for each house, cross checking across the twice
daily and nine monthly data logs and cross checking average data for several
weeks before and after each suspected event.
False zeros caused by a firmware upgrade were corrected by cross checking the
daily and the back filled data bases.
Noise artefacts gave obviously extreme values and were removed.

CALCULATING ENERGY CONSUMPTION

Calculation of derived parameters
The physical properties that were used to assess energy use included:
i)
ii)

Total energy, expressed as kilowatt hours (kWh).
Rate of consumption of energy, expressed as either kilowatt hours per half hour to
reflect the smallest unit of actual measurement or kWh d-1 for general comparisons.
iii)
The rate of consumption (kWh d-1) divided by the conditioned floor. This allowed
comparisons with energy units in the AccuRate software.
iv)
The temperature difference between the main living area of each house and the
external environment.
The measurements were calculated as:
i)
ii)
iii)

iv)

Total values of energy consumed. This included errors related to missing data. Total
values were used where the actual measured value of costs and savings was required
by the contract.
Average values that excluded errors due to missing data. These were used for the
assessment of the impact of the NatHERS rating on energy consumption.
Coefficients of energy consumption or temperature difference against an explanatory
variable. These were used to determine how the energy consumption varied with
parameters such as star rating, temperature or dew point in assessments of energy
consumption across cohorts for climate zones or seasons.
Items i) to iii) were calculated with and without subtracting non-HVAC energy,
including:
· for heat pumps: the standby energy for heating and cooling appliance control
· for evaporative cooling: the subtraction of energy consumption for appliances
that shared the sub-circuit
· for gas bill data: the subtraction of summer from winter gas consumption.

The calculation of energy values with and without non-HVAC energy included was done
because although the energies of standby operation, or from auxiliary equipment, could be
accounted for in a regression analysis, they were possible sources of data noise and would also
introduce a systematic error into percentage or per unit results.
For heat pumps, the standby energy value was taken as the average of readings measured at
2:00 am and 2:30 am each day for the monitoring period. It was assumed that while the heat
pump controller might still be running, the heat pump would not be actively heating or cooling
at this time. This was consistent with a manual survey of energy consumption measurements
from Ecopulse units, covering each house in the study. The standby energy value was

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

157

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

multiplied by 1.5 to account for variations in the standby energy consumptions, while not
excluding the much higher values measured when equipment was actively heating or cooling.
For evaporative units, the energy consumption of auxiliary equipment sharing the sub-circuit
was estimated as the average half-hour reading for the entire month of October 2012, as we
assumed that the temperature was mild enough that no one would use the evaporative
cooler, but that other appliances on the same circuit would still be operating. This was
consistent with a manual survey of Ecopulse units, covering each house in the study.

A.2.3

ENERGY DATA NORMALISATION

NatHERS ratings assume a standard set of energy load conditions to enable comparison
between different house types. In order to compare loads effectively between houses, it was
necessary to take into account different appliance types, internal temperature settings,
conditioned floor areas and hours of operation. Collecting actual energy consumption data
meant that all of these predefined values were variables that either needed to be normalised
to allow comparison among the various cohorts, or else treated as separate cohorts. In the
absence of matched pairs, and because of insufficient accuracy in determining the
performance coefficients of different appliance types, we used the largest possible number of
samples for a restricted range of heating HVAC types, including only: gas heating, evaporative
cooling and heat pump heating/cooling. Temperature variations were dealt with by including
temperature as an explanatory variable in the regression analysis, and conditioned floor area
was accounted for by including analyses where the house energy consumption was divided by
the house conditioned floor area.

Appliance efficiency, type and power
Heating/cooling equipment rated power was determined either by examination of the rating
plate power consumption, or from the appliance manual, or from the E3 Energy Rating web
site. The rating plate was usually located on the side of the unit. The type of unit (e.g. ducted,
space, split) was also recorded. Efficiency values were also obtained from the E3 Energy Rating
web site. Where efficiencies were not available, a value of x3 was assigned to heat pumps and
of x6 to evaporative coolers.

Hours of operation
The assessment included a requirement to make comparisons of energy consumption at
common periods of the day (6:30 am to 8:30 am, 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm, 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm)
when heating and cooling are commonly activated. Comparisons were as follows:
a) For each house, the average of heating and cooling energy measured and
calculated only when the heating and cooling equipment was operating, during
the heating and cooling season, within the same pre-defined periods.
b) For each house, the average of heating and cooling energy measured and
calculated during the heating and cooling season, within the same pre-defined
periods, whether the equipment was operating or not.
c) For each house, the total heating and cooling energy requirement during the
whole heating and cooling seasons.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

158

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

These three comparisons served different purposes: (a) whether 5-star houses require less
heating and cooling energy when heating and cooling are activated (this is an indicator of
capacity factor); (b) whether 5-star houses require less heating and cooling energy during the
predefined common heating and cooling periods (hours); and (c) whether 5-star houses
require less heating and cooling energy during the heating and cooling seasons.

Behavioural
Each household undertook a survey to determine their socio-demographic and energyconsumption behaviour. This survey was carried out either at the time the physical inspection
was being undertaken or with a follow-up online survey at the household’s convenience. The
survey itself was brief and self guiding (that is, the residents were not interviewed by the
research team). The survey was used to help identify the occupancy profile of the household
(e.g. at home all day, home in afternoons only) and establish their energy consumption
behaviour and attitudes (e.g. did they switch off lights, did they use CFL lighting). An example
survey is included at the end of Appendix A. This example survey is based on work undertaken
for the Australian Zero Emissions House project and was refined and tailored for this project.

Registration
Registration of volunteer households was done via an online form following on from an
advertising and promotion campaign. A sample form is shown in Figure A - 3.

COST DATA

Building costs
Access to detailed working drawings allowed the construction variations to be noted and
recorded. Those construction items linked to thermal performance, such as insulation
upgrades, were identified and costed in both dollars at time of construction and in today’s
dollars. Construction cost data were obtained from industry references such as Cordell and
Rawlinsons.
Costs in today’s dollars were used to identify any reduction in high-performance material costs
that may have occurred due to higher demand: for example, the cost of R3.0 insulation batts
today versus ten years ago.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

160

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

Over the research period, changes have occurred in the NatHERS process. This means that a
house rated to 3 stars in 2003 would not necessarily rate at 3 stars today with the current
NatHERS. These differences were taken into account in the re-rating process and consequent
costing differences identified.

Operational costs
It was expected that improvements in the thermal efficiency of the building envelope would
translate to reduced energy requirements for heating/cooling. These reductions in energy
were to be translated into dollar savings being experienced by residents, taking account of fuel
type.
In addition, CO2-e intensities were also determined. CO2-e emission factors for fuel sources
vary in each climate zone, so appropriate factors were used in each climate zone.

National costs
The Regulation Impact Statement (RIS 2006-01) investigated the likely impact of changes to
the BCA as a result of the improved energy efficiency standards. The RIS assumed that 115,000
houses would be constructed each year and estimated that, over 10 years, the additional
construction cost would be about $429 million, but that there would be benefits totalling
about $546 million, in 2006 dollars. The report also anticipated annual savings in gas and
electricity consumption by 2010 of 507,145 GJ and 221,169 GJ respectively, and a
corresponding annual CO2-e saving of 87,109 tonnes.
An analysis was undertaken to determine the actual costs and benefits that have occurred
using the results obtained for the three climate zones only, including estimates of:
·

savings to date in gas and electricity consumption

·

savings to date of CO2-e

·

construction costs to date to achieve the standard, assuming the same build rate as
used in the RIS

·

costs of the benefits to date using a revised costing methodology that incorporates
information from the RIS, information from HIA and MBA members, previous CSIRO
research and historical costing data from industry resources, such as Cordell and
Rawlinsons.

Data processing and statistical analysis

A.3.1

APPROACH

The statistical analysis was required to provide:
·

sufficient resolution to determine significant differences in the energy consumption
associated with a fractional star rating, expressed as average, peak and total energies,
over predetermined time periods

·

estimates of the significance of data comparisons in a regression analysis

·

the analytic capability to assess compliance with the applicable BCA energy efficiency
measures.

The central problem was that the magnitude of the effect of star rating on actual energy
consumption, and the levels of data noise, were both unknown prior to the study. This made it
difficult to estimate the sample size required to discern an effect. The approach we used was
to take a closely related sample: the total energy consumption of 800,000 households in NSW.
Table A - 1 was derived from this study, and by normalising thermal energy consumption
values to these total energy consumption statistics, we calculated what size effect might be
identifiable using estimates of the smallest detectable difference between the two groups for
different sample sizes.

SAMPLE SIZE AND DETECTION THRESHOLDS

The data was originally intended to include both 3.5–4 and higher-rated houses in equal
numbers. Based on this, and the assumptions given below, the instrumented sample of 240
was considered sufficient to detect a difference in energy consumption between 3.5–4 and 5star houses down to approximately 33% of the maximum difference in consumption in each
climate zone. Where gas was used for heating, we made the assumption that the statistical
properties for its household consumption would be similar to electricity.
In estimating the sample size required, we assumed:
a) The standard deviation of the energy data sets was close to 50% of the mean values
derived from the NatHERS star-rating scale, based on a related but not identical data
set, the total household energy consumption for 800,000 houses in NSW.
b) The shape of the population distribution of heating and cooling energy samples during
periods of winter or summer was the same as for total house energy consumption.

<BIBLIOGRAPHY

This was later found to be incorrect, and the distribution was found to be
approximately exponential.
c) There is a thirty percent reduction in heating or cooling energy when moving from 3.5–
4 stars to 5-star rating as determined in the NatHERS star-rating scale.
d) An analysis method was to be used in which the energy efficiencies corresponding to
the star ratings were compared using a matched sample design. We were unable to
obtain the necessary matched pair samples, and instead used a multiple regression
analysis, with restrictions on the diversity of heating and cooling appliances so that
sample size could be optimised.
Two assumptions were not correct and required us to make significant changes to the data
analysis method. One was the assumption that energy consumption values would be
distributed normally, and the other was that star ratings could be determined in advance,
allowing an equal number of samples within the two star rating bands being tested. However,
the sample numbers proved adequate to make comparisons using regression analysis by
setting confidence levels at 95% and p-values at less than 0.05.

A.3.3

DETECTION THRESHOLDS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

Table A-2 shows how we estimated, for each climate zone, the detection thresholds for
discriminating thermal energy consumption differentials between 3.5–4 star and 5-star groups.
The thresholds were derived by using model data for the mean of the energy consumption
differentials, and comparing them with the total house energy consumption value to
determine their normalising factors. The standard deviations of actual (not modelled) energy
consumption differentials for each climate zone were then estimated by applying these
normalising factors to the standard deviation for total energy consumption. These standard
deviation values were then used to determine the relationship between sample size and the
smallest detectable difference for energy consumption differentials in each climate zone.
Table A-2 also shows an estimate of the confidence interval aimed for by combining data from
all three climate zones. It uses assumptions based on the study described in Table A-1.

DATA CHARACTERISTICS – SAMPLING AND DISTRIBUTION

It was not possible to select houses for an even distribution of ratings between 3.5 and 5 stars. Houses
were therefore selected by year of construction. The resulting distributions were approximately Gaussian.
After the houses and ratings had been evaluated, a significant proportion of ratings were found to be
higher than required by the standard in Adelaide and Melbourne. Consequently, the population of star
ratings was shifted by about half a star towards higher values in the range from 4 to 6 stars (Figure A–4 and
Figure A–5).
The energy consumption distribution was also non Gaussian. In Adelaide and Brisbane, the distribution of
energy consumption data was skewed, with the number of energy users increasing as their energy use
reduced (Figure A-8 and Figure A-9). This was observed in both heat pumps and evaporative coolers.

STATISTICAL TESTING

Data groups
The data cohorts used in assessing impact of energy ratings on heating and cooling energy consumptions
included measurements across:
·
·
·
·
·
·

Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne
the nine-month monitoring period from the beginning of June 2012 to the end of February 2013
two seasons, summer and winter
daily time intervals including 06:30 to 08:30, 15:00 to 17:00 and 19:00 to 21:00
a limited range of appliances, including heat pump heating and cooling, gas heating, and
evaporative cooling
two forms of energy consumption data acquisition, including bills and direct measurement.

The principal explanatory variables included:
·
·

star rating
the temperature difference between the main living area and the nearest Bureau of Meteorology
station.

The following factors were also considered, but did not have a significant effect:
· dewpoint
· quality of building construction
· householder self-reported energy efficiency behaviour
· floor area.
The influence of conditioned floor area was minimal. It is accounted for in the NatHERS standard. In
addition, the range of floor areas was within a factor of two (Figure A - 10).
The lack of a significant effect for householder energy efficiency behaviour was a limitation in the sensitivity
of our assessment. The influence of householder behaviour requires a much more detailed assessment
than this study allowed and is currently the subject of a separate investigation.
Other factors that influenced energy consumption, but were not included in the star-rating system, were
accounted for in the analysis, so that the specific influence of star rating could be isolated. Those included:
·
·

standby energy in all appliances
spurious additional loads, principally heater fans, for evaporative cooling circuits.

Selection of the statistical test
Regression analysis was used to fit a linear model of the energy dependence on star rating (ΔE/ΔStar). The
results for each multiple regression analysis are presented in table form, together with a discussion. The
data and regression predictions are presented graphically for illustration only. They may be useful to obtain
a general idea of the data, but in using them one should be aware that the predicted values may be nonlinearly distributed, because they describe the combined contribution of all explanatory variables, so that
coefficients cannot be simply deduced from the graph. Likewise, a data point may seem to be an outlier in
one component of the multiple regression prediction, but can be significant in another. For these reasons,
our principal focus is on the table values.
The analysis is split into linear fits for each explanatory variable in the table. The key parameters reported
are a set of coefficients, each indicating a linear ‘association’ or ‘dependence’ of the energy consumption or
the temperature difference with an explanatory variable. For example, a linear relationship between
energy consumption and star rating might be expressed as having a ‘negative association with’ or a
‘negative dependence on’ star rating, to describe the reduction of energy consumption as star rating
increases. Each linear fit has a corresponding ‘p’ value. As p-values decrease, the probability that there is a
significant association or dependence between the dependent and independent variable increases. In this
study, where p-values are less than or equal to 0.05, we consider the association to be significant at a level
of 95%. Where p-values were greater than 0.05, the association/dependence was not considered to be
significant.
We used two models (equations 1 and 2) to describe the relationships between energy consumptions ‘E’,
star ratings ‘Star’, and the temperature differences between the main living areas of the houses and their
nearest Bureau of Meteorology weather stations ‘ΔT’. We then used a multiple regression analysis to test
the proposed relationships against our measured data. The two equations describing the energy E and
temperature ΔT dependencies on star rating were:
Equation 1

E = ka.Star + kb.ΔT + kc

Equation 2

ΔT = kd.Star + ke

Where:
·
·

heating or cooling energy ‘E’ dependence on the NatHERS star rating (kWh d-1 m-2 star-1)
describes how the heating or cooling energy ‘E’ depends on the temperature difference
between the interior of the house and the nearest BoM weather station (kWh d-1 m-2 oC-1)

·

to either the NatHERS star rating or the heating and cooling appliances (kWh d-1 m-2)

the temperature ‘ΔT’ dependence on the heating and cooling energy (oC kWh-1 d-1 m-2)

·

kf

the background temperature difference associated with the background heat (oC).

The multiple regression evaluated the best fit for the six coefficients ka to kf that described the proposed
relationship. Each coefficient was associated with a p-value that assessed whether the coefficient was
inconsistent with the proposed model. Each coefficient was reported as a mean value with 95% confidence
intervals and a p-value. Provided their p-values were less than 0.05, the coefficient ka, kb and kd were used
to estimate on average how much energy was saved or lost in houses rated at 5 stars compared with
houses rated at 3.5–4 stars. The 95% confidence intervals give an indication of how much this energy saving
would vary in the population from which the sample was drawn.

De-identification and key points for ethical consideration

The ‘Ex-Post Evaluation of Residential Building Energy Efficiency Standards’ required the cooperation of
both householders and energy supply companies, by virtue of its emphasis on the need for experimental
data rather than modelling. It was a key requirement, therefore, that all participants in this research project
were aware of and adhered to the requirements of the ‘National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human
Research’, particularly regarding informed consent and the privacy of participant information. [2]

A.4.1

ENGAGEMENT WITH VOLUNTEERS

Householders were asked to make a number of commitments and allow a number of interventions for the
purpose of measuring household energy consumption and house thermal efficiency. In return, they were
offered advice, a nominal financial payment, and the opportunity to keep the energy-monitoring
equipment. Data relating to the household and energy supply companies were de-identified in reports for
the study, to preserve householder and energy company privacy.

A.4.2

HOUSEHOLD COMMITMENTS

Household commitments included:
·

monitoring energy and gas usage in the house (via monitoring equipment or energy bills)

·

monitoring the temperature inside the house (via small temperature sensors)

·

undertaking a lifestyle survey on how the house usage affects energy consumption

·

providing access to energy bills

·

providing, or allowing access to, house plans and energy rating (as held by the local council).

A.4.3

HOUSEHOLD INTERVENTIONS

The activities directly involving the volunteer households included:
·

Installation in the house switchboard of current clamps on the principal electrical circuits and a
data logger linked to a secure web site. The web site holds household energy consumption data in a
de-identified coded form.

·

Supply to the householder of two envelopes, each containing a temperature data logger to be
stored by the householder in the thermally conditioned space. These were exchanged three times
during the study. The householder was paid a nominal amount for looking after these loggers.

·

A morning or afternoon visit by two house sustainability assessors to measure key parameters
associated with house thermal efficiency. These personnel had accreditation as required by ABSA,
including appropriate police checks, public liability and professional insurance.

·

A survey in the form of a preliminary telephone briefing, followed by filling in a form available
either as paper or on the internet in the householders own time. The information gathered
included stakeholders' descriptions of when they use home heating or cooling, socio-demographic
detail relevant to the degree of consumption of energy, and suggestions the householder may have
for energy saving. Participation was voluntary and written informed consent was obtained before

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

172

the interview. Interviewees were free to stop the interview, refuse to answer questions, and
withdraw their data if so desired.

A.4.4

THE PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT

Engagement with the householder involved:
1. Identifying regions of high growth.
2. Advertising the opportunity via local media and in collaboration with local councils and developers.
3. Providing access to an information sheet and an internet or paper registration Expression of
Interest (EOI) form that included a number of questions addressing the necessary criteria for
participation.
4. Screening for participants that meet the study’s criteria for participation.
5. Sending out a detailed information sheet, application form and consent forms.
6. Acknowledging all EOI’s and applications to participate.
7. Setting up appointments for monitoring equipment installation and providing a verbal telephone
briefing.
8. Carrying out the installation and measurement.
9. Providing facilities for responding to the survey.
10. Making quarterly calls to discuss progress and any issues with the volunteers and to request an
exchange of temperature sensors.
11. Providing a final debriefing at the end of the study.

A.4.5

HOUSEHOLD BENEFIT FOR PARTICIPATION

At the end of the study the householder received the following benefits:
1. A nominal payment to acknowledge the householder’s care of temperature sensors.
2. A personalised report on ways the householder might be able to make further savings in house
heating and cooling energy.
3. A discussion of whether the householder would like to take over the use of the energy monitoring
equipment.
4. A discussion of whether the householder would be interested in further collaboration in new
studies of energy consumption.
Throughout the study, the householder was able to contact nominated CSIRO project scientists to discuss
questions relating to the study or relating to energy efficiency in the house.

A.4.6

CONFIDENTIALITY

No householder names will be cited in any reports or publications. CSIRO will de-identify individual
household and energy provider data and maintain these datasets in a de-identified form to preserve
householder and energy provider confidentiality. To this end:
·

The results of compliance testing and house energy rating assessments generated in the
performance of the Services will be de-identified and encoded and incorporated into the deidentified Contract Material and Generated Data Base.[3] It will not be possible for anyone,
including CSIRO, to reconstitute individual house or energy supply company’s identities from the
contract material or Generated Data Base.

·

A separate database in which individual household data is de-identified will be kept for holding
research data for the benefit of the householder and future research programs. This will not
include data on compliance testing and house energy rating assessments.

·

CSIRO will keep the de-identified data bases and key for encoding and decoding the data on
separate CSIRO-secured servers for a period of seven years to allow CSIRO to meet its obligation to
provide householders with relevant information in return for their participation.

Additional Data

A.5.1

HOUSE ASSESSMENT

The assessor checked the location of two temperature sensors in the principal conditioned space of the
house. A photograph was taken of their location.

Qualitatively assessing the house

A qualitative assessment of each house in the data set was made using the Android data logger as a
prompt. It took into account such factors as quality of insulation, presence of window furnishings, additions
such as pergolas, verandas and shading, trees, nearby buildings and the presence of pool or spa heating.

Thermography of walls and ceilings
The thermography test was aimed at providing a qualitative assessment of insulation; in particular, the
presence of gaps in insulation in areas that were otherwise inaccessible, such as walls. Each image was
automatically associated with a temperature calibration scale, a time and date stamp and an identifier
reference, which were recorded on the interview log.

Measurement sequence

1. At the end of the first heating cycle (for the thermal step response test) the Testo 'thermograph'
scanner was used to scan the external walls and ceiling, checking quality and consistency of
insulation. Areas for particular attention included:
· perimeter of the ceiling
· where the roof frame changes direction (rooms that step in or out, corners and groundfloor roofs on double-storey dwellings)
· rear projections or roof space with no manhole access, including cathedral ceilings
· around penetrations (lights, fans, power points)
· above or below windows/doors
· walls where lower floor roof butts into the upper floor walls on double-storey or split-level
dwellings.
2. Still shots/images were taken of the external ceiling and walls of conditioned spaces to assess the
quality of insulation. Images were captured to:
· show the overall quality of insulation (good or bad)
· indicate weak points in the quality of insulation.
3. A description was selected and recorded into the android/netbook to indicate insulation quality
(scale A to D).
· Poor: Inconsistent insulation coverage – lots of gaps or large gaps
· Average: Typical outcome, majority of coverage consistent – expect gaps/cold spots to
ceiling perimeter, around downlights, under heater platforms and tight corners
· Good: Majority of coverage consistent – only minimal
· Excellent: No gaps/cold spots in coverage.
4. Images were downloaded from the SD card in the Testo thermal imaging device (TTID) to the
Netbook, then deleted from the SD card, which was then returned to the TTID.
5. The naming protocol for images was: “RBEEsTherm_jobnumber_Room_Descrpt.BMT”.
6. Images were uploaded to selected secure CSIRO online location before leaving the site.
7. Batteries were recharged for the next visit.

Appliance auditing

The appliance audit included hot water, heating and cooling and other gas appliances only. Data was
acquired and recorded using the Android data logger, including a photographic record of power rating and
capacity notes from the rating plates for hot water tanks and heating and cooling services (air conditioners
and central heating). The appliance audit specifically included the following gas and electric appliances, if
they were present. Data was captured from multiple appliances if they were present:
1. Hot water
2. Ducted heating
3. Ducted cooling.
The following information was collected, where available, from the name plate of each appliance:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Brand name
Model
Input power (heating/cooling only)
Output power (heating/cooling only)
Capacity (hot water only)
Total hours usage/year entry, including the calculation formula inputs (Hrs/day x days/month x
months/year)
7. Total power (if stated on name plate)
8. Star rating.

Best efforts were made to photograph the hot water system and heating system where details were
otherwise unavailable.

The methodology was assessed and developed in conjunction with Association of Building Sustainability
Assessors (ABSA).

B.1

Guidelines

Ø Energy Makeovers will conduct an “initial screening check” of the documentation provided by
CSIRO for each household to determine whether there is sufficient information to enable Energy
Makeovers to complete a new AccuRate assessment of the dwelling.
Ø If the initial screening check reveals that there is missing information, and this ABSA-approved
rating protocol does not provide clear pre-determined guidelines to compensate for the missing
data in a consistent manner, then Energy Makeovers shall not commence the rating until either the
missing data is provide or the protocol is updated to allow consistent rating assumptions to be
used. Note: In the event that CSIRO wishes to apply protocol changes to the rating methodology
after an assessment has been completed, and CSIRO wish this work to be performed by Energy
Makeovers, this will be a contract variation and Energy Makeovers will provide a quotation to
CSIRO to perform such additional work.
Ø If there is insufficient information and this rating protocol does not provide protocols to
compensate for the missing data, then the plans will be referred back to CSIRO.
Ø Where missing information is covered by this protocol and, therefore, appropriate consistent
assumptions can be applied, then Energy Makeovers will accept the drawings, document the
assumptions made and complete the assessment (intended to be in a single session)
o
for example, window material/configuration, floor coverings, wall insulation or ceiling
insulation.
Ø Rating amendments to completed assessments utilising data collected during the on-site Additional
Data Collection (ADC) assessments may be made by CSIRO at a later date if deemed necessary by
CSIRO. Note: Should CSIRO wish this work to be performed by Energy Makeovers, this will be a
contract variation and Energy Makeovers will provide a quotation to CSIRO to perform such
additional work.

B.2

Data entry into EM QA Sheet

Ø The Assessor saves a copy of the EM QA spreadsheet template to job file. Name: “RBEEs AccuRate
QA_<job number>.xls”.
Ø Save .PRO file following this naming protocol: “RBEE BaseCase <job number> initial YYMMDD.PRO”
(e.g. RBEE BaseCase 3004001 RG 120411.PRO).
Ø In the EM QA sheet is a checklist, which exists to guide the Assessor in the Quality Assurance of the
rating process.

The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

177

Ø Energy Makeovers AccuRate Assessor to use only a full set of working drawings to assess a house’s
energy rating in AccuRate. All relevant details for the rating are to be extracted from the working
drawings ONLY and not from the energy rating report. The energy rating report is for CSIRO’s
reference only.
Ø The Assessor extracts the following documentation from SharePoint, saves it to the secure EM
“RBEEs only laptop” or USB drive and records the receipt of all documentation below in the
AccuRate QA excel sheet (QA sheet):
· Working drawings, including
o general notes
o site plan: for north orientation and shading from neighbours
o floor plans: for dimensions and plan of house layout etc.
o elevations: for dimensions and plan of house layout etc.
o sections: for plan of house layout etc.
o window schedule: may not always be available (see generic rules)
o Electrical plan: often not available (see rules for down lights/exhaust fans)
o Energy Rating/Deemed to Satisfy specifications: ON working drawings if available
(especially for plans created after 2004)
· Full Energy Rating Report (for CSIRO’s use only).
Ø Enter “Zone Names” into checklist on QA sheet, using names as per plans
· Enter subfloor zone(s) first and
· Then enter zones in a clockwise direction starting from the zone that contains the front
door (i.e. the “entry zone”), unless this zone is a large open-plan space that extends into
the centre of the house, in this case start from the room to the left of the front door
· For second stories also start from the room above this first external door
· Record each room as one zone
· Enter roof zone(s) last.
Ø Any rooms that share the same “air space” (e.g. open plan kitchen/living) should also be combined
as a third zone (i.e. as Room 2 & 3) in checklist.
Ø Enter, in checklist on QA sheet, the dimensions (in metres to 2 decimal points. i.e. 2.75) of each
zone to calculate areas and volumes of each individual zone, using:
· Width dimensions (up-down on landscape-page)
· Length dimensions (left-right on landscape-page)
· Height to ceiling, (if raked use average wall height).
Ø Also record the following as required in the checklist to assist calculations and data entry (in metres
to 2 decimal points. i.e. 2.75):
· Floor height (from origin)
· Internal wall heights (m)
· Surface area of internal doors
· Surface area of skylights and roof lights.
Ø Checklist to be marked as “complete” and number of elements listed at various checkpoints as
mentioned in AccuRate Data Entry section (below).

B.3

AccuRate Data Entry

Ø Data entry is to strictly follow the following procedures; failure to do so will lead to errors and
misinterpretation of data.
The Evaluation of the 5-Star Energy Efficiency Standard for Residential Buildings

178

Ø Zones are to be entered in the same order as the checklist, commencing with the subfloor or entry
zone, whichever is first.
Ø Sequence of data entry is to follow the tab sequence in AccuRate:
· Project details o Constructions o Zones
· Shading
· Elements
· Ventilation.
Ø In the “Elements” tab, enter the construction and dimensions of each element, one at a time, in a
clockwise direction starting from the wall to the left of the front door (viewed from the
inside),following the order defined in the “Element type” drop down menu.
Ø Mark each as "Complete" on checklist before moving on.
Ø Save AccuRate data file regularly throughout creation process.

B.4

Project data

· Enter the RBEEs Job Number in the project name field.
· NO reference to the actual house address or householder details is to be made other than:
o Postcode
o Climate zone
o Site exposure: RULE: Check that it has been correctly selected (mostly “Suburban”
to be selected).
· DO NOT CHANGE GROUND REFLECTANCE, it MUST remain at 0.2.

“Generics” tab in EM QA Sheet if item is not specified on plans (based on ABSA Protocol see: “ABSA
Assessor Procedures: Residential Building Thermal Performance V0.7 1 May 2007” for more
details).
Ø Enter all construction data, following the order defined in the “Construction type” drop down
menu:
· For ease of use, and to avoid confusion on materials and naming conventions, a standard
set of construction materials in relevant libraries will be available for the RBEEs project.
· Additional library items will be available on request from ABSA; when this occurs, use the
library with the most recent date at the end of the file name (YYMMDD).

RULE: Roof Calculation: Use the current version of the RBEES_AccuRateQA_TEMP.xlsx spreadsheet
to work out roof area and volume, because the following calculations have been incorporated on to the
checklist tab.
Use Sin or Cos where appropriate for roof area and roof volume calculations:
•

Actual Roof Surface Area (m2) = Sum (horizontal roof areas, including eaves in m2)/COS(roof pitch)
Actual Roof Volume (in m3, at an azimuth of “0”) = Sum (horizontal roof areas, including eaves in
m2) x SIN (roof pitch)*(Horizontal distance to ridge m) x volume factor.

Volume factor = 0.333 for hip and valley, 0.5 for gable/skillion.

Rule: Roof Construction: if a roof has a small volume, the construction material selected should be
a flat roof construction.
•

For example, where a lower floor roof butts into the upper floor walls. If the highest point is
400 mm or less, select a flat roof construction. Due to the floor joist, this would leave
approximately 100 mm of the wall that goes to the “Roof Space”; this small section of “internal
wall” should be included as external wall.

Solar energy

Free energy from the sun commonly has two main uses in residential houses. The first is for solar hot water
systems, and the second is for electricity generation via a solar photovoltaic (PV) array. In addition, for
houses that have swimming pools, many use solar heating to warm the pool water: see Table A - 3.

SOLAR HOT WATER

Solar hot water systems are becoming increasingly popular in new houses. In Melbourne in particular, gasboosted solar hot water systems are installed in almost half the houses in the study. Much of this will be
due to additional Melbourne government requirements that new houses have either a solar hot water
system or a rainwater tank connected to toilets. The solar hot water option appears to be the more popular
choice, because it is the lower cost item and all houses require a hot water system of some type.
A preliminary study was undertaken of houses in Melbourne with gas hot water systems (both solar and
standard gas storage) to determine how effective they have been. Gas billing data was used and houses
split into their star-rating cohorts and the type of hot water system that was installed based on the survey
data obtained from the house assessment that was undertaken, see Table A - 4. The analysis assumes that
gas consumption for cooking is the same in both star-rating cohorts and the gas consumption for winter
heating should be less in the higher-rated houses due to their improved thermal performance.

and summer season. Indeed, the houses with the solar hot water systems use 42% less gas in summer and
a surprising 44% less in winter. Winter savings were expected to be less than the summer savings, due to
the reduced solar input. The higher-rated houses display a much more surprising result. Although summer
gas consumption is lower in the houses that have solar hot water, it is not as pronounced as in the lowerrated houses. Gas consumption in houses with solar hot water is down 18%, but is higher than the average
summer gas consumption for the lower-rated houses by 23%. Most surprising of all is that during winter,
higher-rated houses with solar hot water are using 12% more gas than the higher-rated houses with
standard gas storage hot water, and a significant 57% more than the lower-rated houses with solar hot
water.

The precise reasons why these differences occur are not known. However, possible reasons might include:
·
·
·
·

smaller solar hot systems on the higher-rated houses, thus giving lower solar benefits
higher consumption of gas for other appliances in higher-rated houses, e.g. due to greater use of
gas-ducted heating
poorly installed or less efficient hot water systems on the higher-rated houses
different hot water usage patterns.

We recommend further investigation into the performance of solar hot water systems to determine if they
are performing as expected and that compliance is being achieved.

E.1.2

SOLAR PV

A high percentage of the volunteer households had solar PV installed: 28% of houses in Melbourne and
Brisbane, and 45% of houses in Adelaide. This is significantly higher than the national average, which is 16%
of households. 4 The majority of the PV systems installed were between 1 and 2 kW, see Figure A - 11.
However, there were a significant number of large arrays, with more than 20% larger than 4 kW, resulting
in an average array size of 2.6 kW. In energy-efficient houses, such an array may be sufficient to provide all
electrical energy requirements.
Within each of the star-rating cohorts, the percentage of houses with solar PV was around the same, as was
the average size of the PV array.

Size of solar photovoltaic array

The high percentage of solar PV may be due to the nature of the volunteers that were attracted to this
study being households that are interested in energy efficiency, who have taken action to reduce their
consumption and/or their energy costs. Table A - 6 shows the average daily consumption for houses with
and without PV arrays. It reveals that, on average, houses in Adelaide and Melbourne with PV arrays use
significantly less electricity (15 kWh) than houses without (21 kWh). However, in Brisbane, houses with PV
systems use 4% more electricity than houses without a PV system.
Houses with PV in Adelaide use 34% less electricity, regardless of the season. This would indicate that
households that have installed a PV system are energy-saving households as well.
