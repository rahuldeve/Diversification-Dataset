Current primary energy use per square metre of floor area: 298 kWh/m² per year
The assessment does not take into consideration the physical condition of any element. ‘Assumed’ means that the
insulation could not be inspected and an assumption has been made in the methodology based on age and type of
construction.

Low and zero carbon energy sources
Low and zero carbon energy sources are sources of energy that release either very little or no carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere when they are used. Installing these sources may help reduce energy bills as well as cutting carbon.
There are none provided for this home.

Opportunity to benefit from a Green Deal on this property
When the Green Deal launches, it may enable tenants or owners to improve the property they live in to make it more
energy efficient, more comfortable and cheaper to run, without having to pay for the work upfront. To see which
measures are recommended for this property, please turn to page 3. You can choose which measures you want and
ask for a quote from an authorised Green Deal provider. They will organise installation by an authorised installer. You
pay for the improvements over time through your electricity bill, at a level no greater than the estimated savings to
energy bills. If you move home, the Green Deal charge stays with the property and the repayments pass to the new
bill payer.
For householders in receipt of income-related benefits, additional help may be available.

Energy Performance Certificate

Recommendations
The measures below will improve the energy performance of your dwelling. The performance ratings after
improvements listed below are cumulative; that is, they assume the improvements have been installed in the order
that they appear in the table. Further information about the recommended measures and other simple actions you
could take today to save money is available at www.direct.gov.uk/savingenergy. Before installing measures, you
should make sure you have secured the appropriate permissions, where necessary. Such permissions might include
permission from your landlord (if you are a tenant) or approval under Building Regulations for certain types of work.
Measures with a green tick
are likely to be fully financed through the Green Deal, when the scheme launches,
since the cost of the measures should be covered by the energy they save. Additional support may be available for
homes where solid wall insulation is recommended. If you want to take up measures with an orange tick , be aware
you may need to contribute some payment up-front.

Energy Performance Certificate

About this document
The Energy Performance Certificate for this dwelling was produced following an energy assessment undertaken by a
qualified assessor, accredited by AAA Energy Assessors Ltd. You can get contact details of the accreditation scheme
at www.aaa.co.uk, together with details of their procedures for confirming authenticity of a certificate and for making a
complaint. A copy of this EPC has been lodged on a national register. It will be publicly available and some of the
underlying data may be shared with others for the purposes of research, compliance and direct mailing of relevant
energy efficiency information. The current property owner and/or tenant may opt out of having this information
disclosed.

About the impact of buildings on the environment
One of the biggest contributors to global warming is carbon dioxide. The energy we use for heating, lighting and power
in homes produces over a quarter of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions.
The average household causes about 6 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Based on this assessment, your home
currently produces approximately 9.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Adopting the recommendations in this
report can reduce emissions and protect the environment. If you were to install these recommendations you could
reduce this amount by 5.5 tonnes per year. You could reduce emissions even more by switching to renewable energy
sources.
The environmental impact rating is a measure of a home’s impact on the environment in terms of carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions. The higher the rating the less impact it has on the environment.
Current rating

F (21-38)

Your home’s heat demand
For most homes, the vast majority of energy costs derive from heating the home. Where applicable, this table shows
the energy that could be saved in this property by insulating the loft and walls, based on typical energy use (shown
within brackets as it is a reduction in energy use).

Addendum
This dwelling may have narrow cavities and so requires further investigation to determine which type of cavity wall
insulation is best suited.
