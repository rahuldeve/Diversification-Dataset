The American Red Cross recommends that 
you consider purchasing a GENERATOR.  A

a Flashlight is, it can become a very im-
portant tool during and after disaster strikes.  
Every Family Disaster Supplies Kit should 
contain a Flashlight and spare batteries.  
Make your own kit or buy one at our Red 
Cross Store. 

The American Red Cross recommends that 
you purchase a FAMILY DISASTER SUP-
PLIES KIT.  A family will cope best by prepar-
ing for a disaster before it strikes.  One way 
to prepare is by assembling a Family Disaster 
Supplies Kit.  Once disaster hits, you won't 
have time to shop and search for supplies.  
Shop for a kit at our Red Cross Store.
