FREE Cell Phone Radiation Shield

Reduce the Harmful Effects of Cell Phone Radiation by Up to 87%!

Why You Need FreeShield

1. Cell phones  and other wireless and electronic devices 
are  extremely useful. Have you ever consider how youd 
get by without your favorite device?
2.  Cell   phones   also   emit   electromagnetic   fields   (EMFs) 
which   can   be  harmful   to   the   human   body.   Strong 
evidence   links   regular   cell   phone   use   with   anxiety, 
depression, infertility, brain damage, and even cancer.
3.  EMF   neutralizing   technologies   offer   the  best   of  both 
worldsthe   convenience   of   modern   technologies,   while 
reducing their harmful effects.
Visit  FreeShield.com  for   further   information,   including
scientific research, case studies, videos and related links, 
as well as information about solutions.

How to Test FreeShield

Many ways exist to detect the effects of EMFs, including:
1.  SAR (Standard Absorption Rate)  testing is extremely 
expensive and only measures effects of radio frequencies.
2.  Infrared   Testing  may   be   a   more   meaningful   testing 
method, since cell phones emit radio and microwaves.
3. Muscle Biofeedback  (or muscle testing) is a free EMF 
detection   technology   that   uses   the   worlds   most 
sophisticated   computing   device,   the   human   body   for 
feedback.  Muscle testing is so simple to learn and master 
that youll move from student to teacher within minutes. 
Youll have fun testing FreeShield with others. The looks of 
disbelief are priceless as your friends prove to be strong 
with FreeShield and weak without it. Expect skepticism until 
youve repeatedly demonstrated its effectiveness. And yes, 
FreeShield even stands up in double-blind trials.
Your   friends   will   soon   be   thanking   you   for   helping   them 
shield themselves from the harmful effects of EMFs.

How Does FreeShield Work?

In order to validate FreeShield technology, theres obviously 
a lot of explaining to do. Therefore, we go into great detail 
on our web site clarifying how it works.
The short answer is that the intricate pattern in the design of 
FreeShield   involves   complex  geometry  and   frequency 
equations.   When   Electromagnetic   Fields   (EMFs)   pass 
through   FreeShield,   their   vibrations   are   reprogrammed   to 
become less harmful and more harmonious to your body.

How to Use FreeShield

1. Print  all three pages of this file  using the  best quality 
color   printer   and   settings  you   have   available.   Using 
scissors,  cut   out   the   FREESHIELD.COM   strip  below. 
Fold the strip into four, making a single FreeShield, which 
will make it four layers thick. (This technology is more effective and 
provides more protection the more you use. Use more than four if desired.)
2.   Insert FreeShield  on your cell phone either behind its 
protective   case   or   behind   the   battery   cover.   FreeShield 
works regardless of whether its hidden or visible.
3.  Replace the battery cover and enjoy your newly-shielded 
device. Try the  cool tests  found at  FreeShield.com  to  put 
your skepticism to rest and  share this FREE technology 
with your friends!

What is FreeShield & Hows it Work?

FreeShield   uses   an   advanced   geometrical   design   to 
generate   a  full-spectrum   vibration.  This   full-spectrum 
vibration   helps   harmonize   and  cancel   out  the   harmful 
effects of disruptive vibrations, such as those emitted by cell 
phones.
Thorough mathematical research has proven that not only 
do different colors have unique frequencies, but the same is 
true of angles. By using a diverse combination of  colors 
and angles, FreeShield achieves a very broad frequency 
range.

The Fascinating History of Geometry

FreeShield   was   developed   through  research  into   the 
intriguing   field   of   geometry.   Geometry   and   its   related 
mathematical  ratios are  fundamental  to  many things we 
take for granted.
For instance, one of the most famous examples, the golden 
ratio, is found in most living structures including your very 
own body, architecture, art,  music, and even the world of 
finance.
The   design   in   FreeShield   resembles   a   fascinating 
geometrical design know as The Flower of Life.There is a 
brilliant documentary out right now created by one of the 
heirs to  the  Proctor and Gamble  fortune   called,  Thrive 
which shows (among many other things) how the Flower of 
Life design ties into almost everything.

Get the Whole Story...

To fully understand how important geometry is to universal 
design,   watch   Nassim   Haramein   in   his   breakthrough 
presentation,   Crossing   the   Event   Horizon.   Haramein 
explains the significance of geometry in a very entertaining 
and easy-to-understand way. He also presents a compelling 
and complete unified field theory (also know as the theory 
of everything) that fulfills a challenge that has eluded the 
greatest   physicists,   mathematicians  &  philosophers   of 
recorded history. And yes, this is all based on geometry.

How Does it Work If I Cant See It?

One   thing   you   might   find   curious   is   how   FreeShield 
technology  works   even   when   hidden  behind   your   cell 
phone battery cover, case or skin. To answer that question, 
we must realize that what the human can eye see is a very 
small fraction of the total light spectrum.
A good analogy to consider is that of a high-pitched canine 
whistle that dogs can hear clearly, but we cannot. Similarly, 
although you may have placed FreeShield out of sight, its 
really only dark in terms of our perception. The vast majority 
of the total light spectrum  is still interacting with FreeShield 
and its electromagnetic field (EMF) neutralizing effects.

What Else Do I Need to Know?

Some people are more sensitive to radiation than others. If 
you are currently free from obvious symptoms of cell phone 
radiation  (headaches,   excessive   heat   ear/face,   red   eyes, 
etc.) then a single application of FreeShield may be all you 
need.
People   who   are   more  sensitive  to   radiation   may   require 
several   strips   of   FreeShield   or   may   wish   to   use   a 
complementary   EMF-shielding   technology   as   well. In   this 
regard, you have many options available. SARshield is an 
excellent   cell   phone   product   that   I   use   personally.   Using 
more FreeShield technology may also prove helpful to you. 
Click here to download more free samples of FreeShield in 
various sizes that you can use around your home, at work or 
in the car.
There   is   good   reason   to   also   be   concerned   about   the 
cumulative affects of the radiation you have already been 
exposed to. Fortunately, there is hope. Pick up a copy of the 
book, Clear Body, Clear Mind to learn how to eliminate the 
accumulated radiation from your body.

Enjoy Your FreeShield!

Flourish and prosper,
Craig Brockie, Founder
