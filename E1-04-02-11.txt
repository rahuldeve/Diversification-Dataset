Summary

Global warming might aggravate stress from already existing factors (including
acidification, rising tropospheric oxidant levels, stratospheric ozone depletion, the flux
of heavy metals in soils and natural waters). Current international policies and
protocols, such as those for sulfur and nitrogen emission reductions would need reassessment. Also, risk assessments for a range of chemicals used in agriculture and
silviculture might have to be re-evaluated. In general, even if the cycling of substances
that act on the health of populations, and on the vitality of ecological systems, is not
directly sensitive to climate change, these substances may nevertheless be climatechange sensitive if they are closely linked to organic compounds in soils and waters.
This is because the turnover of organic compounds is directly sensitive to change in
meteorological factors. Effects of global warming on the flux, behavior, fate, and effects
of toxic metals and other substances in the environment might be of special concern in
Eastern and Central Europe, and other regions with “hot-spot” areas, in particular if
climate change manifests itself regionally as shifts in the frequency, intensity, and
duration of weather anomalies.
However, these are issues that have been poorly studied so far. Therefore, research on
the mechanisms, processes, and interactions involved is of high priority. Until
knowledge gaps are narrowed, risk perceptions based on the precautionary principle
should be adopted for assessing the effects of global warming on environmental
pollution.

Globalizing the environmental policy agenda must not divert attention from concerns
about unresolved, regional environmental problems. Global warming, albeit with
unclear manifestations in regional and local climates, is likely to aggravate impacts from
already existing environmental stress (including acidification, rising tropospheric
oxidant levels, stratospheric ozone depletion, the flux of heavy metals in soils and
waters). Among the first scientists to analyze these potential problems in some depth
was Oppenheimer, in the late 1980s. In terms of noticeable awareness raising and
policy-making, the issue area was first addressed by the German Parliament in 1989; see
Figure 1 for a simplified illustration of connections between some of the many
environmental impact categories that interact with global warming. Impact categories
can be aggravated by, as well as aggravate, climate change (meteorological change). A
wide range of climate-forcing substances (CO – carbon monoxide, NOx – nitrogen
oxides, CO2 – carbon dioxide, CFCs – chlorofluorocarbons (freons), N2O – nitrous
oxide, halons – CFC-like substances containing bromine instead of chlorine, CCl4 and
CH3CCl3 – various chlorine-containing substances, CH4 – methane, and several more)
are involved in these interactions, directly or indirectly. Among a multitude of complex
linkages, an example is the case wherein global warming (which implies an average
warming of the troposphere, and an average cooling of the stratosphere) contributes to a
lower temperature in the stratosphere, the ozone content of which then becomes more
prone to destruction by chlorine; this is because lower stratospheric temperatures
provide for an increasing occurrence of polar stratospheric cloud-particles, the surfaces
of which interact with the ozone-depletion process. This, in turn, increases the amount
of ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earths ground-near atmosphere, in turn leading to
increased potential for build-up of photochemical oxidants that can affect forest growth.
Reduced forest growth, in turn, implies a diminished capacity for vegetational uptake of
carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. The greenhouse effect can then increase,
leading to further cooling of the stratosphere, and thus to increasing UV-light
penetration generating further increases of oxidants that affect forest growth, etc., hence
this is an example of the potential for a vicious cycle between climate change, groundnear pollution, and natural resources deterioration.
Since the above illustration first appeared (Study Commission of the 11th German
Parliament, Preventive Measures to Protect the Earth’s Atmosphere, Bonn 1989) the
number of observed and potential feedback linkages between the above realms
(greenhouse effect, stratospheric ozone depletion, modifications of tropospheric
chemistry) and many additional realms (aerosols, land use, demographic change
including increasing coastal-zone urbanization, and others) has increased substantially.
At the same time, several linkages have been understood to be much more complex than
expected. One example is the role of atmospheric aerosols, a major factor behind
recently revised climate-change scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
Working Groups’ Third Assessment Reports, 2001).
For example, external contributions to the deposition of contaminants, as well as of
compounds from natural sources, are determined, among other things, by large-scale
wind patterns and other climatic factors. Some of these factors, such as gale frequency,
may already be changing. Were global warming to underpin such factors, a much

debated but not yet fully resolved issue, current international policies and protocols for
sulfur and nitrogen emissions reductions would need reassessment.

Figure 1. Simplified illustration of connections between some of the many
environmental impact categories that interact with global warming.

The tolerance limits that we have begun to try to quantify, in terms of "critical loads" for
sulfur and nitrogen, would change subject to additional and different influences. The
change should not be expected to be linear. For instance, increasing soil temperatures
would manifest themselves exponentially with ensuing effects on fluxes of mercury
from the soil to the atmosphere, and from the atmosphere to the biota. Also, risk
assessments for a range of chemicals used in agriculture and silviculture might have to
be re-evaluated.
2. The Problem of Indirect and Direct Effects
Among the most obvious areas of concern to societies worldwide, with respect to facing
the effects of climate change, is agriculture. Perhaps the challenges involved are often
seen as one of agricultural sensitivity to "global warming as such", i.e., to increasing
temperatures in terms of global averages. Very likely, this is a simplistic perception,
however. While agricultural crops and practices might well be fairly easily adapted to

not-too-fast changes in average values of meteorological parameters (temperature,
precipitation, etc), the real implications of climate change may very likely pertain to
shifts in the frequency distribution of these parameters. This would mean that
agricultural crops and practices will be challenged by a much more difficult adaptation
problem related to (perhaps rapidly changing) frequencies of weather anomalies. Coping
with this side of the climate-change problem could lead to increasing demands in
agriculture for energy, irrigation, transport, and chemicals, all of which are components
and/or activities that belong to the area of "traditional" environmental pollution, and that
can exacerbate such "traditional" and local-to-regional problems through increased
emissions of toxic, acidifying, or compounds that cause eutrophication.

Therefore, it might well be that indirect and difficult-to-predict pollution effects will be
as problematic in an era of climate change as will climate change itself. In addition,
among the suggested policy responses to climate change are programs for the
development and use of genetically modified organisms, which, unless thoroughly
assessed with regard to environmental effects and inadvertent proliferation, might
contribute additional complexity to the issue of global-warming effects on "traditional"
problems.
As the above example from agricultural sensitivity illustrates, if changing patchiness in
time and space would become a predominant characteristic of climate change, local-toregional effects of climate change would introduce special problems. For instance, the
occurrence and extensions of droughts, flooding, smog-formation, and fast melting of
snow in montane areas could substantially increase the risks to human health as well as
societal infrastructures and the vitality of ecosystems. However, the predictive
capability of climate models in terms of temporal and spatial resolution is currently
insufficient to enable in-depth analysis of the patchiness problem. This, in turn, further
complicates analyses of global-warming effects on biogeophysical and biogeochemical
mechanisms, and processes that determine the flows and cycles of environmental
pollutants, such as heavy metals and acidifying compounds.
However, the above type of indirect and complex feedbacks between global warming is
little researched. Moreover, and unfortunately, the current understanding of direct
linkages between climate change and "traditional" environmental pollution is also
remarkably limited. The interaction is still weak between the three essential naturalscience communities that address, respectively, climate change, stratospheric ozone
depletion, and troposphere/soil/water contamination.
