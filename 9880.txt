Most diseases are the consequence of the breakdown of cellular
processes, but the relationships among genetic/epigenetic defects,
the molecular interaction networks underlying them, and the disease
phenotypes remain poorly understood. To gain insights into such
relationships, here we constructed a bipartite human disease associ-
ation network in which nodes are diseases and two diseases are
linked if mutated enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent
metabolic reactions. We find that connected disease pairs display
higher correlated reaction flux rate, corresponding enzyme-encoding
gene coexpression, and higher comorbidity than those that have no
metabolic link between them. Furthermore, the more connected a
disease is to other diseases, the higher is its prevalence and associated
mortality rate. The network topology-based approach also helps to
uncover potential mechanisms that contribute to their shared patho-
physiology. Thus, the structure and modeled function of the human
metabolic network can provide insights into disease comorbidity,
with potentially important consequences for disease diagnosis and
prevention.

An important challenge of contemporary biology and medicine

is to establish the relationship between disease phenotypes and
disruptions in the underlying cellular functions (18). In the past
decades, huge efforts have been devoted to a gene-based approach,
identifying the specific genetic defects that, together with single
nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations, predispose
an individual to disease. However, it is increasingly understood that
such an approach, although enormously successful, is far from
sufficient, especially because most cellular components exert their
function through intricate networks of regulatory, metabolic, and
protein interactions (914). Therefore, the impact of different (and
often disease-causing) genetic and epigenetic variations are not
restricted but may spread in the intracellular network, affecting the
activity and/or function of gene products that otherwise carry no
defects. Because of these complex interdependencies among a cells
molecular components, the possibility of deep functional and causal
relationships between apparently distinct disease phenotypes is
apparent. Indeed, certain diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, or
Gaucher disease and Parkinson disease, often cooccur in the same
individual, sometimes one being considered a significant risk factor
for the other.

From this perspective, metabolism-related diseases are of special
interest because high-quality molecular interaction maps exist for
human cell metabolism (15, 16), providing strict flux-based depen-
dencies between reactions processing the same metabolite (17), and
earlier attempts to uncover disease dependencies based on shared
genes have been shown to be inefficient in grouping metabolic
diseases (18). Classical metabolic diseases are associated with
mutations that cause a metabolic enzyme to be nonexpressed,
inactive, or functionally compromised. The disease phenotypes
themselves are usually the consequence of the cells inability to
break down a metabolic substrate that is toxic above a threshold
concentration or to produce a substrate that is essential for the cells
normal function. Indeed, metabolic disorders are often classified by
the phenotype or the particular type of building block that is
affected, with broad categories including disorders of carbohydrate,

amino acid, or fatty acid metabolism, organic acidemias, lysosomal
storage diseases, and so on. However, the effect of these enzyme
defects (especially in their more subtle forms) may not always be
confined to the metabolic reactions they catalyze. Cellular metab-
olism represents the integrated interconversion of thousands of
metabolic substrates through enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reac-
tions (16, 1921). Thus, sets of consecutive reactions are function-
ally interrelated, and their activities (i.e. their flux rates) to a certain
degree synchronized. A consequence of this interdependency is that
an enzyme defect that leads to a failure at one reaction may
potentially affect the fluxes of one or several subsequent reactions
(22). Importantly, such cascading effects may also couple the
metabolic diseases that are associated with subsequent reactions,
resulting in comorbidity effects (meaning that diverse disease
phenotypes are coexpressed). Therefore, the association between
diseases and specific biochemical reactions may lead to direct
connections between diseases associated with the same pathway.
See supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 for information on disease
reaction relationships.

Here, we aim to test to what degree the known metabolic
network-based coupling between diseases associated with enzymes
is amplified in the human population, emerging as detectable
comorbidity effects between diseases. We construct a metabolic
disease network in which two disorders are connected if they are
linked to potentially correlated reactions. We then test the validity
of the proposed metabolic links between diseases by examining
mRNA level correlations among their enzymes. We also explore to
what degree the predicted relationships between often distinct
phenotypes result in detectable comorbidity patterns in patients.
Our results demonstrate that the predicted links among diseases are
frequently observed in patients and that the underlying disease
network offers insights into the factors contributing to the mortality
rate of diseases.

Results
Construction of the Cell Metabolism-Based Human Disease Network.
As a starting point of our analysis, we used the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Ligand database (15) and a
database of biochemically, genetically and genomically structured
genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (BiGG) (16),
each representing a manually curated list of metabolic reactions in
a generic human cell and the enzymes catalyzing them. We used the
list of disordergene association pairs available in the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (23) to identify

corresponding genes are shown with orange background. (Lower) A local neighborhood of the metabolic diseases (blue) associated with the shown reactions. The gene
ENO3 encodes the enzyme catalyzing the conversion between phosphoenolpyruvate and glycerate-2P, and its mutation is involved in the development of enolase-
deficiency. The gene products of PGAM2 and BPGM, catalyzing the reaction involving glycerate-2P and glycerate-3P, are connected to myopathy and hemolytic anemia.
Then the two diseases are not only connected with each other but also linked to enolase-deficiency due to the adjacency of their associated reactions. (b) In the
network representation, 308 nonisolated diseases (nodes) are connected by 878 metabolic links combining the potential links predicted by KEGG and OMIM
reconstructions. The color of the nodes indicates the disease class (see SI Text and Dataset S1), and node size is proportional to the prevalence of each disease in the
Medicare dataset. The width of the link between diseases is proportional to the comorbidity C of the two connected diseases. We show with red the links with significant
(P  0.01) comorbidity. Clusters of diseases associated with purine metabolism (blue shading), fatty acid metabolism (red shading), and porphyrin metabolism (green
shading) are shown.

the disorders associated with each of the enzymes present in the
human metabolic network (Fig. 1a), finding that in the KEGG
(BiGG) database 737 (1,116) among the total of 1,493 (3,742)
metabolic reactions are associated with at least one disease. Sim-
ilarly, 337 (378) among the 1,437 distinct disorders identified in
OMIM are related to at least one metabolic reaction in KEGG
(BiGG).

If the same substrate is shared between two metabolic reactions,
the scarcity or abundance of that substrate may affect the fluxes of
both reactions, potentially coupling their activity. For example, in
Fig. 1a, if the phosphoglycerate mutase is not active, the production
(or consumption) of glycerate-2P, and in turn of phosphoenolpyru-
vate, is expected to also be altered. In the following, we consider two
metabolic reactions linked if they process a common metabolite, i.e.
if they are adjacent to each other in a metabolic reaction map (see
SI Text, Dataset S1, Dataset S2 and Dataset S3).

The altered activity of some metabolic enzymes is known to be
associated with specific disorders. For example, mutations in the
ENO3 gene (that encodes the enolase enzyme) are known to cause
enolase-deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
by muscle weakness and fatigability. Similarly, mutations in the
BPGM gene (encoding one isoform of the phosphoglycerate mu-
tase enzyme) can lead to hemolytic anemia. Our hypothesis is that,
given that the two diseases can result from metabolic defects
affecting coupled reactions, linked by glycerate-2P (Fig. 1a), their
pathogenesis may also be related. That is, we hypothesize that the
occurrence of one of the two diseases in a patient may enhance
the likelihood of developing the other disease phenotype as well.
The sum of all such cell metabolism-based links among disease

phenotypes can be represented as a metabolism-based human
disease network, hereafter referred to as metabolic disease network
(MDN). In the MDN, each node corresponds to a disease and two
diseases are connected if the metabolic reactions they are associ-
ated with are adjacent, suggesting that their fluxes may be coupled.

Characterizing the MDN. The complete MDN is shown in Fig. 1b.
The network has a large disease cluster, often called the giant
component, in network theory (11, 2426) and several smaller ones.
The giant component includes 197 disorders of various disease
classes, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, Parkinson disease,
asthma, unipolar depression, hypertension, and coronary artery
diseases. The observed clustering of the MDN mirrors the existence
of the distinct metabolic pathways. To illustrate this, in Fig. 1b, we
highlighted with background colors the diseases associated with
some of the better known pathways. For example, according to
KEGG, human purine metabolism consists of 62 reactions associ-
ated with 33 diseases including congenital dyserythropoietic ane-
mia and nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. These diseases form
a visually distinct cluster, highlighted with blue shading in Fig. 1b.
Fatty acid metabolism, containing 34 reactions and 34 associated
diseases, such as trifunctional protein deficiency and syndrome of
hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP)
appears again as a highly interlinked group (pink shading in Fig. 1b).
The statistical characteristics of the MDN are shown in Fig. S2.
We find that on average, a disease is connected to about five other
diseases and that the degree distribution is much broader than that
of a random network with the same number of nodes and links,
indicating that there are considerable differences among the

Flux coupling and coexpression of metabolic genes. (a) To illustrate the use of flux-coupling analysis, we show the reactions that display directional
coupling (DC) with the reaction converting propanoylCoA to (S)-methylmalonylCoA. In blue, we indicate the genes encoding the corresponding enzymes, and
in red, we indicate the associated diseases. The production (consumption) of pentadecanoylCoA is performed by a single reaction, catalyzed by CPT2 (ACADM,
ACADS), and therefore the ratio of their fluxes should be a constant (full coupling; FC). On the contrary, propanoylCoA may be produced by four reactions and
is consumed by only one reaction. Therefore a nonzero flux of any of those four reactions implies a nonzero flux of the reaction consuming propanoylCoA, but
the opposite is not the case, which is DC. Because of the FC between the reactions producing and consuming pentadecanoylCoA, the reaction (CPT2) has DC
also with the reaction (PCCA, PCCB). (b) Distribution of the PCC for all pairs of metabolism-related genes and for the pairs of genes connected by metabolic links
based on the KEGG database. (c) Average PCC for all pairs of genes, all pairs of metabolism-related genes, genes connected by metabolic links, and genes
associated with flux-coupled reactions displaying DC or FC. The coexpression is stronger for connected genes and significantly higher for flux-coupled genes.

metabolism-based relatedness of various diseases. For example,
some diseases, like hypertension, warfarin resistance/sensitivity,
and hemolytic anemia, act as hubs (11, 24, 27), with links to 27,
19, and 17 other diseases, respectively. In contrast, the majority of
diseases have links only to few other diseases (see Fig 1b, and Figs.
S3 and S4). To a degree, this is expected because the studied disease
phenotypes span a wide range of conditions, from simple Mende-
lian disorders, such as enolase-deficiency (caused by deficiency of
a single enzyme), to highly heterogeneous complex diseases, such
as hypertension and diabetes (for which a fraction of the genetic
contribution is in the form of susceptibility alleles that are neither
necessary nor sufficient to cause the disease).

a fixed flux for j and vice versa (31) (Fig. 2a). For the BiGG
reconstruction, we identified 2,605 gene pairs catalyzing flux-
coupled reactions. The average coexpression (PCC) of the flux
coupled genes is 0.31, higher than 0.24 found for the genes
catalyzing adjacent reactions and significantly higher than PCC 
0.10 characterizing all gene pairs (Fig. 2c). We also find that
reactions connected by directional coupling show a significantly
higher PCC (0.36) than those fully coupled (PCC  0.17) (Fig. 2c).
Taken together, these results confirm the existence of functional
links between adjacent and flux-coupled reactions, suggesting the
significance of these links for the coexistence of the related diseases
in humans.

Gene Expression and Flux Coupling-Based Functional Relationships
Among Disease Genes. To examine the functional relevance of the
MDN, next we explored to what degree the predicted links between
metabolic diseases and the associated enzymes represent detectable
functional relationships. By using published microarray data for
gene expression in 36 normal human tissues (28), we computed the
Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the expression
profiles of each pair of genes in the metabolic network. We find that
the average coexpression of gene pairs connected by metabolic links
is higher than the coexpression between genes for which no such
metabolic link is known (29) (Fig. 2b and Fig. S5) with P  108.
For example, the genes ENO3 and PGAM2 (Fig. 1a) have a PCC 
0.66 with P  105, a 7-fold increase over the average expectation.
The causal relationship among diseases may not be limited to
those associated with adjacent reactions but could extend to disease
pairs that are associated via reactions whose fluxes are coupled (22,
30, 31). By using the flux coupling finder methodology (22, 3032),
we identified two types of coupling between pairs of reactions i and
j: (i) directional coupling (i 3 j), if a nonzero flux for i implies a
nonzero flux for j but not necessarily the reverse; or (ii) full coupling
(i N j), if a nonzero flux for i implies not only a nonzero but also

Comorbidity Analysis. Disease pathobiologies originate from a full
or partial breakdown of physiological cellular processes together
with subsequent (often compensatory) interactions among compo-
nents of the genome, proteome, metabolome, and the environment.
Therefore, the affected metabolic network activity is likely to
contribute to disease progression and comorbidity on the cell,
organ, and organismal level.

To examine whether the links in the MDN predict disease
cooccurrences, we analyzed the Medicare records of 13,039,018
elderly patients in the United States who, over the period 1990
1993, had a total of 32,341,348 hospital visits. These records are
highly complete and accurate and are frequently used for epide-
miological and demographic research (33, 34). The present sample
was abstracted from a complete set of all hospital visits of all elderly
patients (aged 65113) in the Medicare program, which is 96% of
all elderly Americans. The sample of 13 million hospitalized
patients has a mean age of 76.5  7.5; 41.7% were male, and 90.1%
were Caucasian (Fig. S6). Most patients were diagnosed with
several diseases during the observation period, a cooccurrence that
in some cases is accidental but is also often causal, i.e. one disease
increases the likelihood of the development of other diseases

(C.A. Hidalgo, N. Blumm, A.-L.B., and N.A.C., unpublished data;
36), perhaps in part because of causal effects rooted in the
metabolic network-based links among the cellular components
implicated in the particular disease.

To test whether the links of the MDN can be detected in the
population as significant cooccurrences between metabolically
linked diseases, for each pair of diseases X and Y, we computed the
comorbidity index (CXY, SI Text), which captures to what degree the
two diseases cooccur in the same group of patients. A positive
comorbidity indicates that patients with disease X are likely to
develop disease Y as well, whereas a negative comorbidity indicates
a potential protective effect from a disease Y in a patient with
disease X. We prepared a hand-curated mapping of the ICD-9-CM
codes based on the genetic disorders in OMIM by using an expert
coder and standard coding procedures implemented in hospitals for
assigning ICD-9-CM codes to prose descriptions of diseases (e.g.
converting diabetes to ICD-9-CM code 250), thus allowing us to
compute the comorbidity of each pair of diseases CXY in the MDN,
where X and Y are indices for the 337 diseases associated with
KEGG and the 378 diseases associated with BiGG.

The overall tendency of the diseases to cooccur is supported by
the right-skewed comorbidity distribution (Fig. 3a and Fig. S5),
implying that in general, metabolically connected diseases show a
higher than average comorbidity. The average comorbidity for all
diseases is 0.0009 (0.0008) for the KEGG (BiGG) reconstruction,
in contrast with metabolically connected pairs of diseases for which
the average comorbidity is 0.0027 (0.0023), three times larger than

the average for all diseases (P  108). Furthermore, the average
comorbidity of the diseases associated with the reactions whose
fluxes are fully (directionally) coupled is 0.0062 (0.0041), 7 (5)
times larger than the average for all diseases. In general, we find that
17% (16%) of all metabolic disease pairs for the KEGG (BiGG)
reconstruction show significant (P  0.01) comorbidity. This frac-
tion is elevated to 31% (28%) for the disease pairs connected by a
metabolic link and 28% for the flux-coupled diseases according to
the KEGG (BiGG) reconstruction, a highly significant enhance-
ment with P  108.

We also identified the prevalence IX of each disease, defined as
the fraction of the patients having disease X (Fig. 1b). The preva-
lence distribution is well approximated by a powerlaw with expo-
nent 2.0 (Fig. 3b), indicating that although the vast majority of
diseases are rare, a few affect a significant fraction of the examined
patient population. Hypertension is one of the most prevalent
diseases with prevalence 0.337 followed by coronary artery disease
(0.246), diabetes mellitus (0.167), and pulmonary disease (0.147).
Given this broad distribution of prevalence (Fig. 3b), it is plausible
that the more links a disease has to other diseases in the MDN, the
higher its prevalence is, given the increased likelihood that it will be
induced by other diseases in the network. Therefore, we measured
the correlation between the prevalence and the degree of connec-
tivity of each disease in the MDN (Fig. 1b), finding that the average
value of the disease prevalence (Dataset S4) increases with the
degree (PCC is 0.333 for KEGG, P  107, Fig. 3c). Thus, the more
connected a disease is in the MDN, the higher the likelihood that
it may contribute to the emergence of other diseases.

We next examined whether the comorbidity effects are limited to
adjacent reactions or whether comorbidity relationships also can be
discerned spreading over longer distances in the MDN (i.e. if
disease X is linked to disease Y, which in turn is linked to disease
Z, can one expect comorbidity between X and Z?). To address this
question, we define the network distance between two diseases as
the length (number of links) of the shortest reaction pathway
connecting them within the MDN, a metric often used in network
theory (10, 11, 24, 25). We find that the PCC between the network
distance and comorbidity is 0.062 (0.13) with P  108 (P 
0.0002) for KEGG (BiGG), indicating that the comorbidity of two
diseases decreases as their network distance in the MDN (Fig. 3d).
This finding suggests that although the direct or local links are the
most relevant for average comorbidity, measurable effects persist
up to three links, leading to a potential clustering of diseases
discerned in the comorbidity relationships. We also found that
reactions associated with diseases are active in more than one tissue
(Figs. S13 and S14). In particular, 27% (12%) of the reaction pairs
associated with diseases displaying significant comorbidity are
active in all tissues, from the KEGG (BiGG) database, suggesting
that the reactions associated with diseases are located in the core
of the metabolic network (37).

The widely different connectivities of various diseases (Fig. 1b)
prompted us to ask whether the more connected diseases are
associated with higher mortality rates (deaths) than the less con-
nected ones. Therefore, we quantified the mortality rate associated
with each disease, defined as the percentage of all elderly people
who died in an 8-year period after the diagnosis with the particular
disease. We find that the connectivity of a disease to other diseases
in the MDN and its associated mortality rate display a PCC 0.16
(0.07) in the KEGG (BiGG) database (Fig. 3e). A potential
explanation for this is that a patient diagnosed with a hub disease
is very likely to also develop the diseases connected to it, whether
they are diagnosed or not, and they together elevate the mortality
of the hub disease.

Previous work has indicated that although most diseases can be
grouped into a human disease network based on the genes the
diseases share, metabolic diseases are the most disconnected class
in this network (18). The main hypothesis behind the present work
is that the potential relatedness of metabolic diseases is better
predicted by the shared metabolites and correlated metabolic
reactions than by shared genes. Therefore, we next tested whether
metabolic links indeed offer a better measure of functional relat-
edness than shared genes by using multivariate analysis to quantify
the contribution to comorbidity of the various potential links
between diseases, distinguishing shared genes, metabolic links, or
flux-coupled links. We find that when considering all diseases
linked to metabolic enzymes (i.e., all nodes in Fig. 1b), the strongest
comorbidity effects are predicted by the metabolic links in the
KEGG database followed closely by shared genes (Fig. 3f). How-
ever, many diseases in Fig. 1b are not classical metabolic diseases
but are related to metabolic diseases through multifunctional
enzymes (6). To correct for those effects, we repeated the analysis
for only diseases that are classified as metabolic diseases in the
medical literature (shown as red symbols in Fig. 1b). For these, we
find that the strongest predictors of comorbidity are the metabolic
links, representing an equally strong effect in the KEGG and BiGG
databases (Fig. 3f). In contrast, shared genes and, surprisingly, flux
coupled enzymes offer a negligible predictive power. This result
supports our initial hypothesis that for metabolic diseases, coupled
metabolic reactions offer the best predictors for disease relatedness.

MDN-Predicted Significant Comorbidity Effects Between Diseases.
The MDN-based methodology allowed us to uncover 193 pairs of
diseases that are metabolically linked according to either the
KEGG or the BiGG dataset and also show significant comorbidity.
The full list is provided in Dataset S5), and the subset of diseases
connected in both datasets and showing the highest level of

comorbidity is shown in Table S1. Among the pairs of diseases
having high gene coexpression and high comorbidity are diabetes
and obesity, a well known comorbidity relationship (38), but less
obvious pairs, such as glutathione synthetase deficiency and myo-
cardial infarction, are also apparent.

We also find that a detailed analysis of individual disease pairs
can help to understand the way by which disturbance in the
underlying metabolic network may contribute to shared pathophys-
iology and suggest other potential disease-modifying factors. For
example, diabetes mellitus and hemolytic anemia show higher than
expected comorbidity (Table S1); in our database, we find 1,656
patients that are diagnosed with both diseases, in contrast with the
expected 1,215 if the two diseases are to occur independently (P 
108). Inspecting the relationship between the genes associated
with the two diseases, we find that some of the mutated genes
associated with them encode enzymes catalyzing adjacent meta-
bolic reactions (Fig. S7). Indeed, NADPH deficiency due to glu-
cose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency causes a reduction in
the levels of glutathione that is a main factor in protecting against
oxidative damage. In turn, impaired glucose uptake due to glu-
cokinase mutation may not only alter the threshold of insulin
release in pancreatic -cells but may also increase their sensitivity
to oxidative damage by reducing substrate flow toward the pentose
phosphate pathway (that produces NADPH). Thus, single nucle-
otide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of enzymes
directly or indirectly affecting the redox capacity of cells (39, 40) are
expected to be among the different factors that affect the pheno-
type and penetrance of either or both diseases (Fig. S7).

Finally, similar disease cooccurrence associations, linking the
metabolic dependency and the MDN to comorbidity, can be found
for many other disease pairs, such as hypertension and coronary
spasm (Fig. S8), glutathione synthetase deficiency and myocardial
infarction (Fig. S9), alcoholism and epilepsy (Fig. S10), and asthma
and atherosclerosis (Fig. S11), together indicating the MDN based
approachs utility in discovering comorbidity effects and highlight-
ing their potential mechanisms.

Discussion
A fundamental question in biology and medicine is to what degree
the topological connectivity of cellular networks is related to the
manifestation of human diseases, possibly leading to phenotypic
interdependencies. For example, metabolic fluxes are tightly cor-
related because of the stringent constraints of flux balance. These
correlations are bound to have an effect on disease cooccurrences,
a hypothesis that we aimed to test in the present work. We find that
(i) connected diseases show higher comorbidity than those that
have no metabolic link between them; (ii) the more connected a
disease is in the MDN, the higher is its prevalence in the population,
and the higher is the chance that it will result in death; (iii)
comorbidity effects are not only pairwise but can spread in the
MDN, exhibiting associations in high-order network links; and (iv)
for classical metabolic diseases, the strongest predictor of comor-
bidity are the metabolic links and not shared genes. Taken together,
these results offer strong support for the functional importance of
the MDN and its relevance to human health.

We note that the completeness of the MDN is limited by our
expanding knowledge of diseasegene associations. The associa-
tions used here are based on the OMIM database, which represents
the best currently available depository of stringent diseasegene
associations and continues to expand rapidly thanks to new tech-
nologies for identifying diseasegene associations. Such growth will
likely uncover the metabolic origin of new diseases, expanding the
MDN. Significant improvements are expected from more accurate
reconstructions of the human metabolic network, from the appear-
ance of cell type-specific metabolic network reconstructions, and
from improvements in flux balance-based modeling approaches
(17, 41). Although these improvements are essential, we do not
expect to significantly alter the basic results of this study, i.e. the

relevance of shared metabolic pathways to the cooccurrence of
human diseases.

The finding that 31% disease pairs in the MDN show a statisti-
cally significant tendency to cooccur in the population raises an
important question. Why do we not observe a significant comor-
bidity for the rest of disease pairs connected in the MDN? One
explanation may have to do with the presence of multifunctional or
moonlighting enzymes, which are enzymes with additional nonen-
zymatic functional activities, linking to the metabolic network
diseases that do not have a metabolic origin. For example, Fig. 1b
reveals that only 46% of the diseases listed in the MDN are in fact
classical metabolic diseases; the rest of them may be associated with
metabolism through such multifunctional enzymes. In addition to
the effects induced by these moonlighting enzymes, a number of
other effects, from the tissue specificity of metabolic activity (and
gene expression) to the role of cofactors, may also alter the impact
of the induced correlations, leading to diminished comorbidity
effects. Note also that the development of most of the diseases
depends on the contribution of a number of environmental (diet,
drug exposure) and patholophysiological factors, and thus an
impaired flux activity will often not be sufficient to initiate the
disease phenotype.

Finally, our definition of diseases as individual nodes, although
appropriate for monogenic disorders, leaves room for improvement
for complex diseases. To check the validity of our results under
more stringent conditions, we have repeated the measurements of
Fig. 3 c and e for monogenic diseases only, finding that the trends
reported in this paper survive for this disease class (Fig. S12). We
realize, however, that many diseases are rather heterogeneous in
nature. For example, diabetes can result from many abnormalities
including immune dysfunction, insulin resistance, or pancreatic
failure, arguing for the need to distinguish disease subphenotypes
as well. The current datasets do not allow such systematic study at
this moment, however. Similarly, as a proof of principle, in this

paper, we focused only on the impact of metabolic links on
comorbidity. In reality, a comprehensive disease network should
incorporate genetic, transcriptional, regulatory, coexpression, and
potential environmental links as well, offering a higher level of
detail and stronger predictive power.

Despite these methodological and biological limitations, our
results offer a comprehensive picture, demonstrating the impor-
tance of the large-scale structure of metabolic networks in under-
standing human diseases. Indeed, most functions of the human cell
are carried by complex networks of genes, proteins, and metabolites
interacting via biochemical and physical interactions. Thus, the
impact of disease-causing mutations is often not limited to the
products of the mutated gene but may spread and affect the activity
of other cellular components, causing apparently unrelated disease
phenotypes and resulting in comorbidity. Given the unknown
environmental,
lifestyle, and treatment-related factors that all
contribute to comorbidity, it is not a priori evident if the metabolic
network-based dependencies are strong enough to manifest them-
selves at the individual and population level. Our results indicate
that, in fact, such metabolic dependencies lead to detectable disease
comorbidity. Most important, we find that the systematic mapping
of such metabolism-based links between diseases helps us uncover
some critical disease comorbidities and helps to explain their
pathophysiology and metabolic origin. These findings suggest that
the network-based, top-down methodologies with the extant sys-
tematic large-scale databases offer an increasingly potent tool to
explore and understand the interplay between cellular networks
and human diseases (9, 35).
