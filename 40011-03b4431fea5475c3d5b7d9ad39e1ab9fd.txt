1. Introduction 

Although  forest  ecosystems  represent  only  about  9%  of  the  Mediterranean  regions  land  area  (85  million  ha)  they 
importantly contribute to poverty alleviation, socio-economic development, food security  and the preservation  of  a 
healthy environment. However, they suffer from increasing human pressures through urbanization, land use changes, 
firewood collection and grazing. Moreover, the impacts of climate change lead to an increased risk of forest fires and 
pests, but also growing problems of soil erosion and desertification. 

Mediterranean countries developed policies that should help to overcome these challenges and secure the sustainable 
provision of goods and services. However, the implementation of these policies through adequate forest management 
strategies and measures are often hampered, due to a lack of specific knowledge.  

In  this  context,  the  main  goal  of  the  project  Optimized  production  of  goods  and  services  by  Mediterranean  forest 
ecosystems  in  the  context  of  global  changes  is  to  incentive  an  improved  management  and/or  restoration  of 
Mediterranean forest in a perspective of sustainable provision of environmental goods and services. 
 
To this end, several issues are addressed corresponding to specific objectives: 

  Component 1: integrate the impact of climate change into forestry management policies and, to achieve this, 

produce data and develop tools regarding both the vulnerability of forests and their ability to adapt; 

  Component  2:  assess  the  socio-economic  value  of  goods  and  services  provided  by 
Mediterranean forest ecosystems, to support effective decision-making and strengthen actions 
to support the sustainable management of these ecosystems; 

  Component 3: improve modes of governance for forest ecosystems at territorial scale to promote local-level 
strategies  for  reducing  anthropic  pressures  on  these  ecosystems  while  ensuring  users  that  the  goods  and 
services on which they depend can be provided in the long term; 

  Component  4:  optimise  and  value  the  role  of  Mediterranean  forests  in  climate-change  mitigation  (carbon 
sinks),  via  the  production  of  methodological  tools  to  assign  monetary  values  to  ecosystem  protection  and 
rehabilitation efforts; 

  Component 5: promote coordination and sharing of experience between stakeholders in the sub-region via 
coordination  and  communication  activities  within  the  Collaborative  Partnership  on  Mediterranean  Forests 
(CPMF),  with  the  aim  of  encouraging  dialogue  on  common  strategies  for  climate-change  adaptation  and 
mitigation in the Mediterranean forestry sector. 

Component 2 of this project aims at the estimation of social and economic value of goods and services provided by 
Mediterranean  forest  ecosystems,  with  the  aim  to  support  decision  making  processes  and  to  reinforce  supporting 
actions to the sustainable management of ecosystems. To achieve this objective Component 2 of the project breaks 
down into four successive activities: 

  Activity  1:  Overview  of  methods,  tools  for  socio-economic  evaluation  of  goods  and  services 
provided by ecosystems across the Mediterranean region and develop methodologies to implement 
on the selected pilot sites; 

  Activity 2: Estimation of the economic and social value of goods and services on a number of selected pilot 

sites; 

  Activity  3:  Workshops  to  share  lessons  between  countries,  institutions  and  actors  of  the  region  and 

capitalisation trough a synthesis report of outcomes at regional level. 

 

This  report  summarises  the  outcome  of  the  first  activity.  It  is  divided  into  six  chapters.  Chapter  2  describes  the 
methodological approach of the study, and chapters 3 to 6 present the main results of the study.  

Chapter  3  is  dedicated  to  the  identification,  characterization  and  classification  of  forest  goods  and  services.  It  also 
identifies  and  briefly describes  the  role  of  ecosystem  goods  and  services  in  the  Mediterranean  region  and  the  main 
drivers of changes. Chapter 4 is dedicated to description of the characteristics and application of two decision support 
methods  (Cost  Benefit  Analysis  and  Multi  Criteria  Analysis),  which  can  be  applied  for  the  evaluation  of  forest

management alternatives. Chapter 5 provides the explanation of the basics of economic valuation and its application in 
relation  to  forest  goods  and  services.  It  also  reviews  the  characteristics  and  application  procedures  for  the  most 
common valuation methods and provides examples of their application in the Mediterranean region.  

Finally, Chapter 6 provides recommendations regarding the methodological approaches for valuation of forest goods 
and services to be used on the selected pilot sites.

2. Methodology used in this report 

In order to achieve the studys general objective  to acquire summarised information on the economic assessment of forest 
goods and services in the Mediterranean Region  a literature review and expert surveys have been conducted. 

2.1  Literature review  

A  literature  review  and  web  search  were  undertaken  for  all  studied  aspects  of  forest  goods  and  services    their 
classification,  characterisation,  importance,  trends  and  development  drivers,  and  evaluation  and  valuation,  with  a 
specific focus on the Mediterranean region and forests.  

Concerning  the  classification  and  characterisation  of  non-market  forest  goods  and  services,  various  studies  on 
terminology, classification and taxonomy of forest goods and services, as well as on the user groups, were reviewed 
(e.g., MEA, 2005; De Groot, 2002).  

The main sources regarding the importance of forest goods and services in the Mediterranean region was the report 
on  the  State  of  Mediterranean  Forest  (FAO,  2013),  but  also  other  sources  were  considered  to  provide  a  better 
picture of the situation (e.g., Merlo and Croitoru, 2005; Croitoru and Liagre, 2013).  

With regards to the evaluation methods and economic valuation of forest goods and services, the literature review 
focuses on the methodological aspect of the economic valuation and on a number of valuation studies for the most 
important non-market forest goods and services in Mediterranean. This literature was complemented with reports and 
publications (e.g., Daly et al., 2012; Pak et al., 2010; Jorio, 2011) submitted in response to questionnaires (see Section 
2.2) by the project partner countries. 

2.2  Survey 

Two  questionnaires  were  carried  out  in  the  countries  involved  in  component  2  of  this  project,  namely  Algeria, 
Lebanon, Morocco and Turkey. The purpose was to obtain information about previous valuation studies conducted on 
the pilot site and surroundings and about the importance of forest goods and services on pilot sites. This information 
was used to elaborate recommendations on methodologies that could be applied to value forest goods and services on 
the selected pilot sites. 

The  first  questionnaire  (see  Annex  1)  was  launched  at  the  beginning  of  March  2013.  The  corresponding  thematic 
experts in participating countries were asked to provide information about exiting valuation studies on forest goods 
and services, which were conducted on the selected pilot site or in surroundings. The respondents were also asked to 
provide the original document or a short description of the main characteristics of the valuation studies (e.g., goods 
and services valued, method used, data and data collection procedures, valuation scenario, short summary of the main 
results). 

The second questionnaire (Annex 2) was submitted by the end of March and was composed of three parts: 

Importance of forest goods and services on the pilot site. 

A. 
B.  Relevant change drivers on the pilot site and their impacts on the provision of forest goods and services.  
C.  Data availability.  

The objective of the first part (Part A) of the questionnaire was to gather information on the relative importance of 
different types of forest goods and services on the selected pilot sites. The area on which they are provided, who are 
the main beneficiaries and on the demand trends.  

The aim of the second part (Part B) of the questionnaire was to provide information on the most relevant drivers of 
change that can be expected on the countrys pilot site (already existing or foreseen), and how these would affect the 
provision  of  relevant  forest  goods  and  services.  The  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  main  drivers  affecting  the 

 

10 

 

provision, main goods and services influenced, and whether the impact on the provision is increasing or decreasing the 
availability of affected goods and services. 

Finally,  the  valuation  methodologies  to  be  applied  on  selected  pilot  sites  will  also  strongly  depend  on  the  data 
availability. Thus, in the last part (Part C) of the questionnaire, information about the available data and data sources 
was collected (e.g., indicators for quantification and economic valuation of main goods and services).

3. Forest ecosystems goods and 

services in the Mediterranean region 

The  overall  objective  of  this  chapter  is  to  provide  a  broad  overview  of  the  ecosystem  goods  and  services  provided  by 
Mediterranean forests that support and justify the need for the application of economic valuation methods to assess their 
relevancy.  The  specific  objectives  of  this  chapter  are:  1)  to  define  the  ecosystem  services  framework  and  apply  it  to 
Mediterranean forests, with a special focus on the multiplicity and typology of the goods and services these forests provide, 
2) To underline the vital role these goods and services play in Mediterranean economies, and how this role is frequently 
underestimated, and 3) To present the major drivers of ecosystem change and their repercussions (positive and negative) 
on the provision of forest goods and services, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with those changes. 

3.1  Features  and  classification  of  goods  and  services  provided  by 
forest ecosystems 

3.1.1  Goods and services provided by forest ecosystems 

Forests provide a wide range of goods and services to the society. Wooden forest products (WFP) (e.g. timber and 
firewood)  are  often  the  first  to  come  to  mind.  Nonetheless,  they  provide  also  plenty  of  other  benefits  to  humans. 
Some  of  them  are  tangible,  e.g.  the  non-wood  forest  products  (NWFP)  such  as  cork,  mushrooms,  game,  honey, 
aromatic and medicinal plants, etc., while others are intangible: the regulation of water and nutrient cycles, protection 
of  watersheds  and  soils,  sequestration  of  carbon  and  mitigation  of  climate  change,  protection  and  conservation  of 
biodiversity, part of our cultural and historical heritage, and place for outdoor recreation and leisure (Stenger et al., 
2009).  

In this report the terms "ecosystem goods and services" are regarded as outputs from ecosystems that benefit directly or 
indirectly to humans, and contribute to their well-being (MEA, 2005). 

The  multiple  ways  forests  contribute  to  human  well-being  can  be  described  according  to  the  ecosystem  services 
paradigm. So called forest functions, only become services to the extent that humans acknowledge them within their 
social systems of value generation (Nasi et al., 2002). Therefore, the novel aspect of the ecosystem services paradigm 
is  that  it  encourages  people  to  examine  the  links  between  ecosystems  and  human  well-being  in  novel  ways.  It 
emphasises  the  role  that  healthy  ecosystems  play  in  the  sustainable  provision  of  human  well-being,  economic 
development and poverty alleviation (Turner and Daily, 2008). 

3.1.2  Classification of forest ecosystem goods and services 

Efforts  have  been  made  to  develop  conceptual  frameworks  for  describing  and  classifying  more  rigorously  and 
systematically  ecosystem  services.  Each  of  these  frameworks  has  intrinsic  strengths  and  limitations,  but  none  is 
universally accepted (Costanza et al. 1997; De Groot et al., 2002; MEA, 2005; Merlo & Croitoru, 2005; Mantau et al., 
2007).  Among  the  many  classification  schemes,  the  one  proposed  in  the  Millennium  ecosystem  assessment  (MEA) 
(2005)  is  the  most  widely  used.  The  MEA  (2005)  proposes  a  specific  classification  scheme  for  forest  ecosystem 
services that identifies five main interrelated categories (Figure 3.1).

Forest ecosystem services 

 

Figure 3.1: The five main classes of forest ecosystem services (adapted from MEA, 2005) 

 
The resources category refers to all goods that may be obtained from forests (wood and non-wood); the ecological 
services are those related to protection of water, soil and health; the biospheric services are mainly climate regulation 
and biodiversity protection; while social and amenity services comprise of different types of recreational activities and 
the cultural importance of forests. 

Although  the  multiple  forest  ecosystem  services  can  be  categorized  to  facilitate  their  analysis,  valuation  or  for 
communication  purpose,  they  are  inherently  interdependent and  interactive,  as  part  of  a  whole  natural  system,  and 
relate to each other in many different ways that can be synergetic, neutral/tolerant, conflicting, exclusive, etc (Elmqvist 
et al., 2011).  

Furthermore, in most cases different ecosystem services appear simultaneously, and the overall benefit from such a 
"bundle"  of  services  is  much  higher  than  just  the  sum  of  the  values  of  individual  services.  Furthermore,  forest 
management activities (e.g. timber extraction, recreation, biodiversity conservation, etc.) might produce a variety of 
effects in terms of the provision of these ecosystem services. As an illustration, thinning can reduce water interception 
and  increase  surface  runoff  and  infiltration,  and  at  the  same  time,  it  stimulates  tree  growth,  and  the  appearance  of 
more species (increased diversity).  

Recent  debates  have  stressed  the  importance  to  differentiate  between  closely  linked  ecosystem  services,  benefits, 
functions, ecological processes and human well-being. Although the boundaries are not always clear, their identification 
helps to underline the mechanisms that underpin the links between natural capital and human well-being. Furthermore, 
distinguishing between intermediate and final products along the "service cascade" would also contribute to achieve a 
more reliable and realistic valuation of ecosystem services, avoiding "double counting" (Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007; Fisher 
et al., 2009). 

Figure 3.2 illustrates these relationships, where: 

 

 

 

Biophysical  structure  and  processes  refers  to  the  complex  interactions  between  biotic  (living  organisms)  and 
abiotic  (chemical  and  physical)  components  of  ecosystems,  and  to  the  matter  and  energy  fluxes  that  drive 
them.  
Ecosystem  function  refers  to  the  capacity  of  natural  ecological  processes,  structures  and  components  to 
provide goods and services that can potentially satisfy human needs, either directly or indirectly (Costanza, 
1997; de Groot et al., 2002).  
Services  are  outputs  from  those  functions  that  benefit,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  humans  (something  we 
consider  as  "useful"),  and  contribute  to  their  well-being  in  a  given  context  (socio-economic,  geographic, 
cultural, etc.).

3.2  Forest ecosystems in the Mediterranean region 

3.2.1  Forest cover in the Mediterranean 

In 2010, forests in Mediterranean countries were estimated to cover over 85 million ha, which represents around 9% 
of  the  land  area  (FAO,  2010)  (Annex  3).  The  forest  area  has  increased  by  almost  12 million  ha  between  1990  and 
2010,  i.e.  around  0.7%  per  year.  Nonetheless,  the  forest  cover  varies  greatly  between  countries,  being  higher  in 
northern and western Mediterranean countries (NWMC) than in Southern and Eastern (SEMC). 

3.2.2  The role of Mediterranean forests in the economy 

One of the key aspects of the Mediterranean forests that has been widely acknowledged is their multi-functionality. 
However, many of the goods and services they provide are not traded in traditional markets and thus do not appear in 
the official statistics or national accounts.  This means that forestry-related activities and  products represent a small 
share of the national Gross domestic product (GDP). In most of the Mediterranean countries the share is significantly 
below 1% (e.g.  0.93% in Lebanon, 0.50% in Turkey, 0.40% in Morocco, 0.06% in Tunisia, 0.02% in Algeria), and only in 
some it is over 1% (e.g., 1.5% in France) (Merlo and Croituru, 2005). Likewise, estimates indicating that forests from 
Middle East - Northern Africa (MENA) contribute less than 1% of labour force of countries (FAO, 2011), capture only 
formal employment and exclude informal workers and the poorest who depend on forests for subsistence (Croituru 
and Liagre, 2013).  

As Vincent (1999) shows, the value added, as conventionally defined for both industry and agriculture, is frequently 
overstated from a social standpoint, because a portion of each sectors operating surplus can be attributed to goods 
and services provided by forests. For example, forests provide intermediate inputs to other sectors, such as livestock 
grazing or tourism, but the value of these inputs is not recognised (Lange, 2004). Thus, not only the total benefits from 
sustainable  forestry  are  underestimated,  but other  economy  sectors  are  not  aware  of  their  dependence  on  healthy 
forests  (Lange,  2004).  This  way,  forests  and  forest  sector  are  commonly  classified  as  a  marginal  element  of  the 

 

14 

 

economy in a number of countries when evaluated under the GDP framework. This is especially problematic in the 
Mediterranean region which has a very limited timber production potential. 

This also means that those goods and services, that have an established market value (e.g., timber), have more weight 
in  the  decisions,  due  to  the  frequent  undervaluation  of  non-market  goods  and  services.  However,  different  studies 
show  that  timber  accounts  for  only  one  third  of  the  total  economic  value  of  forest  in  Mediterranean  countries 
(Croituru and Merlo, 2005; Pak et al., 2010; Daly-Hassen et al., 2012) while NWFP account for more than 40% of the 
total economic value of forests in the Mediterranean countries (Croitoru, 2007).  

3.2.3  Ecosystem goods and services provided by Mediterranean forests 

This section provides an overview of the goods and services supplied by Mediterranean forest ecosystems following 
the MEA classification presented in section 3.1.2. 

3.2.3.1  Resources: wood and non-wood forest products 

Mediterranean forests provide a broad range of tangible products, including wood (timber, fuelwood) and non-wood 
(food, raw material, etc.) products.  

Industrial  wood  serves  for  the  production  of  a  vast  number  of  products,  like  industrial  round  wood,  sawn  wood, 
wood-based panels, pulp and paper, particleboard, fibreboard, and plywood, engineered lumber components, softwood 
lumber, flooring, pallets, veneer, etc.  Fuel wood,  e.g. twigs, branches and trunks, but also residues or reused wood, 
are used for energy generation, i.e. heating, cooking, charcoal generation or alcohol production (e.g. methanol). As an 
illustration  of  the  potential  for  wood  production,  in  2010,  the  estimated  total  forest  growing  stock  in  the 
Mediterranean countries was around 9 623 million m3 (41% from conifers and 58% from broadleaved species) (FAO, 
2013). NWMC obtain significant incomes from timber production while, in SEMC, fuel wood is mainly used by local 
rural populations.  

NWFP are very diverse, and used for human or animal consumption, green chemistry, industry, whether in their raw 
form  or  processed.  Many  of  them  are  marketed  (in  formal  or  informal  markets)  or  have  the  potential  to  be.  This 
group includes food products (e.g. game, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, flower, roots, mushrooms, honey, royal 
jelly, beverages, resins, gums, syrups, flavouring and colouring agents, herbs/teas, spices, sugaring agents, acorns, alfa, 
etc.), health and care products (medicinal and aromatic plants, essential oils, dyes, sap, etc.), construction, insulation 
and  clothing  materials  (resins,  tannins,  bark,  fibre,  leaves,  lianas,  dyes,  etc.),  as  well  as  gardening  and  ornamental 
materials (plants, shrubs, wildflowers, composting material, etc.).  

In the Mediterranean region, many different types of NWFP are harvested (Figure 3.3), generating incomes and rural 
employment  and  incentivizing  sustainable  forest  management.  However,  to  unfold  this  potential,  important 
improvements  in  the  organisation  and  regulation  of  NWFP  harvesting  and  use  are  needed.  Currently,  in  most 
countries the access to NWFP is free and not well monitored. For, example an important part of the collected NWFP 
is used for self-consumption by the local population or is traded on gray markets, which is in particular the case in 
SEMC.

To underline the importance of NWFP, a few examples can be mentioned. Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, 
Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, France and Italy) are the main global producers of cork. In these countries cork and cork 
related activities are an important source of income and employment. Cork oak forests covered around 2.1 million ha 
in 2008 (Figure 3.4), but their area tends to decrease slightly, due to forest abandonment, deforestation, overgrazing, 
and lower demand for cork products.

Among other NWFP, mushrooms and truffles are particularly valued, and are collected for personal or commercial 
use. However, a large portion is traded on informal markets, resulting in the under-quantification of their real value. 
Stone pine nuts and cones (Pinus pinea), another NWFP of gastronomic  and economic significance, are harvested in 
France, Italy, Lebanon, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey. Stone pine forests currently cover over 0.75 million ha in 
the Mediterranean region.  

In Italy, Greece and Spain, chestnuts are harvested for human consumption. Argan fruits (Argania spinosa) are collected 
in  Morocco  and  Algeria  to  elaborate  health  care  products,  generating  activity  and  income  (see  the  Argan  research 
network in construction in Morocco). The alfa steppe (Stipa tenacissima) occupies an important role in Algeria, but its 
area has decreased drastically and it is being degraded at a fast rate, due to overexploitation for production of paper 
pulp, and by the traditional artisanal sector for basketry and weaving (Kadi-Hanifi, 1998).

Table 3.1, adapted from Merlo and Croitoru (2005), presents some of the most valued wood and non-wood forest 
products for the Mediterranean countries involved in the FFEM project "Optimize the production of goods and services by 
Mediterranean forest ecosystems in a context of global changes". The estimated quantities and economic values proposed 
are consumptive direct use values derived from studies and data from the forest and agricultural sectors, and obtained 
from a combination of multiple sources (Forest services, national statistics, surveys, etc.) dating from the years 1999-
2001.  They  are  based  on  several  valuation  methods  using  production  and  consumption  data,  market  prices,  fees, 
market prices of similar goods, opportunity cost of labour, substitute goods, etc. This is an interesting illustration of 
what can be achieved through the use economic valuation methods.

3.2.3.2  Ecological services  water, soil, health and security 

Mediterranean  forests  generate  of  wide  range  of  ecological  services  related  to  the  protection  and  maintenance  of 
water, soil and health. Forests regulate hydrological flows and water quality, intercept and store rainfall and moisture, 
and supply water (surface drainage and infiltration to groundwater), regulate river flow, hinder water and wind-induced 
erosion and therefore reduce soil loss and sedimentation (FAO, 2003; Farley et al., 2005; Albergel et al., 2011).  

As  Croitoru  and  Liagre  (2013)  pinpoint,  in  such  a  fragile  environment  as  the  Mediterranean,  the  role  of  forests  in 
protecting  water  supplies,  regulating  water  flows,  and  conserving  soil  is  particularly  important.  However,  assessing 
these benefits is difficult, primarily due to the unclear cause-and-effect relationships between forests and water, and 
the  complexity  of  water-related  functions.  On  a  short  term  basis,  and  especially  in  dry  areas  with  porous  geology, 
trees may to some extent decrease locally water availability, owed to the large quantities of water they consume.  

Nonetheless,  in  general,  forest  cover  is  beneficial  to  ground  and  surface  water.  Indeed,  compared  to  conventional 
agricultural land, forested catchments supply downstream populations with higher quality water. In countries such as 
Syria, watershed protection is the most valuable benefit of forests while in the Maghreb countries, it is only second in 
value after grazing (Croitoru and Liagre, 2013).  

The  forest  cover  and  root  systems  play  an  important  role  in  soil  retention  and  formation.  For  example,  the  roots 
stabilize  the  soil  and  make  it  less  susceptible  to  disintegration  preventing  losses  and  landslides.  They  also  exert  a 
mechanical  and  chemical  influence  on  the  ground  and  rocks,  contributing  to  soil  formation.  Moreover,  the  foliage, 
branches  and  litter  partly  intercept  rainfall  and  decrease  rain  drops  speed  and  impact  on  the  ground,  limiting 
compaction  and  soil  loss,  and  leaf  fall  and  decay  contribute  to  soil  organic  matter  enrichment  and  fertility 
enhancement. 

Recognizing the role forests play in soil and water protection, "protective forests" have been designated worldwide to 
prevent soil erosion and preserve water resources (FAO, 2010; Forest Europe, UNECE and FAO, 2011). According to 
official  data,  in  the  Mediterranean,  they  represent  about  80  million  ha,  but  their  cover  differs  markedly  between 
countries (see Figure 3.5).

Mediterranean forests also benefit human health and security, through a combination of processes and services: they 
attenuate floods, drought and  landslides, contribute to the remediation of waste and noxious compounds (e.g. they 
assimilate contaminants, filter airborne particles), supply pharmaceutical substances for medicinal use (their potential is 
currently untapped) and are for many of us an essential component of mental health and well-being. 

3.2.3.3  Biospheric services  climate regulation, biodiversity conservation 

Biospheric services  include the contribution of forests to the protection, preservation and creation of biodiversity at 
the  gene,  species,  community  and  ecosystem  levels,  as  well  as  their  role  in  climate  regulation  (i.e.  maintenance  of 
climate  and  weather  conditions  favourable  to  human  life)  and  in  gas  regulation  (i.e.  influence  on  the  chemical 
composition  of  the  atmosphere  and  oceans,  including  the  absorption  and  sequestration  of  CO2  and  related  global 
warming mitigation).  

The striking geographical and topographical variability, the pronounced climatic bi-seasonality are some of the reasons 
for the exceptional overall biodiversity value of Mediterranean forests, this biodiversity being an essential component 
of all other services. Indeed, they offer shelter to over 25 000 plant species, 60% of them endemic (c. 13,000 species) 
(Myers et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 2005; Cuttelod et al., 2009). Vertebrate density is also very high with about 200 
species of terrestrial mammals, of which 25% are endemic. A larger number of species, 350, can be counted for the 
avifaunal communities (Scarascia-Mugnozza et al., 2000). 

Mediterranean forests have nearly twice as many woody species as other European forests (247 as opposed to 135), 
158 species being exclusive or largely preferential, compared with 46 in central and northern European forests. Their 
conservation  is  thus  a  priority.  FAO  (2010)  estimated  to  1.7 million ha  (2%  of  the  total  forest  area)  the  area  of  so 
called  primary  forests,  i.e.  "forests  of  native  species  in  which  there  are  no  clearly  visible  indications  of  human  activity  and 
where ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed".  

As  an  illustration,  in  2010,  almost  8.5  million  ha  of  forests  in  the  Mediterranean  region  were  designated  for  the 
conservation of biodiversity (Figure 3.6), i.e. 10% of the total forest area, and during the last two decades (19902010), 
this area increased by 3% (FAO, 2010). Moreover, the area of forests within protected areas also increased, reaching 
18 million ha in 2010, with an annual increment of 3.2% between 1990 and 2010.

country, in 2010. Note: Countries with less than 100 000 ha are not shown (FAO, 2010)  

 

In terms of carbon absorption and sequestration, both in aboveground and belowground biomass, estimations indicate 
that Mediterranean forests are significant and valuable carbon sinks, sequestering overall between 0.01 and 1.08 t C 
ha1 annually (Croitoru and Merlo, 2005; Ding et al., 2011), i.e. between 0.8 and 90 million t C per year. In 2010, they 
were stocking almost 5 billion t of carbon, i.e. 1.6% of the global forest carbon  (FAO, 2010), France, Italy, Spain and 
Turkey storing around 65% of it, and this stock increased by 1.3% during the last two decades.  

 

19 

 

However,  the  sink/source  behaviour  of  forests  differs  across  the  Mediterranean  Region  influenced  by  natural 
conditions  (climate,  forest  growth,  fires,  etc.)  and  human  pressures  (deforestation,  abandonment,  overexploitation, 
etc.). In 2001, while forests from northern and western Europe were net sinks of carbon, forests from a few south and 
eastern countries (e.g. Morocco, Algeria, Lebanon) were net carbon sources, loosing between 0.1 and 0.5 t C/ha/yr, 
due to their slow growth and strong human and environmental pressures (UNECE & FAO, 2000). 

3.2.3.4  Social services  ecotourism, recreation, sports, hunting, etc.  

Social  services  refer  to  those  multiple  opportunities  that  forests  offer  for  ecotourism  (bird  watching,  fauna/flora 
observation, etc.), relaxation, recreation through the practice of sports (mountain biking, walking, horse riding, tree 
climbing, , etc.), fishing/hunting, etc. 

Recreation and landscape qualities of Mediterranean forests have always been valued, but demand for those services 
has  been  raising  significantly,  due  to  income  growth,  urbanization  of  the  population,  better  and  cheaper  transport 
means, etc. The Mediterranean basin, and especially its coastal areas, is one of the world's leading tourist destinations, 
and tourism is an essential driver of the socio-economic activity and a major source of income and employment. For 
example, in 2007, the Mediterranean countries received 275 million international tourists, which is about 30% of the 
global  aggregate.  And  by  2025,  inflows  are  likely  to  reach  637  million  tourists,  of  which  312  million  in  the  coastal 
regions alone (Plan Bleu, 2013). Mediterranean tourism is dominated by France, Spain and Italy which received in 2010 
c. 60% of all inbound tourists (26%, 18% and 15% respectively) and 70% of their spending. The six Spanish natural parks 
located in the Mediterranean area received 1.6 million visitors in 2008, and visits increased by 40% during the last ten 
years  (Mavsar  and  Varela,  2010).  Tourism  spending  comprises  1.52%  of  the  GDP  in  the  Mediterranean  region, 
although there are major national and local disparities. In 2010, for example, foreign tourist spending accounted for 
13 % of GDP in Lebanon and 0.7 % in Turkey.  

Hunting is another important forest related activity in many Mediterranean countries (sometimes a welcome source of 
livelihood  in  the  South,  and  more  of  a  recreational  activity  in  the  North).  Regional  or  local  administrations  sell 
shooting/hunting permits and reinvest part of the incomes into forest management. Poaching is a preoccupying issue in 
some countries (e.g. Morocco, Lebanon) threatening to degrade game populations. 

3.2.3.5  Amenity services - spiritual, cultural, historical 

Mediterranean forests offer a multitude of amenity services that cover a broad range of social, spiritual, cultural and 
historical  services,  related  to  the  complexity,  structure,  aesthetic  and  beauty  of  forests,  landscapes  and  their 
components  (fauna  and  flora)  and  their  use  for  relaxation,  education,  reflection,  religious/spiritual  rituals  and 
gatherings, historical events, national symbols (e.g. the Lebanese cedar), folklore, myths, etc. They are very valuable 
components of the national cultural heritage that have been modelled for centuries and passed on from generation to 
generation.  They  inspire  undeniably  artistic  creativity  (painting,  drawing,  etc.)  and  are  valuable  environmental 
educational  playgrounds  for  school  pupils  and  students  to  interact  with  their  environment  and  study  ecosystems 
processes.  Those  values  are  particularly  strong  in  remnant  ancient  forests,  which  host  a  wealth  of  biodiversity  in 
addition to information, know-how, for example regarding management and conservation activities and strategies to 
enhance resilience and adaptation to threats such as climate change or forest fires (Mansourian and al., 2013). 

The way humans perceive forests, the benefits they expect from them, and the goods and services they really extract, 
are  linked  to  people's  values,  needs  and  perception,  and  shaped  by  the  socioeconomic  and  political  context,  the 
organization  of  the  society,  the  living  standards  and  availability  of  consumption  alternatives.  In  the  Mediterranean, 
overall, the improvement in living conditions and welfare has made more relevant and valuable the social and amenity 
services that forests provide. 

3.2.4  Beneficiaries  of  forest  goods  and  services  and  differences  across  the 

Mediterranean basin 

Forests goods and services benefit multiple users, both directly and indirectly, and not only those users that live or act 
within  or  in  the  vicinity  of  forests.  Local  communities  and  rural  populations,  industrial  loggers,  but  also  urban 
populations,  the  agricultural  sector  and  the  industry  all  obtain  to  some  extent  benefits  from  forests.  Therefore, 
benefits  are  indeed  spreading  at  the  catchment  area  scale,  but  also  at  the  regional  and  national  scale,  although  the 

 

20 

 

complete scope of forest beneficiaries is rarely fully acknowledged. Nevertheless, identifying those beneficiaries is a key 
to  hindering  the  loss  of  forest  goods  and  services  and  developing  relevant  mechanisms  to  finance  the  sustainable 
production  in  public  as  well  as  private  areas  (e.g.  user  permits,  tax  incentives,  direct  funding,  cap  and  trade, 
certification schemes, partial redistribution of the economic benefits, biodiversity offsets, etc.). 

The state of forests in the Mediterranean region can be  better understood if seen in light of differences existing in 
socio-economic  development  and  in  the  balance  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  The  distinction  between  southern 
Europe,  northern  Africa  and  the  near-east  may  pave  the  way  for  learning  from  the  failed  experiences  of  southern 
European countries. 

In  the  north  of  the  Mediterranean  region,  the  rural  exodus  that  has  taken  place  since  the  late  1960s  resulted  in 
abandoned agricultural lands becoming progressively covered by a woody vegetation of shrubs and young trees that 
eventually will give rise to natural reforestation as a result of secondary succession. This process is also favoured by 
the reduction of animal grazing in the forest that previously inhibited the growth of the understory. Forest products 
such  as  timber  and  fuel  wood,  but  also  no  longer  profitable  forage,  gum  and  turpentine,  have  lost  some  of  their 
importance  and  marketability.  By  contrast,  the  ecological,  recreational  and  landscape  functions  of  the  forest  have 
increased  their  relevance  which  influences  political  decisions  towards  the  development  of  adequate  mechanisms  to 
preserve forests and manage them accordingly.  

However, because they provide no revenues to their private or communal owners, this results in an even diminished 
interest  of  the forest  owners  in  cultivating  and  maintaining  their  forests  and  increases  the  risk  for  natural  disasters 
such as soil erosion, landslides and forest fires. The type of forest ownership has important implications on the use and 
conservation of these forests. In southern Europe, forests are mainly privately owned with very fragmented properties. 
The lack of profitability (elevated labour cost, difficult access, etc.) and incentives (lack of market and added value for 
the products harvested) and the difficulties in reaching agreements among the several forest owners, jeopardizes the 
setup  of  shared  management  plans  for  the  enhancement  of  these  forests.  This  also  results  in  negative  externalities, 
including increased fire risk and damages, loss of landscape quality, more intense use of non-renewable materials, etc. 
In those regions, the demand from the society for non-use benefits is much higher. 

In contrast with the previous, the SEMC face a very different situation. When it comes to ownership, forests largely 
belong to the state (Scarascia-Mugnozza et al., 2000). In general, local communities are allowed to exploit them, under 
certain  regulations  (for  grazing,  firewood,  fodder  collection,  etc.).  However,  the  level  of  rural  poverty  and  strong 
dependence of populations on forest services for subsistence and income generation exert strong pressures on forest 
ecosystems,  resulting  in  overgrazing,  over-extraction  of  timber  and  non-wood  forest  products,  and  conversion  of 
forest land for agricultural use (Merlo and Croitoru, 2005), with subsequent dramatic consequences such as erosion, 
CO2 emissions, loss of biodiversity, etc.  

Some of the problems faced by forests in SEMC are related to overuse, overgrazing and competition from other land 
uses.  These  threats  hamper  productivity  and  reduce  the  provision  of  environmental  services  (Croitoru  and  Liagre, 
2013).  In  many  countries,  forest  degradation  is  likely  to  be  a  more  relevant  issue  than  deforestation  itself  (CIFOR, 
2009). However, it should be reminded that although net deforestation at global level seems to have slowed down, this 
is  only  a  result  of  the  increasing  area  under  plantations  (FAO,  2010b).  Croitoru  and  Liagre  (2013)  collected  some 
experiences that account for the cost of deforestation and forest degradation in terms of the countries GDP, such as 
0.2% of the GDP in Morocco (Ellatifi, 2005) or 0.7% of the GDP in Iran (Croitoru and Sarraf, 2010). 

3.2.5  Drivers  of  change  in  Mediterranean  forests  and  their  repercussions  on  the 

goods and services these ecosystems provide 

Despite their apparent fragility, Mediterranean forest landscapes have been shaped by human activities for centuries 
and have demonstrated their strong resilience to anthropogenic changes and natural catastrophes. Forest ecosystems 
are continuously shaped by multiple drivers of change (direct or indirect), the predominant ones being deforestation, 
overgrazing,  climate  change,  mismanagement  or  abandonment,  fires.  Exposed  to  these  pressures,  they  undergo 
important changes, which in turn have significant repercussions on the provided goods and services and ultimately on 
the well-being of the society, at local, regional and global scale, and in the short and long term (Figure 3.7).

As stressed before, the situations in the Mediterranean region are quite contrasting: indeed, in SEMC, forests suffer 
relatively  heavy  anthropogenic  pressures,  while  in  northern  countries  they  are  rather  subject  to  low  intensity 
management or even abandonment. 
 
3.2.5.1  Impact of climate change on forest goods and services and mitigation opportunities 

Drastic changes are expected to take place in the Mediterranean Region, as a result of climate change manifestations, 
i.e.  a  decrease  in  precipitation  quantity  and  shift  in  its  seasonal  distribution,  more  frequent  extreme  events, 
temperature  rise,  repeated  droughts,  higher  evapotranspiration,  water  stress  and  vegetation  dieback  and  mortality, 
more frequent and intense wildfires, insects and diseases outbreaks and spread of invasive exotic species, etc. Overall, 
climate  change  is  likely  to  reduce  the  ability  of  Mediterranean  forests  to  autonomously  accommodate  to  increased 
perturbations such as increased frequency and risk of pathogens outbreaks, uncontrolled fires, and other large-scale 
disturbances (FAO/Silva Mediteranea, 2010). 

The Mediterranean area represents a transition zone between arid and humid regions of the world with a large part of 
its forests at the limit of their bio-geographical distribution. Hence, it is one of the most sensible and vulnerable area 
to climate change and it is expected that changes will likely become more intense and rapid (IPCC, 2007a, b; Regato, 
2008; FAO, 2011; Vayreda et al., 2012). 

Climate change is already altering significantly forests growth, dynamics and functions, as well as genetic resources and 
overall biodiversity, and will have a striking influence on the provision of forest ecosystems goods and services such as 
the regulation of the water cycle, the storage and emission of carbon (and source or sink behaviour of woodlands), 
and delivery of wood and non-wood products and services in the medium and long term (MEA, 2005; Martinez-Vilalta 
et al., 2008; Palahi et al., 2008; FAO, 2013). Dryer and warmer conditions and reduced water availability are expected 

 

22 

 

to  favour  the  expansion  of  semi-arid  and  arid  systems,  and  are  likely  to  induce  substantial  species-range  shifts  and 
isolation of populations (IPCC, 2007a, b; Loarie et al., 2009; FAO, 2010). 

Nonetheless, the sensitivity and therefore the response of forests to climate change depend on multiple interrelated 
factors, such as forest type, age, structure and location, tree and plant species considered (diversity and interactions), 
environmental factors (water, temperature, nutrients, light, etc.), exposure to pests, diseases and fires, management 
(e.g. thinning practices), etc.  

In fact, climate change might influence forest expansion positively or negatively, by enhancing or inhibiting tree growth 
and carbon storage in aboveground and belowground compartments: CO2 enrichment might stimulate tree growth, 
while a rise in temperature and more severe and repeated droughts might cause higher soil carbon losses and tree 
mortality and dieback. In 2003, for example, Europe experienced an exceptionally dry and hot summer in the western 
and central regions which triggered a considerable increase in carbon fluxes from the land to the atmosphere (Jones 
and Cox, 2005).  

In  Mediterranean  Europe,  most  forests  consist  of  sclerophyllous  and  some  deciduous  species  that  are  rather  well 
adapted to summer soil water deficits. Therefore, the on-going temperature rise could favour the expansion of some 
thermophilous tree species (e.g. Quercus pyrenaica) if water availability is not excessively limiting (IPCC, 2001). 

Climate  change  is  also  expected  to  favour  insect  and  disease  outbreaks  as  well  as  tree  dieback,  which  could  have 
significant  effects  on  tree  mortality,  diversity  and  subsequently  on  forest  services.  The  Pine  processionary 
(Thaumetopoea pityocampa), which  attacks  several  species (Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster, P. nigra, P. sylvestris, Cedrus sp., 
etc.) is  already  an  important  economic  pest  in  several  Mediterranean  countries  (Spain,  France,  etc.)  and  its  impacts 
could get worse. 

Box 3.1: Forest and carbon 

Regarding  the  opportunities  for  the  attenuation  and  mitigation  of  climate  change  and  deforestation,  a  few  financing 
initiatives exist and might be underexploited currently. For example, several flexible project-based mechanisms are being 
implemented to incentivise greenhouse gas emission reductions or carbon sequestration under the Kyoto Protocol, e.g. joint 
implementation (JI) and clean development mechanism (CDM) (UNFCCC, 2013), the European Union emissions trading 
Scheme (EU ETS) (EU Commission, 2013) or the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation scheme 
(REDD/REDD+) (UN-REDD, 2013). The prospects for the market in carbon emission reductions are promising and the 
global  carbon  markets  are  expanding  rapidly,  but  many  challenges  remain,  regarding  financing,  monitoring,  double-
counting of credits, etc.  

However, only a small share of the markets is represented by emission reduction from carbon sequestration and forest 
carbon is not usually enough considered in the current schemes. Voluntary markets and public payments seem to be more 
likely to be interesting for the forest sector, since buyers are keener on using carbon payments to restore degraded lands 
and  encourage  agro-forestry  on  a  large  scale.  Payments  contemplated  in  the  framework  of  REDD+,  for  avoided 
deforestation and forest degradation, carbon stocks enhancement and sustainable management, are of growing interest 
and could play a significant role in the preservation and expansion of forests.  

3.2.5.2  Impact of forest fires on forest goods and services  

Evolutionary  and  paleobotanical  studies  suggest  that  fires  are  a  natural  phenomenon  in  the  Mediterranean  basin. 
However, some studies suggest that current fire regimes are human induced and surpass by far the natural regimes. 
Fire  may  cause  disasters  in  the  sense  of  inducing  abrupt  community  changes  or  important  soil  losses  (Pausas et al., 
2008).  

Furthermore, wildfires introduce a high risk of direct damage to humans and structures in most of the highly populated 
Mediterranean countries, and especially in coastal regions. Their impact is largely influenced by weather conditions (e.g. 
high temperatures, low moisture and strong winds) but also by forest type, structure and management, fuel availability 
and characteristics, and the intervention/response of fire fighting means. 

 

23 

 

Climate change scenarios foresee an increase in the intensity and frequency of high intensity fires in 
the  near  future  (Flannigan,  2000;  IPCC,  2007a,  b),  which  will  trigger  higher  carbon  losses  and  will 
severely  diminish  the  capacity  of  recovery  of  the  vegetation  in  burnt  areas,  due  to  both  higher  fire 
recurrence and progressive soil degradation and loss.  

Therefore,  in  order  to  limit  the  negative  impacts  of  fires  on  forest  services,  it  appears  essential  to 
actively  manage  forests  in  an  integrated  manner,  to  promote  the  creation  of  stands  and  landscapes 
more  resilient  to  forest  fires.  It  involves  thinning  practices  to  reduce  tree  density  or  creation  of 
discontinuities in the landscapes to slow down fires progression and attenuate their intensity.  

However,  removing  fire  completely  from  the  ecosystem  is  an  impossible  and  non-desirable  aim. 
Instead, an integrated fire management approach should be adopted (Rego and al., 2010). This concept 
embraces  planning  and  operational  systems  that  include  social,  economic,  cultural  and  ecological 
evaluations  with  the  objective  of  minimizing  the  damage  and  maximizing  the  benefits  of  fire.  These 
systems include a combination of prevention and suppression strategies and techniques that integrate 
the use of technical fires and regulate traditional burning, e.g. through the use of prescribed fires to 
control fuel availability and reduce the risk of megafires (Kashian, 2006; Rego and al., 2010; Silva and 
al., 2010; Vericat and al., 2012).  

3.2.5.3  Impact of pests and diseases on forest goods and services 

Mediterranean forests are adversely affected by pests, diseases and woody invasive species (table 3.2), as well as by 
wildlife browsing, parasitic plants (e.g. Loranthus europaeus and Viscum album), and several abiotic disturbances (e.g. air 
pollution,  storms,  droughts),  which  have  significant  economic  repercussions.  Their  recurrence  and  impacts  are 
expected to worsen with climate change and introduction of alien species and strains.

3.2.5.4  Impact of socio-economic changes on forest goods and services 

3.2.5.4.1  General demographic trends in the Mediterranean 

Demographic  trends  and  scenarios,  influenced  by  the  national  and  local  macro-economic  and  political  contexts,  are 
markedly  different  across  the  Mediterranean  region  (Groenewold et al.,  2012),  and  thus,  the  resulting  pressures  on 
ecosystems and resources are also variable. 
 
The total population of the Mediterranean region doubled between 1955 and 2010, rising from about 220 million to 
500 million  inhabitants.  Southern  and  eastern  countries  accounted  for  just  over  one-third  of  the  population  of  the 
region in 1955, but for more than half of it in 2010 (UN-DESA-PD, 2011). In addition, the total population is projected 
to keep on increasing during a few decades, at least until 2050, when it may reach over 620 million inhabitants. It is 
then projected to start declining by 2030 in northern countries and by 2060 in the southern and eastern countries 
(Figure 3.8).

Population  growth  rates  vary  between  northern  and  southern/eastern  Mediterranean  countries  but  seem  to  be 
converging. Southern and eastern countries are indeed characterized by younger populations, higher birth rates and an 
annual population growth rate around 2-3%, currently slowing down, due to fertility decline. Western and northern 
European countries, on the contrary, are characterized by an ageing population and a slight population decline, which 
could cause labour shortage in the future. The share of urban population increases in all countries. However, rural 
population  diminishes  in  northern,  but  still  grows  in  southern  countries,  where  it  should  start  decreasing  by  2020 
(Figure 3.9).

Department of Economic and Social Affairs - Population Division, 2011).  

3.2.5.4.2  Rising ecological footprint and changing demand 

The ecological footprint of consumption (EF) (human demand, expressed in global hectares (gha) per capita) (Ewing et al., 
2010)  in  the  Mediterranean  region  has  increased  by  52%  between  1961  and  2008  (from  2.1  to  3.1  gha  per  capita; 
mostly due to the increase in the carbon component). Simultaneously, the per capita biocapacity (Earth's supply, i.e. the 
capacity of biologically productive land and sea areas to produce materials and services useful for humans, expressed in 
gha), decreased by 16% (from 1.5 to 1.3 gha). The ecological deficit, i.e. the difference between the biocapacity and the 
EF  of  consumption  of  a  region  or  country,  greater  in  northern  countries,  rose  by  230%.  This  unsustainable  trend 
continues, and the EF of all Mediterranean countries surpasses their biocapacity, and is now above the global average 
biocapacity (1.8 gha/capita) (GFN, 2012).  

The rising demographic pressure, growing food, water and energy consumption, waste production and pollution, as 
well as changes in production objectives and strategies, stimulate the conversion and fragmentation of forest land for 
other  uses  (e.g.  urbanization,  agricultural  production,  commercial  plantations  or  biofuel  generation)  with  the 

 

26 

 

consequent drastic loss of ecosystem goods and services. For example, clearing and farming on marginal land, overuse 
of  fuel-wood,  overgrazing,  increased  water  use  or  soil  degradation  are  some  of  the  many  pressures  threatening 
ecosystem goods and services.  

In 2007, the Mediterranean accounted for 8% of the world's energy consumption, and consumption per capita was 13% 
higher than the world's average, the Region emitting 8% of global CO2 emissions in 2006 (Plan Bleu, 2009). In 2009, the 
regional installed capacity stood at 496 GW, of which 33% from natural gas, 18% hydro power, 14% nuclear, 13% coal, 
12%  oil  and  10%  non-hydro  renewable  sources  (Observatoire  Mediterraneen  de  l'Energie,  2011).  Improvement  in 
technologies  and  the  development  and  spread  of  renewable  energies  in  rural  contexts  could  decrease  further  the 
demand for fuel wood and thus alleviate the pressure on forests. 

Urban  populations  occupy  a  growing  share  of  the  overall  population,  as  does  their  EF,  and  this  shift  from  rural  to 
urban  civilizations  has  profound  implications  on  the  relationship  between  humans  and  their  environment,  and 
especially, on value and treat natural resources.  

The overall improvement of living standards across the Mediterranean, as illustrated by the progressive increment in 
the human development index (HDI) (UNDP, 2011), will result in more financial resources and leisure time for these 
populations and could trigger a growing demand for amenities and social services (ecotourism, sport, relaxation, etc.), 
which underlines the importance of the non-market dimension of forests, and could boost the valorisation of those 
ecosystems, promoting their conservation. Therefore, the increasing demand for forest goods and services can also be 
seen as an opportunity to stronger promote the sustainable manage those ecosystems.  

3.2.5.4.3  Rising pressure on water resources 

The pressure on water resources is also growing in Mediterranean countries, due to the rising population and use for 
tourism  and  agriculture,  and  this  trend  is  exacerbated  by climate  change.  Water  per  capita  availability  in  south  and 
eastern countries is already very limited and decreasing steadily. In all those countries except Turkey (with a water 
availability around 3500 m3/inhabitant/yr), water availability is below 1000 m3 water per capita per year (the threshold 
characterizing  water-poor  countries),  and  even  below  500  m3  for  six  countries  (Malta,  Jordan,  West  bank,  Israel, 
Algeria, Tunisia), and below 94 m3 in Libya. Under climate change conditions, all SEMCs are projected to experience 
severe water stress (Plan Bleu, 2006, 2011, 2013; Blinda, 2012; FAO, 2013). 

There  is  no  doubt  that  forests  have  overall  positive  effects  on  the  water  cycle  and  soil  conservation,  by  limiting 
evaporation from the soil, increasing infiltration and recharge of aquifers, slowing down the water flow, and hindering 
soil erosion. They also benefit greatly water quality, since they are usually less exposed to pesticides and fertilizers, and 
also retain and transform pollutants.  

However, forested areas usually exhibit greater interception, evapotranspiration and infiltration rates than urban and 
agricultural  land,  resulting  in  smaller  amounts  of  surface  water  directly  usable  for  human  consumption  down  the 
catchment.  This  impact  is  not  precisely  known  and  often  debated,  due  to  the  difficulties  in  assessing  accurately  the 
water balances of forested catchments.  

Forests  therefore  compete  to  some  extent  with  humans  for  water,  more  or  less  depending  on  the  tree  species 
composing  them.  Acacia,  for  example,  where  they  became  invasive,  may  decrease  significantly  water  supplies  for 
nearby communities, due to their high water demand. On the contrary, Pinus pinea (Stone Pine) or Quercus spp. are 
less water demanding and able to grow in dryer environments, which has a positive impact on watersheds and soils, 
and affects to a lesser degree human water consumption. Important trade-offs are subsequently involved in terms of 
goods and services provision, and they have to be carefully accounted for in territorial planning, resource management 
and to guide site-specific sylvicultural activities. 

Recognizing and capturing collectively the multiple values of Mediterranean forests, the potential trade-offs between 
the  goods  and  services  they  provide,  and  their  importance  in  sustaining  rural  and  urban  populations  is  essential  to 
protect them and manage them adequately and sustainably.

4. Evaluation methods  

The overall objective of this chapter is to provide a summarised overview of the two main decision support methods, which 
can be used for the evaluation of forest management alternatives. The cost benefit analysis (CBA) compares the positive 
and negative impacts of the implementation of a management alternative in monetary terms. The multi-criteria analysis 
(MCA) compares the performance of management alternatives according to a set of selected evaluation criteria. 

Environmental  decisions  are  often  complex,  multifaceted  and  involve  many  different  stakeholders  with  different 
priorities or objectives. The selection of appropriate management approaches or regulatory processes often involves 
multiple criteria such as the distribution of costs and benefits, environmental impacts for different populations, safety, 
ecological  risk,  or  human  values  (Kiker  and  al.,  2005).  To  make  adequate  decisions  the  situation,  preferences  of 
stakeholders and the consequences of the available alternatives have to be well understood (Gregory and al., 2012).  

However, research on human judgements and decision making shows that the simplifications which are made to enable 
to  facilitate  to  deal  with  complex  problems  sometimes  do  not  work  well.  People  are  inclined  to  be  biased  in  their 
assessments of alternatives that can more readily be linked to what is familiar (representativeness heuristic), and to be 
unduly influenced by recent, memorable, or successful experience (availability heuristic) (Dodgson and al. 2001). 

Thus, to facilitate the decision making process different methods can be applied to evaluate the outcomes, strengths 
and weaknesses of alternative management approaches. The most commonly used decision support tools to evaluate 
alternatives for achieving a certain objective are the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), multi-
criteria analysis (MCA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) (Ozdemiroglu and al, 2006).  
 
In  this  report  evaluation  methods  (chapter  4)  and  valuation  methods  (chapter  5)  are  distinguished.  Evaluation  is 
considered as the process of determining the performance of an alternative in regard to the objectives, and results of 
any such action that has been completed; while valuation is the process of estimating what something is worth. 

CBA is a decision support method which aims to compare all relevant benefits and costs (in monetary terms) of an 
alternative (project, policy or programme), including impacts on environmental goods and services. It can be applied 
before (ex-ante) and after (ex-post) an action is taken. Its application to any natural environment category is limited by 
the availability of the necessary data on economic value of the affected environmental good or service.  

CEA  is  a  decision  support  method  which  relates  the  costs  of  alternative  ways  of  producing  the  same  or  similar 
outcomes to a measure of those resulting outcomes. Notably CEA is equivalent to one dimension of CBA in that it 
can answer the question of the most efficient way of achieving a given objective. However, CEA do not consider the 
benefits that different alternatives can provide. CEA may be employed both ex-ante and ex-post evaluation, and can 
potentially incorporate both economic and deliberative and participatory measures of value for quantifying both costs 
and  effectiveness.  Where  effectiveness  is  expressed  in  a  mixture  of  monetary  and  other  units,  comparisons  can  be 
made if scoring and weighting are applied which could be gathered through deliberative and participatory approaches. 
CEA may also form part of a ranking exercise in MCA.  

MCA is a term covering a variety of methods which involve: (i) developing a set of criteria for comparing options; (ii) 
evaluating the performance of each of the options against each criterion; (iii) weighting each criterion according to its 
relative importance; and (iv) aggregating across options to produce an overall assessment. Most methods involve some 
form of averaging weights or evaluations across individuals and use deliberative and participatory approaches, though 
monetary expressions from economic valuation methods can also be used within an MCA. Some extensions (multi-
criteria mapping, stakeholder decision analysis, most recently deliberative mapping) incorporate MCA within a wider 
deliberative process, aiming to overcome some of the shortcomings of MCA by harnessing its strengths to enhance 
stakeholder discussions.  

LCA is an analytical method that assesses the impacts to the environment, natural resources and human health (e.g., 
quantity  of  resources  extracted  and  emissions)  associated  with  all  life  stages  of  a  products  (i.e.,  from  raw  material 

28 

 

 

extraction  through  materials  processing,  manufacture,  distribution,  use,  repair  and  maintenance,  and  disposal  or 
recycling)  (Wrisberg  and  al.,  1997).  The  intention  of  LCA  is  to  provide  a  numerical  basis  for  comparison  between 
alternative methods of achieving a specific function or service. In general LCA is a site and time-independent tool with 
no consideration given to when and where emissions take place. However more recent applications seek to introduce 
site dependent factors that reflect types of environments and output situations (e.g., Finnveden and Nilsson, 2005). 

In continuation MCA and CBA are presented, which are the most commonly applied decision support methods for the 
evaluation  of  forest  and  environmental  management  projects  (Myllyviita  and  al.  2011).  In  addition,  considering  the 
context, the limited resources and time of the project, they are considered as the most suitable.  

4.1  Multi-criteria analysis 

Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is a decision support method that can be used to evaluate different alternatives. These 
alternatives may be very broad (e.g. different policy options) or concrete cases of applied instruments. Applying MCA 
helps  to  compare  alternatives  according  to  their  performance  with  regard  to  a  selected  set  of  evaluation  criteria. 
These  performances  are  presented  in  a  so  called  performance  matrix,  or  consequence  table.  In  this  matrix  each 
column  represents  an  alternative  (case)  and  each  row  describes  the  performance  of  the  alternative  against  each 
criterion (see Box 4.1 p 33). In a basic form of MCA this performance matrix may be the final product and each user 
can  use  this  matrix  to  make his  own  judgement  (for details  see:  DTLR  multi-criteria  analysis  manual1 or  EuropeAid 
multi-criteria analysis guidelines2). 

MCA is the method of choice in forest resource planning when: 
  There is a need to structure a complex decision problem; 
  The problems are multi-objective or have multiple criteria to be considered; 
  There are heterogeneous sets of criteria involved;  
  There are conflicting objectives involved; 
  Different management alternatives are to be compared; 
  There is need for a more rational, transparent, and comprehensive analysis (e.g., in public participation); 
  There are qualitative and quantitative data at different scales included in the decision model. 

More  sophisticated  MCA  techniques  convert  the  information  given  by  the  performance  matrix  into  consistent 
numerical  values.  Usually  this  conversion  is  done  by  the  process  of  scoring  and  weighting,  and  the  application  of 
mathematical routines where the estimated scores and weights are combined into overall scores for each alternative.  

4.1.1  Step of a multi-criteria analysis 

The main steps of a MCA are the following: 

Step 1: Establish the aims of the MCA, the decision makers and other stakeholders 
Before starting the MCA, it is crucial to clearly define the objective of the MCA (why it is done) and to define who 
should be involved in the MCA process (e.g. decision makers and other stakeholders). 

Step 2:  Identify alternatives 
After the objectives and the stakeholders are identified, the alternatives (e.g. alternative management approaches) to 
be evaluated should be listed.

29 

 

Step 3:  Define the criteria (and the corresponding objectives) that reflect the relevant consequences of 
each option  
In  this  step  the  evaluation  criteria  are  defined.  The  criteria  are  measures  of  performance  applied  to  evaluate  the 
alternatives.  To  evaluate  forest  management  regimes  and  alternatives  in  regards  to  their  specific  benefits  and  to 
sustainability in general has led to the use of criteria and indicators (C&I) (Prabhu and al., 1996; Van Bueren and Blom, 
1997). 

According to Prabhu and al. (1999), a criterion is a principle or standard that an issue is judged by, and an indicator is 
defined as any variable or component of the forest ecosystem used to infer the status of a particular criterion. C&I 
approaches  appear  to  be  highly  capable  of  measuring  aspects  of  sustainable  forest  management  (SFM)  at  regional, 
national and forest management unit levels. An additional strength of a C&I approach is that it can be used to collect 
and report information within a system (e.g., SFM), which is usually characterized by a lack of knowledge, uncertainties, 
and missing information about impacts, dependencies, and feedbacks (Rametsteiner, 2001; Brang  and al.,  2002). The 
power of C&I is limited when (i) there are unclear definitions involved, (ii) there is lack of reliability, (iii) there are no 
target or threshold values provided, or (iv) a C&I system too strongly simplifies a complex item (Brang and al., 2002).  

For example, the ForestEurope process (Forest Europe, 2013) developed a set of C&I for SFM, which can be used to 
facilitate the evaluation of progress towards it, both at regional and national level. These C&I are:  
 

  Maintenance and appropriate enhancement of forest resources and their contribution to global carbon cycles; 
  Maintenance of health and vitality of forest ecosystems; 
  Maintenance and encouragement of productive functions of forests (wood and non-wood); 
  Maintenance, conservation and appropriate enhancement of biological diversity in forest ecosystems; 
  Maintenance,  conservation  and  appropriate  enhancement  of  protective  functions  in  forest  management 

(notably soil and water);  

  Maintenance of other socio-economic functions and conditions. 

However, the choice of an alternative can be made also against other criteria, which are not directly related to SFM, 
like: 

Effectiveness  refers  to  the  success  of  a  management  alternative  in  achieving  certain  objectives  (i.e. 
improved provision of non-market forest service). The effectiveness of a management alternative must 
be judged against these predefined objectives.  

Economic efficiency. Ideally, a management alternative should be designed so as to be able to achieve 
the  optimal  allocation  of  resources,  which  in  practice  often  means  the  ability  to  achieve  a  chosen 
objective at the lowest cost. Attention should be paid both to the direct costs (e.g. management costs) 
and the indirect cost in terms of opportunities forgone.  

Implementation complexity refers to the ease of designing and implementing the management, and 
it can be broken into two components:  
o 

Information  intensity represents how much information (e.g. data, predictive modelling skills) is 
necessary to design a management alternative.  

o  Administrative feasibility refers to the ease and cost of monitoring and enforcement.  
Implementation  complexity  is  closely  related  to  the  criterion  on  economic  efficiency,  because  a  high 
administrative cost increases the total cost associated with the management approach.  

Flexibility refers to the easiness to adapt to external changes in markets, technology, knowledge, and 
social, political and environmental conditions.  

Political  considerations  affect  the  choice  of  management  alternative  at  least  as  much  as  any  other 
arguments about their relative merits on the abovementioned dimensions. This criterion encompasses 
several dimensions, such as: 

30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Acceptability. It is important for the target groups to accept the management alternative imposed 

onto them; otherwise the planned outcome of management is in danger.  

o  Equity.  Different  management  alternatives  have  different  distributive  consequences  for  different 
interest  groups,  both  within  and  across  generation.  For  example,  in  situations  where  common 
property or open-access resources become less accessible, attention should be paid to those whose 
traditional  rights  will  be  affected.  Equity  requires  that  cost  burden  imposed  by  a  management 
approach is carefully considered, both for the actors directly affected (e.g., forest owner) and for 
the remaining interested parties (e.g. local population, etc.).  

o  Concordance with institutional frameworks requires that the management is concordant with 

the main policy principles, such as regional forest management plan and forest policy.  

Defining the criteria is a crucial part of the MCA. The selected criteria should reflect all the important characteristics 
of the evaluated alternatives (e.g. which characteristics would distinguish a good alternative from a bad one) and they 
have to be operational (e.g. is it possible to judge, in practice, how well an option performs on the selected criteria). 
The  criteria  should  also  facilitate  the  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  alternatives  (e.g.  the  efforts  needed  to 
implement and operate the management approach in a specific region). When selecting the criteria a balance must be 
found between the completeness of the applied criteria (considering all the important evaluation aspects) and keeping 
the evaluation task manageable and transparent (the complexity of the evaluation increases with the number of applied 
criteria). Thus not all the criteria presented in the above list have to be applied. 

Once the criteria are selected and tested for completeness, redundancy, operationally, independence, double counting, 
number, etc., they can be grouped. The main reasons for grouping criteria are: (a) to facilitate the checking whether 
the selected set of criteria is appropriate, with regard to the evaluation objective; (b) to ease the process of calculating 
criteria weights in large applications, where it can be helpful to assess weights within groups of related criteria, but also 
between groups of criteria.  

Step 4:  Describe  the  performance  of  each  alternative  against  the  criteria  in  the  performance  matrix 
and determine the score matrix (scoring)  
The next step is to identify how the alternatives perform with regard to the established criteria. This process is also 
known as scoring. However, before the scoring can be performed, all evaluated alternatives should be described, with 
regards to the selected criteria. These descriptions should be done in a neutral and objective way, not to influence the 
evaluation process.  

Once this description is available, in the next sequence, the score for the performance of each of the alternatives is 
ascribed. Scoring is the process of judging the performance of an alternative with regards to the defined criteria. The 
scoring  is  done  on  a  selected  interval  scale,  for  example  from  0  to  100,  where  0  represents  the  lowest  level  of 
performance, and 100 the highest. However, very often also simpler and more robust scales are applied.  

In  principle,  the  scoring  reflects  the  subjective  judgment  of  each  user  (or  group  of  users)  of  the  MCA.  Thus,  it  is 
recommendable that the MCA includes several users, representing different stakeholder groups, where in the analysis 
scores from several users (stakeholders) can be combined or compared, in order to obtain more robust results. 

Step 5:  Assign weights to each of the criteria to reflect their relative importance (weighting).  
The next step of the evaluation process is the weighting of the criteria. This step introduces the relative importance of 
the criteria, and thus adds another dimension to the evaluation process.  

The users involved in a MCA may not only differ in their judgement of the performance on criteria, but also in the 
relative importance they attach to different criteria. Therefore, weights are attached to each criterion. Since the score 
of an alternative (e.g. a management approach) is calculated as the weighted average of its criteria scores (see next 
step),  the  weights  are  crucial  in  the  aggregation  of  scores  (i.e.  to  assess  the  performance  of  a  single  management 
alternative as a whole).  

 

31 

 

Step 6:  Combine the weights and scores for each of the options to derive overall values.  
This step involves the calculation procedure, where the performance scores for each criterion are combined with the 
respective importance weights. The general equation is: 

(cid:1845)(cid:3036)(cid:3404)(cid:1875)(cid:2869)(cid:1871)(cid:3036)(cid:2869)(cid:3397)(cid:1875)(cid:2870)(cid:1871)(cid:3036)(cid:2870)(cid:3397)(cid:3397)(cid:1875)(cid:3041)(cid:1871)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3404)(cid:3533)(cid:1875)(cid:3037)(cid:1871)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)
(cid:3041)
(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)

 

where sij is the performance score for alternative i on criterion j, wj is the weight for criterion j and Si is the overall 
score for alternative i. 

The example in Box 4.1 illustrates how the weights of the criteria are transformed into relative weights, which sum up 
to 1. Therefore the user can apply any set of indicators/numbers that represents the relative importance he attaches 
to the criteria.  

Box 4.1: Example of calculation of a total score for a financing mechanism 
Here,  for  the  evaluation  of  alternative  management  approach  three  evaluation  criteria  are  used.  The  performance  of  each 
criterion can be scored with -1, 0 and +1, while the weights ascribed to the criterion can range between 0 and 2. Further the 
example assumes that three users were performing the scoring, ascribing the following scores and weights: 

Person 2

Total score 
To calculate the total score per user, the procedure is to multiply the score of a criterion by the weight of that criterion. Then the 
products for all criteria are summed and divided by the sum of the weights to obtain the total score for that criterion.  
For person 1 all criteria are equally important, so all weights are equal to 1 and so the score of the criterion is equal to 1 x 1 + 0 
x 1 + (- 1) x 1 = 0 / 3 = 0.  
For person 2 criterion C is twice as important as the other criteria. The score of the total score equals 0 x 1 + 1 x 1 + (0) x2 = 
1 / 4 = 0.25   
Person 3, judges criterion 3 to be three times as important as both other sub-criteria, the score of the criterion equals 1 x 1 + 0 x 
(-1) + 1 x1 =-2/2 =1

Step 7:  Analyse the results  
The analysis of the results and comparison between alternatives can be done by comparing the overall scores or by 
comparing scores on single criterion. Finally, based on the obtained results, recommendations can be made regarding 
which alternative would be the best (overall) or which performs best on a single criterion. 

 

4.1.2  Strengths and weaknesses of multi-criteria analysis 

Strengths of multi-criteria analysis: 
 
 
  Makes the appraisal and decision-making process more transparent. 

Enables taking into account project impacts that are not easily given monetary values. 
Facilitates stakeholder involvement. 

Weaknesses of multi-criteria analysis: 
  No built-in standard value, as it applies project specific values (criteria and weights). 
  Comparisons between studies with different valuation criteria and weights are very limited.  
  Requires well developed participation processes and strongly depends on stakeholder willingness to participate.

4.1.3  Example of multi-criteria analysis application 

Espelta and al (2003) have analysed different types of vegetation clearing (mechanical, controlled burning or grazing), 
soil preparation (ripping or planting holes) and reforestation methods (broadcast seeding, spot seeding and planting) to 
restore black pine (Pinus nigra) forests. They compared these practices in terms of seedling establishment, but also in 
the light of their economic costs and ecological impact, through a MCA. This study was carried out in the regions of 
Bages  and  Bergueda  in  Catalonia  (north-east  of  Spain)  on  three  burnt  sites.  On  each  of  the  sites  they  tested  four 
different vegetation clearing treatments (livestock grazing, controlled burning, mechanical clearing and no vegetation 
clearing), two reforestation methodologies (planting, sowing), and two soil preparation methods (ripping and planting 
holes). Different combinations of the above treatments were applied. 

To evaluate treatment combinations (alternative), five criteria were used: 

 

Financial  cost:  monetary  cost  of  the  different  combinations  of  vegetation  clearing  and  soil  preparation 
methods conducted; 
Survival of black pine seedlings: density of black pine seedlings surviving at the end of the experiment; 

 
  Height growth of black pine seedlings: absolute mean height growth of black pine seedlings between the start 

and the end of the experiment; 

  Density of small mammals: computed as the difference between the abundance of small mammals captured 

per plot at the beginning and at the end of the 2 years study; 

  Diversity of small mammals: computed as the difference in the Shannon diversity index of the community of 

small mammals at the beginning and at the end of the 2 years study.

Figure 4.1: Ranking of alternatives  

Note: Left values, ranking based on the better and much better relations (values range from 0 to 1, indicating how an alternative is 
better than the rest). Right numbers, ranking based on the worse and much worse relations (values range from 0 to 1, indicating how 
an alternative is worse than the rest). 

The results show that seedling establishment after sowing was very poor and not influenced by vegetation clearing. In 
plantations,  seedling  survival  was  higher  in  the  ripper  treatment  than  in  planting  holes  for  all  vegetation  clearing 
treatments except the control one. Nevertheless, the higher economic cost of the planting holes treatment and the 
negative impact of mechanical clearing and burning on the community of small mammals made the stated differences in 
seedling survival irrelevant. Thus, the MCA revealed that the two most preferred options were planting in un-cleared 
or lightly grazed areas with soil preparation through ripping.  

4.2  Cost benefit analysis (CBA) 

Cost-benefit  analysis  (CBA)  is  a  technique  for  the  assessment  of  the  relative  desirability  of  competing  alternatives 
(events, project, management or policy measures). The assessment involves the comparison of the current (base case) 
situation  to  one  or  more  alternatives  considering  the  differences  between  the  base  case  and  the  alternatives.  For 
example, to evaluate the impact of the application of thinning on the output of forest goods and services in a particular 
forest, the base case (without thinning) would be compared to the alternative scenario (with thinning). The analysis 
would focus on the differences in costs and benefits, in the situations with and without the management measure. The 
CBA compares the costs and benefits measured in monetary terms.  

The cost-benefit analysis can be conducted from different perspectives (Figure 4.2). Private CBA considers only those 
costs and benefits from the analysed alternative, which are imposed onto or accrue to a private agent (e.g. individual 
or firm). Thus, it also considers transfer payments (e.g., subsidies, taxes), which the private agent receives or pays to 
the administration. This variety of CBA is also often called financial appraisal.  

Social CBA  in  turn  attempts  to  assess  the  overall  impact  of  an alternative  on  the  welfare  of  the  society  as  a  whole, 
rather than of the agent that implements the project. Social analysis differs from the private analysis in terms of (i) the 
breadth  of  the identification  and  evaluation  of  inputs  and  outputs,  and  (ii)  the  measure  of costs  and  benefits.  Social 
CBA considers the costs and benefits which accrue to the society as a whole. Social costs and benefits usually differ 
from private ones because of the existing market imperfections, which may take the form of:  

Imperfect competition in the market (e.g. monopoly power);  

 
  Government intervention in the market (e.g. taxes, subsidies, price regulation);  

34 

 

 

 

Externalities3 and public goods.  

Furthermore, a social CBA does not consider transfer payments, like subsidies or taxes, as they are both benefit and 
cost. For example, a subsidy is a benefit for the forest owner, but at the same time is a cost for the tax payers. Thus, 
from the social point of view it is a neutral transfer between two agents, which does not affect the overall well-being 
of the society. 

Figure 4.2: Different perspectives on the cost-benefit analysis 

 
Ideally, social CBA should take into account all the impacts of the analysed alternative, including those that are difficult 
to measure (e.g. usually related to environmental externalities).  

 

4.2.1  Step of a cost-benefit analysis 

The implementation of a CBA follows a set of steps: 

Step 1: Event, project or policy definition 
A first step in establishing a framework for the analysis is to describe the event, project or policy in sufficient detail in 
order  to  be  able  to  determine  the  relevant  benefits  and  costs.  To  accomplish  this  at  least  the  following  should  be 
defined: 

 

Event, project or policy: that should clearly state what is the issue at hand, which problem(s) might occur due 
to an event or which problems the project seeks to mitigate, what goal(s) it addresses, what  if anything  
will be done, where, when, how and by whom. The nature of the problem or goal will determine its intended 
benefits and recipients. The unintended effects and the affected parties should also be identified, even if these 
effects may be left out of the CBA. 
 

                                                        

3 An externality is defined as an unintended action caused by an economic agent that influences the utility of another agent 
(external) without being fully or directly reflected by market prices (Merlo and Croitoru 2005). 

35 

 

 

 

 

Purpose of the CBA: Identifying the purpose of the analysis helps to define the level of detail appropriate for 
the study. A set of questions should be answered: will the analysis be used to determine if a project should be 
undertaken? Will it be used to determine which of a group of projects should be selected or which should 
have highest priority? Will it be used to define the impact of an event?  
 
Base case and the alternatives: the base case is the situation that will prevail if the event does not occur or 
the project is not undertaken or if the policy is not implemented. The proposed alternatives correspond to 
specific events that might happen or actions that can be undertaken. 
 

  Time horizon: it starts with the first project expenditures, and extends through the useful life of the project 
or its most long-lived alternative, or some future time at which meaningful estimates of effects are no longer 
possible. The costs and benefits are compared and evaluated for this time horizon. The general principles for 
selecting the time horizon are:  

o 
o 

It should be long enough to capture the majority of costs and benefits; 

It  should  be  consistent  with  the  time  horizon  used  for  other  analyses  being  undertaken  for  the 
event - project; 

It should be consistent for all alternatives; 

o 
o  All  benefits  and  costs  occurring  or  accruing  over  this  time  horizon  should  be  included  in  the 

analysis.  

Step 2: Identification of relevant project impacts  
Once  the  event,  project  or  policy  is  defined,  the  next  step  is  to  identify  the  impacts  of  its  occurrence  or 
implementation.  Both  tangible  and  intangible  impacts  should  be  recognized.  First,  the  resources  used  in  the 
implementation of the project should be specified (e.g. labour, raw materials, etc.). Second, the effects of the project 
on market prices and output levels of the marketed goods or services in focus, the local employment levels, market 
prices of related goods and services, as well as the impacts on the surrounding environment should be identified.  

The  positive  impacts    called  benefits    refer  to  the  increases  in  the  quantity  or  quality  of  goods  or  services  that 
generate positive utility or a reduction in the price at which they are supplied. The negative impacts  called costs  
stand for any decreases in the quality or quantity of such goods or services, or increases in their price. The negative 
impacts also include the usage of resources (inputs in production) in the project, since they cannot be simultaneously 
used in any other.  

The cost-benefit and cost-efficiency analyses are based on incremental benefits and costs. An important concept in this 
respect is additionality, which refers to the net impacts of the project (Hanley and Spash, 1993). This means that the 
costs  of  the  project  that  are  relevant  for  the  assessment  are  those  that  would  be  incurred  if  the  project  were 
undertaken, but that would not be incurred otherwise.  

The opportunity cost of the project measures the best alternative option forgone as a result of undertaking the project. 
Similarly, the benefit of the project is the extra amount of a good (e.g. money, time, etc.) that would be gained if the 
project were undertaken rather than not undertaken (Sugden and Williams, 1978). 

Whenever the implementation of a certain project has an impact on the environment representing positive or negative 
externalities,  these  external  effects  must  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  process  of  project  evaluation.  Typical 
environmental  effects  are  associated  with  air  quality,  climate  changes,  water  quality,  soil  and  groundwater  quality, 
biodiversity and landscape degradation and other natural risks.  

The impacts of a proposed project may be unevenly distributed across different individuals and population groups, as 
well as across different geographical regions affected by the project. If distributional effects are to be considered in 
CBA, the costs and benefits for different groups of agents must be determined in order to identify the winners and the 
losers of the proposed project.  

 

36 

 

Step 3: Physical quantification of relevant impacts 
This stage involves determining the physical amounts of cost and benefit flows for a project (e.g. in man-days of labour, 
tons of CO2, etc.), and identifying when in time they will occur. For example, if considering the benefits and costs of 
improved forest management, which would result in increased wood production. The annual increment of wood (e.g., 
m3/ha) would be estimated before the improved management and afterwards. Furthermore, the time (e.g., years) it will 
take that this improved wood production is achieved need to be estimated. 

Step 4: Monetary valuation of relevant impacts 
In order for physical measures of impacts to be comparable, they must be valued in common units (e.g. euro). The 
CBA values all the costs and the benefits in monetary units. The general principle of monetary valuation in CBA is to 
value impacts in terms of their marginal social cost or marginal social benefit.  

The  marginal  social  cost  measures  the  opportunity  cost  of  producing  a  good  or  service,  while  the  marginal  social 
benefit  represents  the  marginal  willingness to pay  (WTP)  of  the  consumers  for  that  good  or  service.  Market  prices, 
under certain conditions, can contain correct information about the social costs and social benefits. However, in many 
cases prices do not adequately reflect the true value of a good and a service to society.  

Market power, externalities, taxes or subsidies can distort market prices. Whenever such distortions occur, shadow 
prices are used as estimates of marginal social costs and benefits to reflect the true value of a good or service.  

In  some  instances,  market  prices  do  not  exist  for  relevant  impacts.  This  is  the  case  of  many  environmental 
externalities,  such  as  landscape  quality,  air  quality  or  biodiversity.  In  this  case  valuation  techniques  must  be  used  in 
order  to  estimate  the  WTP  for  changes  in  the  quantity  of  these  externalities.  The  main  valuation  techniques  are 
further presented in the chapter 5 of this report. 

Step 5: Discounting of costs and benefits 
Once  all  the  relevant  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  monetary  terms,  it  is  necessary  to  convert  them  into  a 
common metric, their present value. This process is called discounting and it is based on the fact that the individuals have 
time  preferences  between  consumption  in  different  periods.  According  to  this  assumption,  an  individual  is  not 
necessarily indifferent between receiving 100  today and receiving the same 100  in ten years. This is true even if 
there is no inflation, because 100  today can be used productively in the consequent ten years, producing a value 
greater than the initial 100 . The rate at which an individual is willing to exchange the present consumption for the 
future consumption is called the discount rate. The higher is the discount rate, the greater preference is given to the 
present consumption.  

The present value (PV) of a cost or a benefit X received in time t given the discount rate r is calculated as follows: 

PV

Discounting can be done in two ways, where both approaches should give identical answers: 

 

 

By computing the net value of benefits minus costs for each time period (e.g. each year), and discounting each 
of these annual net benefit flows through the lifespan of the project; 
By calculating discounted values for each element of the project (costs and benefits), and then summing the 
discounted elements.  

The discount rate used in social CBA is the social discount rate (see Box 4.2), which attempts to reflect the social view 
on how future benefits and costs should be valued against present ones. This discount rate usually differs from the 
discount rate used in private CBA (financial appraisal), because of the imperfections in the capital markets.  

Theoretical literature and international practice list different approaches in choosing the value of the social discount 
rate to be adopted. However, the most common solution is to use the market interest rate. Long-term borrowing 
rate  of  the  government  and  the  pre-tax  rate  of  return  to  private  capital  are  often  used  as  proxies  for  the  social 
discount rate (Nas, 1996). 

37 

 

 

Box 4.2 Social discount rate 

The theoretical literature distinguishes several approaches for interpreting and choosing the value of the social discount rate. 
The aim of this report it is not to summarize the academic debate on this topic, but to provide a brief introduction of the 
main concepts used in the estimation of the social discount rate.  

Social time preference rate (STPR) 
STPR  measures  the  societys  preferences  between  consumption  in  one  period  and  consumption  in  another.  The 
approximated formula for the STPR, r, based on Ramsey (1928) is: 

r = ng + p, 

where  p  is  the  rate  of  pure  inter-temporal  preference  (utility  discount  rate),  n  is  the  elasticity  of  marginal  utility  of 
consumption, and g is the growth rate of per capita real consumption. In most European countries the rate of pure inter-
temporal  preference  is  about  1%,  the  growth  rate  is  around  2%  and  the  elasticity  of  marginal  utility  of  consumption  is 
between 1 and 2 (EC, 2002). This implies that the STPR is in the range of 3%-5%.  

Opportunity cost of capital 
The opportunity cost of capital measures the value of the input in the best possible alternative use. When capital is invested 
in  a  particular  project,  the  opportunity  cost  of  capital  accounts  for  the  loss  of  income  from  an  alternative  project.  The 
empirical estimation of the relevant opportunity cost of capital depends on the project, country and time. According to some 
authors, the social discount rate is lower than the market return on capital due to taxation (Hanley and Spash, 1993). Others 
propose  that  the  marginal  public  investment  should  have  the  same  return  as  the  private  one  (EC,  2002).  The  European 
Commission suggests the rate of 5% as the lower end of the opportunity cost of capital for private investors (EC, 2002).  

Source: EC, 2002; Hanley and Spash, 1993 

For  project  appraisal  different  countries  suggest  discount  rates  between  3  and  5%  (Table  4.2).  For  example,  the 
European Commission suggests using a 5% social discount rate in the case of European member states (EC, 2002). This 
is a compromise figure based on the market interest rate, cost of capital and social time preference considerations 
(see Box 4.2).

World Bank and EBRD adopt 10% economic rate of return (EC, 2002), which is usually considered as a high cut-off 
rate and is usually justified by considering development oriented cases. However, in this case the future benefits, are 
considered as less important (e.g., decreasing the importance of benefits for the next generations). 

Thus, when evaluating long term projects (30 years and longer) it is suggested to apply declining discount rates (Table 
4.3).  The  lower  discount  rates  over  the long  term  increases  net  present  values  (NPV)  of  projects  that  provide  net 
benefits  far  into  the  future  (i.e.  the  lower  the  discount  rate  the  higher  the  current  value  of  benefits  (and  costs) 
encountered in the future). Therefore, it is likely that NPVs of forestry projects will often be higher when long-term 
declining discount rates are applied.

The  choice  of  discount  rate  has  a  critical  impact  on  the  analysis.  The  reason  is  that  with  discount  rates,  the  more 
distant the costs and the closer the benefits are in time, the better a project will be evaluated. And this effect gets 
more  and  more  pronounced  with  higher  discount  rates.  Figure  4.3  demonstrates  the  impact  of  a  discount  rate  on 
present  value  estimates.  When  evaluating  alternative  projects,  a  sensitivity analysis  using  a  range  of  discount  rates  is 
typically used to determine the importance of the discount rate in the relative performance of the projects.

Step 6: Calculating the CBA performance indicators 
The main performance indicators for the cost-benefit analysis are: 

  The net present value; 
  The internal rate of return; 
  The benefit-cost ratio; 
  The payback period. 

 

The  most  appropriate  performance  indicator  (or  criteria)  to  use  in  project  appraisal  usually  depends  on  the 
circumstances. In this sub-chapter the use of these indicators in the evaluation of alternatives is explained.  

Net present value  

The net present value (NPV) of a project is defined as:

where St is the net benefit of the project at time t, d is the discount rate and T is the time frame (the last year of the 
project). The net benefit of the project is the difference between the benefits (Bt) and costs (Ct) associated with the 
studied alternative.  

 

39 

 

The net present value is a simple indicator which is useful both for identifying beneficial projects and for selecting the 
best project out of several alternatives. A project is accepted whenever NPV > 0, because its benefits outweigh the 
costs. The greater the NPV, the more desirable is the project. Therefore, alternative projects can be ranked on the 
basis of their net present values.  

When dealing with investment projects, in which early costs are followed by later returns, the negative values in the first 
years are weighted more heavily than the positive ones in the last years. The opposite happens when a disinvestment 
project is in question. This implies that the choice of the time frame (T) and the discount rate (d) are crucial for the 
determination of the NPV.  

Internal rate of return  

The internal rate of return (IRR) is defined as the critical value of the interest rate at which the project has a net present 
value of zero, in other words, when all costs are equal to all benefits when discounted by that rate.

IRR is usually expressed as a percentage. The calculation of the IRR does not require the identification of the discount 
rate. However, it should be remembered that any project that has relatively large positive net flows in early stages will 
generate a relatively large IRR. Thus, IRR tends to favour short-term investments (Klemperer, 1996). 

When dealing with investment projects, the interpretation of the IRR is straightforward. The project is acceptable if and 
only if the IRR is greater than the actual value of the interest rate. For disinvestment projects  projects where early 
returns are followed by later costs  the interpretation of IRR is different. In this case IRR is interpreted as the lowest 
value of the interest rate that would justify undertaking the project. Thus, the project should be undertaken if IRR is 
lower than the true value of the interest rate.  

IRR  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  cost-benefit  flows  are  reinvested  at  the  internal  rate  of  return.  When 
examining mutually exclusive projects, IRR may yield results that are inconsistent with the ranking based on the NPV 
criterion. In addition, IRR is not an appropriate criterion to be used when capital rationing exists4.  

Benefit-cost ratio  

The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is the relation between the discounted benefits and the discounted costs: 

BCR

If BCR > 1, then the discounted benefits outweigh the discounted costs, meaning the project results in net gains for 
the  society.  The  higher  the  BCR,  the  greater  are  the  benefits  in  proportion  to  the  costs.  However,  the  BCR  is 
insensitive to the magnitude of net benefits and, therefore, may favour projects with smaller costs and benefits over 
those with higher net benefits.  

Payback period 

Payback period indicates how long it takes for the accumulated benefits to exceed the accumulated costs. In order to 
determine  the  payback  period,  the  costs  and  benefits  should  be  discounted,  and  then  the  accumulated  costs  and 
accumulated benefits should be calculated for each year. The first year in which the accumulated benefits exceed the 
accumulated costs is the so-called payback period.  

If  all  other  indicators/criteria  are  equal,  the  better  investment  is  the  one  with  the  shorter  payback  period.  For 
example, if a project costs 100,000  and is expected to return 20,000  annually, the payback period will be five years 
(100,000 /20,000 ). 
                                                        

4 Capital rationing refers to the situation when a fixed capital budget exists and cannot be exceeded.

Step 7: Performing sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity  analysis  is  a  method  for  examining  how  the  outcome  of  the  CBA  changes  with  variations  in  inputs, 
assumptions  or  the  setup  of  the  analysis.  Typically,  the  sensitivity  analysis  should  be  performed  when  the  following 
parameters change (Hanley and Spash, 1993): 

  The discount rate; 
 
 
 

Physical quantities and qualities of inputs and outputs; 
Shadow prices of these inputs and outputs; 
Life span of the project. 

The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to determine the critical variables and parameters from the model, that is, 
those to which the NPV outcome is most sensitive.  

Sensitivity analysis can be performed either on a variable-by-variable basis or by changing groups of variables at the 
same time using scenario analysis. Below, a brief overview of how these analyses can be used in the CBA is presented, 
as well as the advantages and disadvantages of sensitivity analysis are discussed. 

Variable-by-variable analysis 

This approach attempts to isolate the effect of a change in one variable on the performance indicators of the CBA (e.g. 
NPV, BCR, etc.). It is performed in four steps. 

1.  All important factors affecting the cost-benefit flows should be listed. 
2.  For  each  factor,  a  range  of  possible  values  should  be  defined.  For  example,  the  estimates  for  each  factor 
could  be  prepared  under  best-case  (optimistic),  most  likely,  or  worst-case  (pessimistic)  scenarios.  In 
practice, these values are usually based on past experience with similar project evaluations or expert opinion. 
Moreover, the range is sometimes expressed as one or two standard deviations from a mean (or an expected 
value). 

3.  For each value of each factor the relevant performance indicators should be calculated holding the values of 

all the other factors unchanged.  

4.  The resulting performance indicators should be examined to determine the degree of overall variation and 

which factor or factors is/are most responsible for variation in the estimates.  

Scenario analysis 

Scenario analysis relies on the assumption that factors affecting cost-benefit flows do not operate independently of one 
another  as  it  is  assumed  in  the  variable-by-variable  approach.  In  scenario  analysis,  the  potential  future  states  of  the 
world are divided into best, worst and most likely scenarios. The best case scenario is based on the lowest estimate for 
costs  and  the  most  optimistic  estimates  for  benefits.  The  worst  case  scenario  is  based  upon  the  most  pessimistic 
estimates of costs and benefits.  

Advantages and disadvantages of sensitivity analysis 

Sensitivity analysis has several advantages. First, it is relatively easy to compute the necessary information required for 
each approach. Moreover, in many cases the analysis can be based on the range of values around the most likely case, 
without the need to undertake a great deal of work. Second, sensitivity analysis provides additional information for the 
decision-making. Particularly, it provides an insight on the impact and importance of uncertainty for the CBA. Finally, 
the potential interaction of factors is revealed when scenario analysis is employed. 

The main disadvantage is related to the accuracy of information upon which the values that correspond to variations in 
key  factors  are  determined.  The  methods  determining  pessimistic,  optimistic  and  most  likely  estimates  are  in  many 
cases subjective. Second, the lack of a systematic method for determining the appropriate combination of factors used 
to define given scenarios limits the reliability of sensitivity analysis. Finally, while the variable-by-variable approach fails 
to account for factor interaction, the scenario approach usually only includes a small number of potential scenarios.

4.2.2  Strengths and weaknesses of the cost benefit analysis 

Strengths of the cost benefit analysis: 

Based on well-understood theoretical foundations. 

 
  Has a built-in standard for value (in monetary terms). 
  Only includes benefits that are corresponding to beneficiaries, which actually value the impact. 
 

Because all CBA studies share a common methodology, lessons learned in one study can be easy transferred 
to other studies. 
Better  adopted  to  be  used  in  benefit  transfer  -  to  estimate  benefits  in  one  situation  by  extrapolation  or 
interpolation from previous studies of similar situations. 

 

Weaknesses of the cost benefit analysis: 

 
 

Limited only to impacts that can be measured in monetary terms. 
Strong influence on the results of the selected CBA parameters (e.g., discount rate, project duration, costs 
and benefits considered) 

4.2.3  Example of CBA application 

In this chapter an example is presented to demonstrate the application of CBA to project evaluation. This example is 
drawn from Mavsar (2012).  

The purpose of the CBA analysis was to analyse the social benefits of an afforestation project in the Mediterranean 
part  of  Spain.  The  afforestation  was  conducted  on  abandoned  agricultural  land  and  it  was  expected  to  have  the 
following impacts: 

 

Positive impacts (benefits):  

Increased forest area;  
Increased carbon sequestration;  
Increased diversity of plant species; 

o 
o 
o 
o  Recreation access. 
  Negative impacts (costs):  
Initial investment; 
Increased maintenance costs. 

o 
o 

Three  different  afforestation  scenarios  were  developed  (Table  4.4),  differing  in  the  size  of  the  afforestation  area, 
number of additional plant species in the region, recreational access and the quantity of additionally sequestered CO2.

For each of the benefits the marginal value have been estimated (i.e., the value of an additional unit of that good or 
service).  These  values  were  obtained  in  a  choice  experiment  valuation  study,  where  respondents  were  asked  to 

 

42 

 

express  their  preferences  regarding  afforestation  projects  and  the  output  of  different  forest  goods  and  services 
(Mavsar 2012). The choice experiment was conducted on the whole territory of Spain and a total of 800 respondents 
were intervied. The results (marginal values for the benefits) of the choice experiment are presented in Table 4.5.

To conduct the CBA, the following assumptions were adopted:  

  The afforestation is conducted in initial year (year 0). The average afforestation costs for were assumed to be 
10,669/ha. The afforestation cost were based on the data used for Spain by the European Commission in 
the frame of the rural development policy 2007-2013 (EU, 2005).  

  The initial investment is made in year 0, while every five years there are maintenance costs to bear, which are 

5% of the initial investment.  

  The benefits will be obtained only 25 years after the afforestation. This was based on the assumption that a 
young forest will not be able to provide all the benefits (e.g., carbon sequestration level) as a middle aged or 
mature forest. 

  The  project  duration  was  limited  to  46  years,  which  is  considered  as  a  normal  rotation  period  in 

Meditarranean pine forests in Spain (Palahi and al., 2007). 

  The discount rate was 3% (see Box 4.2).   

The detailed calculation results are given in table 4.6. For this example, the calculation for the Alternative 3 is only 
presented.

The  estimated  CBA  indicators  are  provided  in  table  4.7.  The  NPV  for  all  three  alternatives  are  positive.  However, 
when applying different discount rates (i.e., 1%, 3% and 5%) the performance indicators change significantly. Also when 
using  the  highest  discount  rate  all  alternatives  have  a  positive  NPV  and  a  BCR  greater  than  1.  From  an  economic 
perspective,  and  considering  the  used  assumptions,  the  first  afforestation  programme  (Alternative  1)  is  the  best 
alternative which performs best regardless which indicator is considered.

4.3  CBA or MCA? 

The main strength of MCA is that it enables taking into account project impacts for which it is not easy to estimate 
monetary  values.  Further  strengths  of  MCA  are  that  it  facilitates  stakeholder  involvement,  and  that  it  makes  the 
appraisal and decision-making process more transparent. 

However, the ability of MCA to take account of a wider range of project impacts than can CBA is a product of its 
much looser theoretical structure.  

The main strength of CBA is that it is based on well-understood theoretical foundations. This gives CBA a high degree 
of  internal  consistency.  Because  all  CBA  studies  share  a  common  methodology,  lessons  learned  in  one  study  (or, 
indeed,  in  microeconomics  more  generally)  can  be  easy  transferred  to  other  studies,  allowing  the  accumulation  of 
expertise. 

It  is  particularly  significant  that  CBA  has  a  built-in  standard  for  value.  For  example,  benefits  are  measured  by  the 
maximum  amount  of  money  that  beneficiaries  would  pay  for  them.  Thus  in  a  CBA  any  given  benefit  or  cost  is 
expressed in an absolute amount of money. It is not defined relative to any particular view about the objectives of the 
project  that  creates  those  benefits  or  costs.  CBA  only  includes  benefits  that  are  corresponding  to  a  class  of 
beneficiaries,  which  actually  value  the  impact.  It  is  not  open  to  the  any  stakeholder  to  stipulate  that  some  type  of 
impact is desirable or valuable.  

In  contrast,  MCA  has  no  built-in  standard  value.  It  might  seem  that  this  feature  gives  MCA  greater  flexibility.  But 
meaningful comparisons can be made between appraisals only if they use a common standard of value. MCA applies a 
standard  of  value  that  is  specific  to  a  project,  in  two  senses.  First,  the  relative  weights  given  to  different  impact 

 

45 

 

categories  are  defined  separately  for  each  project,  to  reflect  the  particular  concerns  of  stakeholders  at  the  project 
level.  Second,  the  system  for  scoring  impacts  uses  project-specific  scales.  Thus,  scores  are  not  comparable  across 
projects, only across alternative options for a given project (e.g. different levels of forest management measures at a 
given  site).  This  prevents  the  scores  from  being  used  in choosing  between  projects    one  of  the  main  functions  of 
appraisal. For the same reason, cross-project inconsistencies in decision-making are made harder to detect  a serious 
loss of transparency relative to CBA.  

Because different CBA studies use a common standard of value, a much larger set of studies can be used to test the 
credibility of the findings of any particular one. As experience of CBA accumulates, it becomes possible to use benefit 
transfer methods (i.e. to estimate benefits in one situation by extrapolation or interpolation from previous studies of 
similar situations) (see also Chapter 5 section 5.3.2.3).  

Nevertheless, MCA and CBA can be seen as complementary methods. For example, in cases where a broad range of 
different alternatives exist, MCA can help to define a narrow set of options and CBA is the used to evaluate them. 
Furthermore, CBA can be used to handle measurable costs and benefits while MCA deals with qualitative costs and 
benefits. So, the question is not that much which method is better, but rather how to combine them in a most efficient 
way.

5. Valuation methods 

The  objective  of  this  chapter  is  to  present  the  basic  concepts  related  to  the  economic  valuation  of  forest  goods  and 
services,  and  to  describe  the  main  valuation  methods.  The  economic  valuation  can  contribute  to  an  improved  decision 
making processes as it helps to understand the social preferences for the whole range of forest goods and services. The 
total economic value concept has been developed as a guarantee that all the benefits are considered systematically and 
comprehensively, without any double counting.  

Economic valuation methods attempt to elicit the monetary value of a certain change in the quantity and/or quality of the 
environmental  goods  and  services.  The  main  types  for  these  methods  are  revealed  preference  and  stated  preference 
methods. The revealed preference methods (e.g., market price and cost based methods, hedonic pricing method, travel 
cost method) are based on actual observed people behaviours. The stated preference methods (e.g., contingent valuation, 
choice modelling) are based on people responses to questions describing hypothetical markets or situations.  

A specific method is the benefit transfer, which is not a valuation method, but uses (transfers) economic estimates from 
previous studies that have similar changes in environmental goods and services, to estimate the value of environmental 
changes at the valued site.  

Only  a  few  of the  many  benefits  that  Mediterranean  forests  provide  enter  formal  markets,  usually  WFPs  and  some 
NWFPs (Daly and al., 2010). For these goods and services that are traded in formal markets, their price provides an 
estimation of their value and scarcity. Other forest benefits are either traded only in informal markets, as is typically 
the  case  for  many  NWFPs  (e.g.  firewood  for  self-consumption).  Estimation  of  their  value  can  be  obtained  through 
established markets for substitute products.  

However,  other  goods  and  services  do  not  enter  markets  at  all  (Merlo  and  Croitoru,  2005)  and  despite  being 
consumed by the society or forest owners, they do not have a price that would serve as an indicator of their scarcity 
or  to  predict  their  demand  (Sills  and  Abt.,  2004).  This  mostly  means  that  management  decisions  only  consider  the 
marketed goods and services, but omit non-market component of the provided benefits. Such management decisions 
tend to be suboptimal, as the focus is placed on the production of commodities, and may lower the provision of non-
market goods and services to an extent that it results in a net social welfare loss (losses are higher than the benefits 
obtained by the production of these commodities) (Holmes, 2004). 

To correct this situation, economists have developed a set of methods that can be applied to estimate the economic 
value of non-market goods and services. This chapter presents the most commonly applied methods, how they are 
applied, and which are their main strengths and weaknesses.  

In the context of this project, economic valuation methods will provide the needed inputs (i.e., values of ecosystem 
goods and services) to perform the evaluation of different forest management alternatives.  

5.1  Introduction to the concept of total economic value 

Managed  ecosystems  are  almost  constantly  changing  as  the  result  of  natural  processes  and  human  interventions 
(Turner, 2000). As explained in the previous chapter, it is important to be able to assess the impact of alternative sets 
of  management  actions  or  strategies  in  order  to  judge  their  social  acceptability  against  a  range  of  criteria  such  as 
environmental  effectiveness,  economic  efficiency,  fairness  across  different  stakeholder  interests  (including  different 
generations), etc. (Turner, 2000). 

 

47 

 

The  data  required  for  monitoring  environmental  change  can  be  classified  in  terms  of  three  dimensions  of  value 
(Turner, 2000): 

 

 

 

Primary value possessed by ecosystems: related to the ecosystem integrity in terms of structure, composition 
and  functioning.  Both  quantitative  and  qualitative  descriptive  indicators  of  ecosystem  integrity  are required 
because of the level of uncertainty that surrounds the scientific understanding of the functioning of complex 
systems. 
 
Socio-cultural,  historical  and  symbolic  values,  which  are  inherent  in  some  environmental  assets:  when 
evaluating a management action, the social welfare account should include changes in properties such as sense 
of identity, culture and historical significance of ecosystem components and landscapes. Compiling values data 
in this context is likely to be a more qualitative exercise, involving more deliberative and inclusionary interest 
group approaches such as consensus conferences, citizen juries and focus group interviewing.  
 
Total  economic  value  (TEV)  assigned  to  ecosystem  function  outputs:  the  TEV  concept  links  ecosystem 
processes  and  functioning  with  outputs  of  goods  and  services,  which  can  be  assigned  monetary  economic 
values. 

This chapter focuses on the TEV and on how monetary values can be assigned to ecosystem outputs. The TEV is an 
anthropocentric concept that stresses values that bring benefits to human beings whether directly or indirectly (Merlo 
and Croitoru, 2005).  

The wide range of benefits that ecosystems provide requires a coherent analytical framework. The concept of TEV has 
been  developed  as  a  guarantee  that  the  benefits  are  considered  systematically  and  comprehensively,  without  any 
double counting. In recent years, the TEV has been widely used to quantify the full value of the different components 
of  ecosystems,  such  as  forests  (Merlo  and  Croitoru,  2005).  The  TEV  is  the  sum  of  use  values  and  non-use  values. 
These two main TEV categories can be further broken down as follows: 

  Use Values 

o  Direct  use  value:  includes  interaction  with  the  ecosystem  through  consumptive  use  such  as  the 

o 

harvesting of timber, or may be non-consumptive such as recreational activities.  
Indirect use value: is derived from ecosystem services, such as cleaner water to downstream users, 
carbon sequestration, and flood control or erosion prevention. 

o  Option value: considers having the option of using the resource in the future, directly or indirectly. 

  Non-Use Values  

o  Altruistic value: is derived from the satisfaction of knowing that other people have access to benefits 

of the nature. 

o  Bequest  value:  arises  from  the  interest  in  preserving  a  certain  ecosystem  or  species  for  future 

generations. 

o  Existence value: is derived from the knowledge of the existence of a particular ecosystem or species.  

Table 5.1 shows the TEV concept applied to forest ecosystems and how it relates to their ecological features. In the 
past,  use  values  were  most  important  and  their  provision was  the  main  objective  of  forest  management.  However, 
nowadays there is an increasing social demand for non-use values (Kramer and al., 2004).

When  assessing  the  TEV  or  a  particular  value  attention  should  be  placed  on  who  are  the  beneficiaries.  For 
example,  erosion  protection  mainly  benefits  local  populations,  while  recreational  services  can  benefit  both,  local 
population and visitors. Therefore, understanding preferences of an individual requires an examination of the specific 
subset of the benefits they receive from forests and the costs they have to recur. 

5.2  Economic valuation: purpose, implications and limitations  

5.2.1  A definition of economic valuation 

The  economic  valuation  is  a  set  of  techniques  and  methodologies  that  intend  to  measure,  in  monetary  terms,  the 
expected increase or decrease in welfare resulting from the use of a good or service (Romero, 1994).  

The economic valuation is implicitly linked to a choice. The value then arises from the interaction between a subject 
and an object (e.g., environmental good or service) as an expression of individuals preferences, and assuming that the 
changes in the provision of the good or service have an impact on the individual welfare. That is, the environmental 
benefit (or cost) is understood as a benefit (or cost) for the human being and it is expressed in monetary units.  

The substitutability between one and other goods is also central to the concept of value. The exchanges or sacrifices 
people  make  when  they  choose  less  quantity  of  a  given  good  and  substitute  it for  a  higher  amount  of  other  goods 
reveal the values people give to each of these goods (Freeman, 2003). 

5.2.2  Objectives of the economic valuation 

Following  Pritchard  (2000)  and  according  to  the  aim  of  this  report,  the  objectives  for  conducting  an  economic 
valuation study are:  

  Demonstrative  purposes,  to  show  that  forest  ecosystems  are  linked  to  human  well-being  and  should  be 

represented in the decision-making processes.  

  To describe the relative importance of different types of forest ecosystems.  
  To  support  or  reject  management  or  policy  decisions  that  will  influence  the  state  of  a  certain  forest 

ecosystem (e.g., through the use of cost-benefit analyses) 

It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  fundamental  aim  of  valuation  is  not  to  put  a  price  tag  on  a  certain  forest 
ecosystem, or its components, but rather to express the importance people put on changes in ecosystem goods and 
services  provision,  in  comparison  to  other  goods  or  services  (Randall,  2002;  Hanley  and  Shogren,  2002  in  Turner, 
2003). Accordingly, the assignation of a monetary value corresponds more to a need of establishing indicators, which 
can be used for the decision-making process, rather than of establishing a hierarchy of these goods and services.  

 

49 

 

In the Mediterranean, many of the forest ecosystem goods and services are only traded in informal markets or not at 
all.  Thus,  estimating  these  values  is  relevant  when  deciding  about  the  allocation  of  limited  resources  for  forest 
management or when considering alternative land uses.  

5.2.3  Basic assumptions in environmental valuation 

The environmental valuation relies on the neoclassic theory that presumes individuals make their choices with the aim 
to maximise their welfare. This maximization always takes place in presence of restrictions such as income, time or 
limited provision of goods or services. The value is therefore the outcome of preferences of an individual with limited 
means.  Through  their  choices  individuals  reveal  a  preference  order  for  a  set  of  goods  and  services,  which  can  be 
presented as a utility (welfare) function. The economic theory also assumes that preferences of an individual are well 
defined and are stable. These conditions are necessary for estimating and maximizing the social welfare (Shapansky and 
al., 2002).  

The  same  assumptions  (i.e.,  utility  maximization  of  an  individual,  and  established  and  stabile  preferences)  are  also 
adopted  in  the  environmental  valuation  framework.  Furthermore,  it  presumes  that  a  change  in  the  provision  of 
environmental goods and services has an impact on the welfare of an individual.  

Accordingly,  the  environmental  valuation  assesses  the  difference  in  welfare  (marginal  utility)  derived  from  a  change 
(increase  or  decrease)  in  the  provision  of  ecosystem  goods  or  services.  However,  the  marginal  utility  of  goods  or 
services is not constant. It increases with the scarcity of a good and decreases with its abundance. For example, the 
marginal utility of income (Figure 5.1) decreases as income of an individual increases. For a person with low income, 
every additional monetary unit received has a higher marginal utility, than for someone with a high income.  

Marginal

Income

As a consequence the estimated economic values are conditioned, among other things, by the scale of the change and 
the scarcity of the valued good or service. Although economic valuation has also been used to estimate the value of 
the  totality  of  ecosystem  goods  and  services  at  a  given  time  (e.g.,  Costanza  and al.,  1997).  This  approach  has  been 
strongly criticised (e.g. Pearce, 2001; Bockstael, 2000; Turner, 2003). For example, the removal of all forests would 
involve the loss of a major life support system and not only of recreation possibilities. Thus economic values are only 
applicable to small (marginal) changes in ecosystem services. 

Therefore,  the  assessed  monetary  values  can  only  be  used  to  express  the  changes  in  social  welfare  for  marginal 
variations  and  do  not  imply  a  large  scale  alteration  of  the  flow  of  environmental  goods  and  services  (Azqueta  and 
Tirado, 2008). Actually, it is the marginal nature of these changes in the quantity/quality of these environmental assets 
that is useful in the decision making process.

5.2.4  Requirements and limitations of environmental valuation 

The  first  step  in  applying  environmental  valuation  methods  is  to  characterize  the  decision  problem  and  the 
environmental change at stake.  

When defining the environmental change, there are some key questions, which have to be addressed, such as (Champ, 
2003):  

  Geographic and temporal scope; 
  Associated types of values; 
  Who benefits and who loses; 
  What type of values are affected; 

The  second  step  is  to  estimate  how  the  environmental  change  will  impact  the  flow  of  relevant  goods  and  services 
provided by the ecosystem. The nature of the value these goods and services portray (whether these are use values, 
non-use values, etc.) will have an important implication on the selection of the valuation technique.  

The  third  step,  directly  linked  with  the  previous,  is  the  identification  of  individuals  affected  by  the  change.  The 
distribution  of  the  potential  costs  and  benefits  and  the  scale  at  which  benefits  and  costs  are  captured  are  very 
important.  Local  users  are  more  affected  by  changes  in  direct  benefits  (e.g.,  consumption  and/or  sale  of  forest 
products), while at the countrywide or international level, individuals assign more importance to indirect services (e.g., 
carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation).  

Despite the potential of environmental economic valuation as a decision support tool, there are some constraints to 
its use. The main limitations and challenges for environmental valuation are found in situations where there is a lack of 
well-trained  individual  or  when  certain  services  cannot  be measured.    Figure  5.2  shows some  of  the difficulties  and 
constraints that may appear.

Figure 5.2: Challenges faced when moving from use to non-use values in environmental valuation 

As already mentioned, environmental valuation assumes that individuals have defined preferences for the valued goods 
and  services.  This  is  mostly  true  for  goods  and  services  that  are  commonly  known  to  individuals  (e.g.,  wood, 
mushrooms, and recreation). However, when asked to express their preferences for goods or services that they are 
not familiar with (e.g., existence of a plant species, biodiversity protection, soil erosion) (Bateman and al., 2008 a,b, 
2010), the preferences are only established during the valuation process (Atkinson, 2012). 

5.3  Economic valuation methods 

A  variety  of  environmental  valuation  methods  has  been  developed  to  estimate  the  value  of  ecosystem  goods  and 
services. The main types for these methods are revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) methods (table 5.2).

5.3.1  Revealed preference methods 

The revealed preference methods (RP) are based on actual observed behaviour data, including some techniques that 
deduce values indirectly from behaviour in surrogate markets, which are assumed to have a direct relationship with 
the ecosystem service of interest (Atkinson, 2012). These methods are suitable when a relationship exists between the 
environmental  good  or services at stake  and a functional  and well established market (Morrison and  al., 1996).  For 
example, often part of the real estate value is associated with the environmental quality (e.g., pollution level). It is very 
likely that RP methods underestimate the value of public goods, as they are not able to capture all the possible ways in 
which people benefit from them (i.e. non-use values). 

A  number  of  variants  of  the  revealed preference  methods  exist,  depending  on  whether  the  environmental  good  or 
service and the related market good are complements, substitutes, or one is an attribute of the other. The following 
sections provide descriptions for the most commonly applied RP valuation methods, namely, market price, cost based 
methods, hedonic pricing and travel cost method. 

5.3.1.1  Market price method  

5.3.1.1.1  General  

Market price method is used when the actual market for the valued good or service exists (e.g., timber, non-wood 
forest products, carbon). In this case, the valuation is done on the basis of observed market prices. The market price 

 

52 

 

valuation technique uses the standard economic methods for measuring the economic benefits from market impacts, 
based on the quantity demanded and supplied at different prices. Where market values exist, market price method 
should be preferred to any other valuation technique (Riera and al., 2005).  

In a market economy, monetary units (e.g., euro) are a universally accepted measure of economic value, because the 
number of monetary units that an individual is willing to pay for a good or service tells how much of other goods and 
services this individual is willing to give up. This is often referred to as willingness to pay (WTP).  

It is often incorrectly assumed that the market price of a good measures its economic value. The market price only 
indicates the minimum amount that people who buy the good or service are willing to pay for it (King and Mazzotta, 
2000). When people purchase a good or service, they compare the amount of money they are willing to pay for that 
good or service with its market price. They will only purchase the good or service if their WTP is greater or at least 
equal to the price. Many people are actually willing to pay more than the market price for a good or service, and thus 
their values exceed the market price. 

Figure 5.3 illustrates this difference, where VX1 represents the value (WTP) of the unit X1 of a good, while PX1 is the 
market  price  the  individuals  are  asked  to  pay  for  this  good.  The  illustration  clearly  shows  that  in  the  case  of  the 
product unit X1 the value is higher than the market price. The difference between the price actually paid for a good, 
and the maximum amount that an individual is willing to pay for it is called consumers surplus.  

 

Figure 5.3: Graphic representation of a demand function, value, market price and consumer surplus 

5.3.1.1.2  Main steps in the application of the market price valuation  

The objective is to measure total economic surplus for the change (increase or decrease) in provision of a good or 
service (e.g., improved wood production due to optimised forest management). This is the sum of consumer surplus 
plus producer surplus5.  

Thus, the value of the change in the provision of a good or service equals the difference between economic surplus 
before and after the management improvement. 

Step 1: Estimate of demand function before the change in provision 
The first step of the procedure is to use market data to estimate the market demand function6 and consumer surplus 
for  the  valued  good  or  service  before  the  change  in  the  provision.  An  example  is  presented  in  figure  5.4.  Given  a 
demand curve D and the initial market price MP1, the initial consumer surplus equals the light shaded area CS1.

variable production costs. 

53

provision 

Step 2: Estimate of demand function after the change in provision 
The second step is to estimate the market demand function and consumer surplus for the good or the service after 
the change in provision has  occurred. In figure 5.4 the provision of the valued good  or service will increase, which 
would result in a decreased market price (MP2), while the demand function (D) would remain unchanged. Thus, the 
consumer surplus after the change in provision would equal the sum of the area CS1 and CS2. 

Step 3: Estimate of the change in economic benefits to consumers 
The third step is to estimate the change (loss or gain) in economic benefits to consumers, by calculating the difference 
in benefits before and after the change in provision. In figure 5.4 this difference (increased benefits) would correspond 
to the area CS2.  

Step 4: Estimate of supply function before the change in economic benefits to producers 
Because this is a marketed good or service, the changes in producer surplus (e.g., forest owner producing the wood) 
should be considered. As with consumer surplus, the producers surplus before and after the change, are estimated and 
the difference is calculated.  

For example, in figure 5.5 for the production of a good or service the initial supply function is S1 and the market price 
is MP1. The resulting producer surplus is the sum of areas PS1 and PS2. 

Step 5: Estimate of supply function after the change in economic benefits to producers 
Next, the producer surplus is measured after the change in the provision of the valued good or service occurred. In 
figure 5.5, due to the increased supply, the market price decreased to MP2. Thus, the producer surplus is now only the 
area PS1.

units of a good will be purchased at different prices.

Step 6: Estimate of the change in economic benefits to producers 
The next step is to calculate the difference in producer surplus due to the change in the provision of the valued good 
or  service.  In  figure  5.5,  this  would  be  the  difference  between  the  initial  producer  surplus  (PS1+PS2)  and  the  final 
producer surplus (PS1). This means that the producer surplus after the change decreased by PS2.  

Step 7: Estimate of the total economic change  
The final step is to calculate the total economic change due to the modified provision of the valued good or service. 
This change equals the sum of changed consumer surplus and changed producer surplus. 

5.3.1.1.3 

Strengths and weaknesses of the market price method 

Strengths of the market price method 

  The market price method reflects a WTP of an individual for costs and benefits of goods or services that are 
bought  and  sold  in  markets,  such  as  fish,  timber,  or  fuel  wood.  Thus,  people  values  are  likely  to  be  well-
defined. 
Price, quantity and cost data are relatively easy to obtain for established markets. 

 
  The method uses observed data of actual consumer preferences. 
  The method uses accepted economic techniques. 

Weaknesses of the market price method 

  Market  data  may  only  be  available  for  a  limited  number  of  goods  and  services  provided  by  an  ecological 

resource and may not reflect the value of all productive uses of a resource. 

  The  true  economic  value  of  goods  or  services  may  not  be  fully  reflected  in  market  transactions,  due  to 

market imperfections and/or policy failures.  
Seasonal variations and other effects on price must be considered. 

 
  The method cannot be easily used to measure the value of larger changes that are significantly affecting the 

supply of or demand for a good or service. 

  Usually,  the  market  price  method  does  not  deduct  the  market  value  of  other  resources  used  to  bring 

ecosystem products to market, and thus may overstate benefits. 

5.3.1.1.4  Application of market price method 

The market price method uses prevailing prices for goods and services traded in markets, such as timber, mushrooms, 
berries,  cork,  medicinal  and  aromatic  plants,  decorative  plants  and  material,  game  meet,  hunting  licences,  etc.  The 

 

55 

 

study conducted by Daly and al. (2012) gives a good overview of the variety of goods and services for which market 
prices can be used to assess their economic value. 

Application of the market price method requires data to estimate consumer surplus and producer surplus. To estimate 
consumer surplus, the demand function must be estimated. This requires time series data on the quantity demanded at 
different prices, plus data on other factors that might affect demand, such as income or other demographic data. To 
estimate producer surplus, data on variable costs of production and revenues received from the good or service are 
required. However, in practice seldom all these information is available. Thus, mostly the value of a marginal change is 
estimated considering a stable market price.  

For  example,  Daly  and  al.  (2012)  estimated  the  value  of  annual  wood  production  for  the  forests  in  the  Barbra 
watershed basin. Forests cover around 31% of the total area of this watershed basin. One of the benefits these forests 
provide is wood. It was estimated that in 2010 the annual wood increment for the total area was 4,516 m3. A survey 
conducted in the study area showed that households consume on average 1.48 m3 of fire wood and 155 kg of charcoal 
per year. Multiplying these amounts by the number of households in the area this means that the total consumption 
was 10,351 m3 of wood (6,650 m3 of fire wood and 3,701 m3 wood for charcoal production), which is much higher 
than the estimated annual production capacity of the forests in the Barbra watershed basin. This clearly indicates the 
importance of the consideration of self-consumption of forest products by the population. 

To estimate the annual benefit of wood production for the local population the market price for fire wood was used, 
which was in 2010 around 4.35 7/m3. Thus, estimated the total annual benefit was 45,026 . 

5.3.1.2  Cost based methods 

5.3.1.2.1  General  

A particular case of market price methods is the group of cost based methods. This group includes the 
damage cost avoided method, replacement cost method, and substitute cost method. These methods can be 
used  to  estimate  values  of  ecosystem  goods  and  services  based  on  either  the  costs  of  avoiding 
damages due to lost goods and services, the cost of replacing ecosystem goods and services, or the 
cost  of  providing  substitute  goods  and  services  (King  and  Mazzotta,  2000).  Often  they  are  applied 
when  estimating  the  value  of  protecting  services  (e.g.,  flood  prevention,  erosion  mitigation,  dam 
sedimentation, water purification).  

However, they do not provide strictly measure of economic values, which are based on peoples WTP 
for  a  good  or  service.  Instead,  they  assume  that  the  costs  of  avoiding  damages,  replacing  or 
substituting ecosystems goods and services, are useful estimates of their value. This is based on the 
assumption  that,  if  people  incur  costs  to  avoid  damages  caused  by  lost  ecosystem  services,  or  to 
replace or substitute ecosystem goods and services, then those goods and services must be worth at 
least  what  people  paid  to  avoid  the  loss  or  substitute  or  replace  them.  These  methods  are  most 
appropriately applied in cases where damage avoidance or substitution or replacement expenditures 
have actually been, or will be, made.  

The main underlying assumptions for this approach refer to the predictability of the extent and nature 
of  physical  expected  damage  (there  is  an  accurate  damage  function  available)  and  that  the  costs  to 
substitute,  replace  or  restore  damaged  assets  can  be  estimated  within  a  reasonable  degree  of 
accuracy. It is further assumed that the substitution, replacement or restoration costs do not exceed 
the economic value of the good or service.  
                                                        

7 This price was recalculated from Tunisian dinar (TD) using an exchange rate 1 TD = 0.46 . 

 

56 

 

The latter assumption may not be valid in all cases. The value of a good or service may fall short of the 
replacement, substitution or restoration costs, either because there are few users or because the use 
of the good or service is in low-value activities.  

5.3.1.2.2  Main steps in the application of the cost based method 

An  example  will  be  used to  illustrate  the  main  steps  of  the cost  based  methods.  In  this  example  a  public  agency  is 
considering  to  restore  a  degraded  forest  area  to  improve  the  ability  of  these  forests  to  protect  the  surrounding 
agriculture area from erosion. Before implementing such a restoration, the value of the increased erosion protection 
will be estimated to assess the potential benefits. 

Step 1: Ecological assessment of the provided good or service 
The first step is to conduct a physical assessment of the valued ecosystem good or service (e.g., level of soil erosion in 
tonnes of eroded soil per ha and year). This assessment should determine the current level of the ecosystem good or 
service, and the expected level if any change in the ecosystem would occur (e.g., restoration of the degraded forest).  

Step 2: Cost assessment 
This step depends on the specific method chosen. 
The damage cost avoided method might be applied using two different approaches: 

  One approach is to use the information on erosion protection obtained in the first step to estimate potential 
damages to agriculture land if erosion is to occur. In this case, the monetary value of the probable damages 
to property, if the forest is not restored, is considered. 
 

  The  second  approach  would  be  to  determine  whether  nearby  property  owners  have  spent  money  to 
protect  their  property  from  the  possibility  of  erosion  damage,  for  example  by  purchasing  additional 
insurance or by reinforcing the protection of their agriculture land. These avoidance expenditures would be 
summed  over  all  affected  properties  to  provide  an  estimate  of  the  benefits  from  increased  erosion 
protection. Thus the restoration of the forest area would only be implemented if the avoidance costs are 
expected to be less than the possible damages to agricultural area. 

The  replacement  cost  method  is  applied  by  estimating  the  costs  of  replacing  the  affected  ecosystem  goods  and 
services. In this case, erosion protection services can be directly replaced by alternative investments (e.g., protection 
walls, terracing).  

The  substitute  cost  method  is  applied  by  estimating  the  costs  of  providing  a  substitute  for  the  affected  goods  and 
services. Thus, the cost of building and maintaining such protection measures is estimated. It must be also determined 
whether people would be willing to accept the alternative protection measures in place of a restored forest. 

5.3.1.2.3 

Strengths and weaknesses of the cost based methods 

Strengths of the cost based methods  

  The methods may provide a rough indicator of economic value, subject to data constraints and the degree of 

 

 

similarity or substitutability between related goods. 
It is easier to measure the costs of producing benefits than the benefits themselves, when goods, services, 
and benefits are non-marketed. Thus, these methods are less data- and resource-intensive. 
It provide surrogate measures of value that are as consistent with the economic concept of use value, for 
goods or services which may be difficult to value by other means. 

Weaknesses of the cost based methods  

  These methods assume that expenditures to repair damages or to replace ecosystem goods and services are 
valid  measures  of  the  benefits  provided.  However,  costs  are  usually  not  an  accurate  measure  of  benefits, 
which should be measured by peoples WTP. 

57 

 

 

  These methods do not consider social preferences for ecosystem services, or behaviour of individuals in the 

absence of those services.  

  The  methods  may  be  inconsistent  because  few  environmental  actions  and  regulations  are  based  solely  on 
benefit-cost  comparisons,  particularly  at  the  national  level.  Therefore,  the  cost  of  a  protective  action  may 
actually exceed the benefits to society. It is also likely that the cost of actions already taken to protect an 
ecological resource will underestimate the benefits of a new action to improve or protect the resource. 

  The replacement cost method requires information on the degree of substitution between the market good 
or service and the natural resource. Few environmental resources have such direct or indirect substitutes. 
Substitute goods or services are unlikely to provide the same types of benefits as the natural resource. 

  The goods or services being replaced probably represent only a portion of the full range of services provided 
by the natural resource. Thus, the benefits of an action to protect or restore the ecological resource would 
be understated. 

  These  methods  should  be  used  only  after  a  project  has  been  implemented  or  if  society  has  demonstrated 
their WTP for the project in some other way (e.g., approved spending for the project). Otherwise there is 
no  indication  that  the  value  of  the  good  or  service  provided  by  the  ecological  resource  to  the  affected 
community greater than the estimated cost of the project. 

  Without  evidence  that  the  public  would  demand  the  alternative,  these  methods  are  not  an  economically 
appropriate estimator of ecosystem good or service value. Nevertheless, in the absence of other valuation 
alternatives (e.g., lack of resources or expertise) the cost based methods are still often applied. 

5.3.1.2.4  Application of cost based methods 

In the EU (e.g., Ciancio and al., 2007; EU, 2005), cost based methods are commonly used by the public administrations 
to  realize  CBA,  economical  assessment  of  environmental  policies  and  projects,  etc.,  as  the  application  of  these 
methods is less demanding and the estimates are relatively robust (e.g., the prices for damage avoidance measures are 
stable). However, in most Mediterranean countries the application of these methods is still rather exceptional and only 
used in pilot or research studies (e.g., Merlo and Croitoru, 2005; Daly and al., 2012). 

Some examples of cases where these methods might be applied include: 

  Valuing improved water quality by measuring the cost of controlling effluent emissions; 
  Valuing  erosion  protection  services  of  a  forest  or  wetland  by  measuring  the  cost  of  removing  eroded 

sediment from downstream areas; 

  Valuing  the  water  purification  services  by  different  ecosystems  by  measuring  the  cost  of  filtering  and 

chemically treating water; 

  Valuing storm protection services by measuring the cost of building retaining walls; 
  Valuing habitat and nursery services by measuring the cost of breeding and stocking programs. 

For illustrating the application of the cost based methods, a study conducted by Jorio (2011) was used. The study is 
aiming at the estimation of the total economic value of goods and services provided by the Tazekka national park, and 
it includes different types of goods and services and different valuation techniques. In the following example only the 
substitute cost method will be considered. 

The Tazekka national park is located in the Middle Atlas, near the city of Taza, in Morocco. The park was created to 
protect the natural resources, particularly the cedar grove (Cedrus atlantica). With a surface of 13,730 ha it embarks a 
great variety of fauna and flora. The park provides a wide range of ecosystem goods and services as it contributes to 
the local economic development, (e.g., income from tourism, agricultural and forest products).  

The ecosystem goods and services provided by the Park were grouped into:  

 
 

Economic: agricultural production, forest products, fodder, water provision;  
Ecological: soil conservation, water reserves and quality, carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation; 

58 

 

 

 

Social: recreation, tourism, cultural, education, and spiritual. 

The forest fodder production value was estimated by using the substitute cost method. The quantities of the forest 
fodder and costs of substituting it by barley were estimated. Using this approach (see table 5.3) it was estimated that 
11,006 ha of forests provide approximately 4 million fodder units. Considering the market price for barely of 0.315 
8/kg , the total economic value obtained for the fodder production was 1.26 million euros.  

Further, the authors also considered the degradation caused by overgrazing, for which they assessed a cost of 32.58 
/ha (table 5.3). Reducing the total benefit of fodder provision by the cost of overgrazing the total benefit of fodder 
production was estimated at 902,775  or approximately 82  per ha.

5.3.1.3  Hedonic pricing method 

5.3.1.3.1  General  

The  hedonic  pricing  method  (HP)  relies  on  market  transactions  for  differentiated  goods  to  estimate  the  economic 
benefits  or  costs  associated  with  environmental  quality,  including  air  pollution,  water  pollution,  noise  and 
environmental amenities, such as aesthetic views (Paterson and Boyle, 2002), and proximity to recreational sites. It is 
most commonly applied to variations in housing prices that reflect the value of local environmental attributes (Taylor, 
2003). As a consequence, this method is suitable for investigating the influence of forest view or forest proximity in 
the price of a house. The theoretical framework for the HP method was developed by Rosen (1974). 

The  basic  premise  of  the  HP  method  is  that  the  price  of  a  marketed  good  is  related  to  its  characteristics,  or  the 
services it provides. For example, the price of a house reflects its characteristics, such as the number of bedrooms and 
size of the house, as well as the external characteristics, either in terms of proximity to services (i.e., school, hospital, 
etc.) or proximity to environmental amenities (i.e., park, lake, forest, etc.). The individual characteristics of a house, or 
other good, can therefore be valued by investigating how much people are willing to pay for its changes.

where  the  dependent  variable  (P)  is  the  sales  price  of  a  property  and  the  independent  variables  are  the  structural 
characteristics  (x=x1,  x2,  xn),  the  environmental  characteristics  of  the  commodity  (z=z1,  z2,  zm)  and  the  regression 
parameters (1, 1...n). 

As  such,  HP  is  an  indirect  valuation  method,  because  the value  people  place  on  the  characteristics  is  derived  from 
observable market transactions, rather than making a straightforward estimate.

5.3.1.3.2  Main steps in the application of the hedonic pricing method 

The following steps are followed to estimate the HP function: 

Step 1: Collection of data on property value and attributes, and environmental quality attributes 
The goal is to estimate a hedonic price function in order to calculate implicit prices, which are the marginal WTP for 
the evaluated attributes of the property. Thus, property values (the dependent variable) and property attributes and 
environmental  quality  characteristics  for  the  independent  variables  are  needed.  In  collecting  the  data  the  following 
issues should be taken into account: sources, selection and potential biases.  
 
For property values market prices are usually taken, but values assessed by homeowners or tax authorities can also be 
cautiously taken into account. Availability and reliability of data within the country is a crucial issue. In some countries, 
the data may be not entirely reliable as the recorded sales price might be underestimated to avoid the payment of 
higher property taxes. Therefore, direct surveys are preferred. Data collected by private firms are sometimes available 
upon sale. Homeowners can be asked within specific surveys to provide the price they paid to purchase their property 
along with the year of the sale and attributes of the house. Although these data may differ from the market sales, they 
can be considered a reasonably good approximation.  

Broadly  speaking,  data  that  can  be  used  as  independent  variables  are  property  characteristics,  neighbourhood 
characteristics and environmental quality characteristics. 

Data on property characteristics may include the size of the plot (typically measured in hectares or acres), size of the 
building,  the  number  of  bedrooms  and  bathrooms  (typically  measured  in  squared  metres  or  feet),  and  age  of  the 
structures. For apartments, other components such as floor level, the presence of a lift, the presence of a garage or 
parking  place  may  play  a  crucial  role.  Data  are  generally  gathered  from  records  of  tax  authorities  or  homeowner 
surveys. 

Neighbourhood characteristics deal with quality and location. The first group often includes the quality of local school, 
level  of  crime,  average  income,  average  age  and  ethnic  composition.  These  data  are  usually  available  from  the 
government census. Location characteristics deal with distance to the town centre, nearest shopping centres, distance 
to train station, nearest light rail or bus stop, nearest motorway exit. 

Environmental characteristics also deal with quality and location. Environmental amenities include the quality of the air 
(pollution level) or the clarity of the water of the lake close to the property. Scientific measures of these variables are 
typically  used.  Information  about  the  location  include:  distance  to  an  open  space,  a  forest,  a  public  park,  a  lake,  a 
landfill, a quarry. These are usually measured in kilometres and obtained through a GIS software package. 

Step 2: Sampling 
Before sampling the size of area and the period for which the data is collected have to be considered. 

The size of the sampling area is crucial, because to get a more reliable estimation of the regression parameters (also 
see  next  step)  enough  variation  in  environmental  characteristic  is  needed.  It  seems  easier  to  allow  for  variation  in 
location (e.g., distance to a nice forest) then for quality variation (e.g., level of water quality). The geographical area of 
the properties could involve more than one market. Although each urban area can be considered as a single market, 
there may be market segmentation within the same area, due to social aspects or product heterogeneity. 

Also  the  considered  time  period  should  be  long  enough  to  guarantee  enough  variation  in  market  conditions.  For 
example, the effect of an improved environmental characteristic can be very strongly reflected in the housing price just 
after the improvement happened, but will decrease over time.  However, when considering longer time periods also 
the inflation rate should be taken into account. Thus, in the regression model variables are used that represent (see 
next step) a price index (e.g., relative prices with reference to a selected base year) or the year of the house sale.

Step 3: Model estimation and welfare estimates 
Once the data is collected and compiled, the next step is to statistically estimate a function that relates property values 
to the property characteristics, including the distance to open space. The resulting function measures the portion of 
the property price that is attributable to each characteristic.  

The choice of the functional form is a crucial issue as it can substantially impact results. As the price is determined at 
market equilibrium by buyers and sellers, there is no specific rule to follow in choosing the functional form. The most 
common functional forms are (Table 5.4) linear, semi-log, double-log, quadratic, and quadratic Box-Cox. There is no 
general rule how to select the functional form, as the dependent variable (e.g., house price) is formed on the market 
by buyers and sellers, and it does not follow any specific rule.

In  the  linear  functional  form  the  implicit  price  for  any  specific  attribute  (structural  or  property  characteristics, 
neighbourhood  issues  and  environmental  attributes)  is  simply  the  estimated  coefficient.  Implicit  prices9 differ  across 
attributes, but are constant within each attribute. Linear functional forms should be avoided, because of their inability 
to allow for incremental changes.  

The  impact  of  each  functional  form  on  the  results  is  very  different  and  it  is  related  to  the  specific  dataset.  Implicit 
prices provide information about the possible capitalization of an environmental characteristic on the market. They do 
not express the value placed by consumers on a discrete change in the environmental characteristics.  

5.3.1.3.3 

Strengths and weaknesses of the hedonic pricing method 

Strengths of the hedonic pricing method: 

  The main strength is that it can be used to estimate values based on actual choices. 
 

Property  markets  are  relatively  efficient  in  responding  to  information,  so  they  can  be  good  indications  of 
value. 

  The method is versatile, and can be adapted to consider several possible interactions between market goods 

and environmental quality. 
Property records are typically very reliable. 

 

                                                        

9 Implicit price is not showed or reported as a separate price of a good or service, but forms only part of the 
overall price of a good or service. 

 

61 

 

Weaknesses of the hedonic pricing method: 

  The scope of environmental benefits that can be measured is limited to things that  are related to housing 

prices. 

  The method will only capture WTP of people for perceived differences in environmental attributes, and their 
direct consequences. Thus, if people are not aware of the linkages between the environmental attribute and 
benefits to them or their property, the value will not be reflected in home prices. 

  The  method  assumes  that  people  have  the  opportunity  to  select  the  combination  of  features  they  prefer, 
given their income.  However, the housing market may be affected by outside influences, like taxes, interest 
rates, or other factors. 

Large amounts of data must be gathered and manipulated. 

  The results depend heavily on model specification. 
 
  The method is relatively complex to implement and interpret, requiring a high degree of statistical expertise.  
  The time and expense to carry out an application depends on the availability and accessibility of data. 

5.3.1.3.4  Application of the hedonic pricing method 

The hedonic pricing method is mainly used to estimate economic values for benefits or costs associated with: 

 
 

Environmental quality, including air pollution, water pollution, or noise; 
Environmental amenities, such as aesthetic views or proximity to recreational sites. 

It is most commonly applied to variations in housing prices that reflect the value of local environmental attributes, for 
instance, living near a green area or a lake. 

In Europe and Mediterranean region, it exists very few hedonic pricing applications. Partly this is because of its limited 
scope, but mainly due to the difficulty to obtain reliable data for housing. For example, Le Goffe (2002) applies the 
hedonic pricing, using rental prices for rural cottages, to estimate the effects of agricultural and forestry activities on 
tourism income and public welfare. Lovric (2009) used house prices in Zagreb (Croatia) to estimate the value of urban 
forests. 

Given the absence of the applications of this method in the Mediterranean countries the work conducted by Tyrvainen 
(1997) was selected to show its use. In the selected study it was explored whether and how urban forests benefits are 
capitalized  in  property  prices  in  Joensuu  (Finland).  As  the  dependent  variable  real  estate  prices  (/m2)10 from  14 
different  housing  areas  (a  total  of  1006  observations)  and  as  independent  variables  different  housing  characteristics 
(table 5.5) were used.

converted to euros using an exchange rate 1 FIM =0.168

The  author  applied  a  linear  and  semi-log  regression  models  to  estimate  the  impact  on  housing,  location  and 
environmental  characteristics  on  the  housing  price.  The  obtained  results  indicate  that  the  proximity  to  different 
environmental amenities positively affects housing prices. For example, a 100 m increase in distance to a watercourse 
decreased the housing price by 25.9 /m2. In the same way, an 100 m increase of distance to forest recreation site 
decreases the housing price by 7.06 /m2 (figure 5.6).

5.3.1.4  Travel cost method 

5.3.1.4.1  General  

The travel cost method (TC) uses the cost of travel, observed site characteristics and observed trip patterns to value 
the characteristics, or existence, of a site-specific environmental amenity (for example, how much they spent to arrive 
and stay at their destination (e.g., forest) for the entire length of their visit). To do this, the TC method estimates use 
values for site-specific amenities, particularly use values that can only be obtained by visiting a site. Its use requires that 
out of pocket expenses do occur and that they vary across users. The method is typically applied to value recreational, 
scenic and cultural destinations.  

Typically, a demand of an individual for trips to a site is modelled as a function of the cost of a trip to the site, the cost 
of visiting substitute sites, the characteristics of the site, the characteristics of its substitutes, income and other non-

 

63 

 

financial  demographic  characteristics  of  the  respondent.  The  number  of  trips  should  decrease  as  the  cost  of  a  visit 
increases and should increase as the quality of the site increases. The initial idea was developed by Hotelling (1947) 
and later implemented by Clawson and Knetsch (1966). 

If the focus is on a single site, then the model which most likely is going to be used is based on a demand function: 

(cid:1872)(cid:3041)(cid:3037)(cid:3404)(cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:1855)(cid:3047),(cid:1855)(cid:3046),(cid:1877),(cid:1878)(cid:4667) 

where t is the number of visits made by an individual n to a site j during a season, ct is the trip cost to the site, cs is a 
vector of trip costs to reach other substitute sites, y is income and z is a vector of socio-economic variables. 

There are several varieties of the travel cost method (King and Mazzotta, 2000): 

 

A simple zonal travel cost method, using mostly secondary data (e.g., visitor statistics), with some simple data 
collected  from  visitors:  this  is  the  simplest  and  least  expensive  approach.  It  will  estimate  a  value  for 
recreational services of the site as a whole. It cannot easily be used to value a change in quality of recreation 
for a site, and may not consider some of the factors that may be important determinants of value. The zonal 
travel  cost  method  is  applied  by  collecting  information  on  the  number  of  visits  to  the  site  from  different 
distances.  Because  the  travel  and  time  costs  will  increase  with  distance,  this  information  allows  the 
researcher  to  calculate  the  number  of  visits  purchased  at  different  prices.  This  information  is  used  to 
construct the demand function for the site, and estimate the economic benefits, for the recreational services 
of the site. 

  An  individual travel cost method,  using  a  more  detailed  survey  of  visitors:  is  similar  to  the  zonal  travel  cost 
method,  but  uses  survey  data  from  individual  visitors  in  the  statistical  analysis,  rather  than  data  from  each 
zone. This method thus requires more data  collection and  slightly more complicated analysis, but will give 
more precise results. This method requires the implementation of a visitor survey. 

  A random utility travel cost method using survey and other data, and more complicated statistical techniques: 
this is the most complicated and expensive of the travel cost methods. It is also the most recent, and allows 
much more flexibility in calculating benefits. It is the best way to estimate benefits for specific characteristics, 
or quality changes, of sites, rather than for the site as a whole. It is also the most appropriate when there are 
many substitute sites. The random utility travel cost method assumes that individuals will pick the site that 
they prefer, out of all possible sites. Individuals make trade-offs between site quality and the price of travel to 
the site. Hence, this model requires information on all possible sites that a visitor might select, their quality 
characteristics, and the travel costs to each site. 

These approaches differ in the way the variables are defined and measured, on the specification of the model, on the 
estimation procedures employed and in the computation of consumer surplus. Moreover, if the aim is to value changes 
in the characteristics of different sites simultaneously, an appropriate model which handles multiple-sites needs to be 
specified. As a consequence, some preliminary decisions need to be taken before the study begins. 

Firstly, it is important to define what the exact purpose of the study is. TC models can be used to value access to sites, 
i.e., the welfare effects of the elimination of a recreational site, or to value the characteristics of a site, i.e., a change in 
the  level  of  the  quality  of  the site.  Models  differ depending on  the  goal  of  the  study, such  as  estimating  the  loss  of 
welfare due to a change in land use from public to commercial, or the closure of the site to public access.  

Secondly, TC models are commonly used to estimate benefit changes due to the implementation of an environmental 
policy which aims, for example, at decreasing the level of water pollution in a lake or extending the number and/or 
length of hiking trails in a forest. More generally, it might be interesting to value changes in site attributes considering a 
set of recreation sites; or to determine how the variation in the site quality affects the probability of choosing one site 
over another. 

5.3.1.4.2  Main steps in the application of the travel cost method 

Although  travel  cost  method  approaches  are  quite  different,  they  share  a  similar  pattern  of  estimation  in  terms  of 
operative steps (Riera and Signorello, 2012). 

 

64 

 

Step 1: Definition of the site  
One issue is the definition of the boundaries of the site to be valued. In some cases (e.g., urban forest, national park) 
boundaries are easy to identify, while in others this may be more difficult (e.g., hunting area). Forests might not have 
particular problems in defining the boundaries, depending on the area where they are located.  

Step 2: Definition of the target population 
The population of interest are the users and potential users of the sites. People visiting the site may take a day-trip or 
stay overnight. This is one of the main issues with travel cost, because trips to the site should be of the same length 
for  each  person.  It  is  preferable  not  to  mix  one  day  and  two  or  more  day  trips  in  the  same  analysis  (Haab  and 
McConnell, 2002). Most common is to use day-trip data, overnight trips can be used, but less common. 

For geographical area of relevance, Parsons (2003) suggests to define boundaries in terms of one day of driving.  

A related issue is sites having multiple recreation uses. This might be the case of a forest, where people would go for 
short walks, hiking, picnicking, mushroom picking, bird-watching, hunting, just resting, etc. One solution might be to 
aggregate similar recreation activities, in order to simplify data collection and analysis, even if great care must be taken. 
Another solution is to identify the primary purpose of a recreation trip and ask respondents to report the number of 
trips taken according to several purposes. Nevertheless, there are also studies (e.g., Yeh and al. 2006) that account for 
multiple activities in different sites by specifying utility functions that allow activities to enter in a separable way. This is 
particularly useful when sites with similar attributes support a similar set of activities (Bowman and al., 2007). 

People may visit other recreation sites nearby or visit friends or do something else besides the main purpose of the 
trip.  The  problem  is  the  treatment  of  expenses,  since  they  appear  to  be  no  longer  attributable  only  to  the  main 
recreation experience.  

The  cost  allocation  to  different  purposes  is  generally  not  feasible,  or  at  least  quite  complicated.  Day-trip  data  are 
usually reasonably assumed to be single-purpose, whereas it is more difficult with overnight data. A general solution is 
to drop multipurpose trips from the dataset or to treat them separately.  

Step 3: Definition of the sampling strategy 
Sampling strategies depend on the aim of the study, the population of interest and the type of model. Both users and 
potential users should be taken into account. Within on-site sampling, commonly used in single-site models, visitors 
are surveyed at the site. The advantage is that the sample size can be smaller. Nonetheless, respondents with zero 
trips will not be considered, partly biasing the demand function, and, if not corrected, the welfare estimates (Parsons, 
2003). It is easier to sample sites with clear entry points and this may not be the case with forests.  

In off-site sampling respondents are sampled from the general population, thus by allowing both users and non-users to 
be contacted. Most of the biases described above can be avoided. On the other hand, off-site samples can be costly 
due to the low participation rate. 

Step 4: Survey implementation  
Adequate survey methodology is crucial. The introduction is particularly relevant to explain the purpose of the study. 
Some easy questions make the respondent familiar with the issue of the survey. Relevant issues in the questionnaire 
are:  a)  a  detailed  description  of  the  valued  area,  b)  potential  problems  affecting  the  place  (e.g.,  congestion,  lack  of 
services),  c)  a  short  list  of  amenities  (e.g.,  presence  of  specific  trees  in  a  forest).  Potential  effects  of  environmental 
policies should also be described. 

A specific section should focus on costs and trips, by explicitly asking questions on the number of trips taken to the 
site(s) over a specific period of time. Ideally, information should be collected for each trip taken to the sites, in practice 
this is impossible, so information concern the last trips to the sites. 

Step 5: Calculation of travel costs and other costs 
Although there is no fixed answer, which costs should be considered, the general agreement is to sum the day trip 
expenditures, typically transportation cost, access fee and time cost. 

 

65 

 

Costs can be explicitly asked to respondents or computed by the researcher (e.g., using travel software (e.g., Google 
maps) to calculate the distance and then multiplying with average cost per kilometre). The latter case, which is the 
most common, would ensure more uniform data and avoid missing data of respondents. 

Costs of travel usually include all transit expenses. Specifically, when most of the visits are made by car, round-trip 
costs include fuel, upkeep and tolls. Software package can be of help in calculating the distance and the related figures 
of cost. It is important to know the number of people sharing a car in order to correctly compute the travel cost per 
person. 

Entrance fees have to be included in the trip cost if a fee is paid to visit a recreation area. This might be the case in a 
protected area or a park. 

Equipment costs might be also considered. They may differ quite a lot depending on the type of recreation activity 
practiced. For example, activities that can be practiced in a forest and the related equipment, such as the hunters gun 
or the biking equipment for mountain biking. Equipment costs are difficult to estimate and are usually not computed. 

One of the most discussed and crucial issue is probably the estimation of the opportunity cost of time associated to 
the  trip.  If  the  value  of  travel  time  is  not  considered  it  may  affect  the  travel  costs  and  subsequently  the  welfare 
measures, which may be underestimated. One needs to deal with the value of opportunities lost while spending time 
reaching the site, staying there and returning home. Since the cost of time is generally related to a persons income, 
the estimation of the time cost is commonly derived by multiplying the hourly wage by the travel time to the site.  

Step 6: Model estimation and welfare estimates  
The choice of the model is strictly associated to the data and the aim of the estimation.  

Single-site travel cost regression models 

Regression  models  for  count  data  are  mostly  used  for  single-site  applications  of  TC,  for  two  reasons:  first,  the 
dependent variable (number of trips) is nonnegative and integer and second, there is a significant fraction of people 
taking zero or small number of trips. The Poisson regression, which is the basic specification, estimates the probability 
(Pr) of observing an individual take t trips during a selected period of time: 

Pr(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)exp	(cid:4666)(cid:3398)(cid:2019)(cid:4667)(cid:2019)(cid:3047)
(cid:1872)!
(cid:2019)(cid:3404)(cid:2009)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:1846)(cid:1829) 

where the parameter (cid:2019) is the expected number of trips and is assumed to be a function of the variables specified in the 
where the number of trips ((cid:2019)) is a function of travel costs (TC), and (cid:2009) and (cid:2010) are regression parameters. 

demand model. A very simple version of such a function would be: 

 

The Poisson model is characterized by a strong assumption that the chance of making a trip is randomly distributed 
and  all  individuals  have  an  equal  chance  of  making  the  same  number  of  trips.  However,  this  assumption  may  be 
incorrect: it can be observed that relatively more people make a higher number of trips than the model predicts. The 
negative binomial model and the generalized negative binomial model are variations of the Poisson model, but relaxing 
this constraint.  

Consumer surplus (CS) estimates can be expressed in several ways: as a mean seasonal value per person, as a total 
seasonal value for the population and as an average per trip per person. The average per trip per person value based 
on the Poisson regression model is: 

where CS is the consumer surplus (benefit) per trip and (cid:2010) is the regression parameter associated to travel costs (TC).

Random utility travel cost regression models 

The basic random utility model is a multinomial logit regression model (MNL), which states that the probability (Pr) of 
visiting a selected site j depends on the attributes of that site and the attributes of all the other sites within the choice 
set:  

As an example, the welfare loss expressed as per choice occasion due to the closure of other three forests is:  

Pr(cid:4666)(cid:1862)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)
(cid:3030)(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2872)

(cid:1829)(cid:1845)(cid:3041)(cid:3404)(cid:1864)(cid:1866)(cid:3419)exp(cid:4666)(cid:2009)(cid:3548)(cid:2868)(cid:3397)(cid:2009)(cid:3548)(cid:2869)(cid:1863)(cid:4667)(cid:3397) exp	(cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3030)(cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3043)(cid:1868)(cid:3036)(cid:4667)

exp	(cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:3030)(cid:1855)(cid:3037)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:3043)(cid:1868)(cid:3037)(cid:4667)
(cid:3030)(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
(cid:3423)(cid:3398)(cid:1864)(cid:1866)(cid:3419)exp(cid:4666)(cid:2009)(cid:3548)(cid:2868)(cid:3397)(cid:2009)(cid:3548)(cid:2869)(cid:1863)(cid:4667)(cid:3397) exp	(cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3030)(cid:1855)(cid:3036)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:4632)(cid:3043)(cid:1868)(cid:3036)(cid:4667)

For the estimation of a multi-site model, also other more complex models can be used (e.g., nested logit, mixed logit). 
The advantage of these more complex models is their ability to overcome some strong restrictions associated with the 
MNL model. The most common restriction is the independence of irrelevant alternative (IIA), which implies that the 
probability of choosing between two sites is not influenced by modifications involving other sites of the choice set. It 
means that a decrease in a quality attribute of a forest site would induce a proportional increase in the probability of 
visiting all the other sites, by suggesting that all other forests are good substitutes. 

5.3.1.4.3 

Strengths and weaknesses of the travel cost method 

Strengths of the travel cost method: 

  The travel cost method closely simulates the more conventional empirical techniques used by economists to 

estimate economic values based on market prices. 

  The method is based on actual behaviourwhat people actually dorather than stated WTPwhat people 

say they would do in a hypothetical situation. 

  On-site surveys provide opportunities for large sample sizes, as visitors tend to be interested in participating. 
  The results are relatively easy to interpret and explain. 
  The method is relatively inexpensive to apply. 

Weaknesses of the travel cost method: 

  The travel cost method assumes that people perceive and respond to changes in travel costs the same way 

that they would respond to changes in admission price. 

  The travel cost method is limited in its scope of application because it requires user participation. It cannot 
be used to assign values to on-site environmental features and functions that users of the site do not find 
valuable. It cannot be used to value off-site values supported by the site. Most importantly, it cannot be used 
to  measure  non-use  values.  Thus,  sites  that  have  unique  qualities  that  are  valued  by  non-users  will  be 
undervalued. 
Standard travel cost method approaches provides information about current conditions, but not about gains 
or losses from anticipated changes in resource conditions. 

 

  The simplest models assume that individuals take a trip for a single purpose to visit a specific recreational site. 
Thus, if a trip has more than one purpose, the value of the site may be overestimated. It can be difficult to 
apportion the travel costs among the various purposes.  

  The availability of substitute sites will affect values. For example, if two people travel the same distance, they 
are assumed to have the same value. However, if one person has several substitutes available but travels to 
this site because it is preferred, this persons value is actually higher. Some of the more complicated models 
account for the availability of substitutes. 

  Those who value certain sites may choose to live nearby. If this is the case, they will have low travel costs, 

but high values for the site that are not captured by the method. 
Interviewing visitors on site can introduce sampling biases to the analysis. 

 
  Measuring recreational quality and relating recreational quality to environmental quality can be difficult. 
  Defining and measuring the opportunity cost of time, or the value of time spent traveling, can be problematic. 
Because the time spent travelling could have been used in other ways, it has an opportunity cost. This should 

67 

 

 

be  added  to  the  travel  cost,  or  the  value  of  the  site  will  be  underestimated.  However,  there  is  no  strong 
consensus on the appropriate measure - the wage rate of a person, or some fraction of the wage rate - and 
the value chosen can have a large effect on benefit estimates. In addition, if people enjoy the travel itself, then 
travel time becomes a benefit, not a cost, and the value of the site will be overestimated.  
In order to estimate the demand function, there needs to be enough difference between distances travelled 
to affect travel costs and for differences in travel costs to affect the number of trips made. Thus, it is not well 
suited  for  sites  near  main  population  centres  where  many  visitations  may  be  from  "origin  zones"  that  are 
quite close to one another. 

 

  As  in  all  statistical  methods,  certain  statistical  problems  can  affect  the results. These  include  choice  of  the 
functional form used to estimate the demand curve, choice of the estimating method, and choice of variables 
included in the model. 

5.3.1.4.4  Application of the travel cost method 

The travel cost method is used to estimate the value of recreational benefits generated by ecosystems. It assumes that 
the value of the site or its recreational services is reflected in how much people are willing to pay to get there. The 
travel cost method can be used to estimate the economic benefits or costs resulting from: 

Elimination of an existing recreational site; 

  Changes in access costs for a recreational site; 
 
  Addition of a new recreational site; 
  Changes in environmental quality at a recreational site. 

The TC method for valuing forest goods and services has been relatively frequently used in the Mediterranean area, at 
least,  since  the  middle  of  the  1990  decade.  Examples  of  applications  are,  studies  in  Tunisia  (Daly  and  al.,  2012), 
Morocco (Jorio, 2011), France (Scherrer, 2003), Spain (Riera and al., 1995; Caparros and Campos, 2002; Bujosa and 
Riera,  2008),  and  Italy  (Tempesta  and  al.,  2002).  The  TC  method  is  mainly  used  for  valuing  direct  use  recreational 
forest services, such as picnicking, tourism, sports (Bujosa and Riera, 2008; Jorio, 2011; Daly and al., 2012; ), cultural 
and spiritual events (Jorio, 2011), as well as non-use services as biodiversity or landscape values (Bujosa & Riera, 2008). 
When the main objective is not commercial, certain uses of forests such as mushroom picking may be included within 
the use recreational services, as their principal component can be enjoying the forest by itself (Martinez de Aragon and 
al., 2011). 

For illustrating the application of TC method, an application of the method by Martinez de Aragon and al. (2011) was 
used. In this paper the authors apply an individual TC method to estimate the benefits of mushroom picking in a rural 
Mediterranean area. The data were obtained through a sample of 300 mushroom pickers in the forests of the Solsones 
County in Catalonia (North East Spain). To estimate the pickers benefits obtained from mushroom picking data were 
collected about attitudes of the respondent and mycological knowledge, expenses incurred during the trips, frequency 
of trips, amount of collected mushrooms and socioeconomic data of the respondent (for details see table 5.6).

Table 5.7 summarises the results obtained from the econometric estimation of the Poisson model. The cost of the trip 
(TC)  was  negatively  related  to  the  number  of  trips.  Knowing  more  mushroom  species  (Species)  and  expecting  to 
collect  more  mushrooms  (Quantity)  increased  the  probability  of  making  more  trips.  The  same  was  found  for  Age, 
suggesting that younger people are not so frequently going on mushroom trips as older persons.

The benefit (consumer surplus) of an additional trip to pick mushrooms in Solsones County was calculated according 

The estimated consumer surplus was 1/ 0.0255 = 39.26 /trip. The authors reported that a total of 18,000 where 
counted  mushroom  picking  season.  Thus,  the  total  consumer  surplus  was  about  710,000  per  mushroom  picking 
season. The consumer surplus has two components, as individuals base their decisions on the recreational experience 
they obtain, as well as the products they expect to collect. To estimate the recreational surplus, the value of collected 
mushrooms was deducted from the total surplus. The product value was estimated by the earnings an individual would 
obtain in the market by selling the amount of mushrooms harvested at the market price. The average market value of 
the collected mushrooms per trip was about 7.00 . Thus, the recreational surplus was estimated at 32.43 /trip or 
about 586,000 /season.  

5.3.2  Stated preference methods 

Stated  preference  (SP)  methods  use  surveys  to  simulate  a  hypothetical  market  for  the  goods  or  services  at  stake. 
These surveys aim at eliciting individual preferences and obtaining directly or indirectly monetary valuations from the 
respondents.  These  valuations  are  commonly  referred  to  as  WTP  or  alternatively  (and  less  commonly  used) 
willingness to accept (WTA). The main advantage of these methods is that they can be applied for valuation of use and 
non-use values (Riera and al., 2012), while the RP methods are mostly limited to use values.  

SP methods are generally grouped into two categories: contingent valuation (CV) method and the choice modelling 
(CM) family of methods. In CV questionnaires, people are presented with a hypothetical change in the provision of a 
goods  and/or  services  and  are  asked  to  state  their  WTP  (or  WTA).  Whereas  in  a  typical  CM  questionnaire 
respondents are faced with several alternatives and are (in most cases) asked to pick their most preferred alternative 
(Riera and al., 2012); this variant of CM is known as choice experiment (CE).  

Because in forest related studies the CE is the most widely used method within the CM family, this section will focus 
on the description of the CE method. Choosing between CV and CE depends on several criteria, such as the study aim 
and  the  nature  of  the  change  to  be  valued.  When  the  change  is  multi-dimensional  and  affects  several  goods  and 
services then CE is preferred.  

 

69 

 

CV is a relevant method for the valuation of forest goods and services, as the forest ecosystems provide goods and 
services in bundles that cannot easily be split into separate characteristics or attributes11. In fact, it constitutes a suitable 
tool when valuing forest components that work, move and behave all at the same time. Therefore, the CV leads to a 
more  holistic  approach  than  CE  that  focuses  on  single  components  (Kramer  and  al.,  2004).  However,  the  CV  only 
provides a single WTP (WTA) estimate for the complete change, while the CE delivers marginal WTP (WTA) for each 
of the components. 

In  the  CV  method,  the  term  contingent  suggests  that  the  results  are  dependent  on  the  simulated  hypothetical 
market for the good or service in question.  

CE method focuses on the value of a number of attributes relevant for policy design or forest management (Holmes 
and  Boyle,  2004)  rather  than  focusing  on  the  total  (holistic)  value  of  the  forest  ecosystems.  This  approach  is  best 
suited for management decisions that are concerned with changing attribute levels rather than estimating the overall 
change in the provision of environmental goods and services (Hanley and al., 2001b).  

In  a  CE  method  ecosystem  goods  and  services  are  characterised  in  terms  of  a  number  and  levels  of  its  attributes. 
These  attributes  are  then  combined  into  hypothetical  scenarios  (also  called  alternatives)  and  these  alternatives  are 
then combined into choice sets. In a typical choice set one of the alternatives represents the current situation, showing 
the  current  level  of  the  various  attributes  without  any  additional  cost,  while  other  alternatives  represent  other 
possible scenarios in terms of attribute levels and costs (see Figure 5.7 below) (Bennet and Adamowicz, 2001).  

These  choice  sets  are  then  shown  to  respondents  in  a  non-random  manner.  Respondents  are  asked  to  choose, 
amongst the offered alternatives, their preferred one.  

Thus, when respondents make their choice, they implicitly make trade-offs between the levels of the attributes of the 
different  alternatives  presented  in  a  choice  set  (Alpizar  and  al.,  2003).  Given  that,  one  of  the  attributes  represents 
monetary cost, it is possible to estimate how much people are willing to pay to achieve a certain level of an attribute. 
Furthermore, it is possible to use the results to infer the amounts people are willing to pay to move from the current 
situation of attribute levels to a specific alternative.   

5.3.2.1  Main steps in the application of SP methods 

The main steps in applying SP valuation methods are (Riera and Signorello, 2012):  

Step 1: Definition of the valuation objective 
The first step is to clearly define the valuation objective. This includes determining which goods or services should be 
valued and why this valuation is necessary. The objective is to clearly specify the valuation question and the marginal 
changes to be valued. For example, the valuation question could be What is the value individuals in region A put on 
an improvement of management in forest X, which would improve plant diversity; in this case the marginal change 
would be the additional plant species in forest X. 

If the valuation question entails valuing only the change of one good or service, then CV would be more suited, i.e., 
valuing  the  change  on  endangered  species.  On  the  contrary,  if  the  aim  is  to  value  changes  of  multiple  goods  and 
services (e.g., plant diversity, carbon sequestration, recreation access) then CE is better suited.  

Step 2: Selection of the survey type 
The selection of the survey type will depend on the target population (i.e., the size of the population that would be 
directly  or  indirectly  affected  by  the  valued  changes),  the  characteristics  of  the  sample,  types  of  questions,  topics 

                                                        

11 In economic  valuation  the characteristics of  a  given  ecosystem  or  good  or  service are  called  attributes. For 
example, biodiversity of a forest ecosystem could be described in terms of the number of mammals, plants and 
insects. Each of them would be one of the biodiversity attributes of this forest ecosystem.

included  in  the  valuation  survey,  the  expected  response  rate  and  moreover,  on  the  budget  and  time  available  to 
conduct the study. In continuation the most typical survey types are presented.  

Face to face surveys are the most costly and time consuming survey type. However, generally they provide the best 
data quality, as they facilitate the interaction with the respondents (e.g., during a face to face survey the respondent is 
more focused on answering the questions as this might be the cases in web-based surveys). They also allow presenting 
even more complex topics, and capturing preferences of people that in other survey types might not be included in the 
sampling (e.g., people with no phone or internet access).  

Mail surveys are in general less costly and allow the presentation of complex valuation topics (e.g., detailed instructions 
and  description  of  the  topics  can  be  provided  to  the  respondent),  but  require  more  time  and  mostly  result  in  low 
response rates (e.g., typically response rates vary between 5 and 50 %). 

Phone surveys are cheap and less time consuming. However, they are only adequate for simple questionnaires, where 
the  valuation  topic  is  well  known  to  the  respondents.  They  are  also  limiting  the  sample  to  individuals  with  phone 
access. Often phone surveys are combined with mail surveys (e.g., the respondent is contacted by phone and then the 
survey material is send via mail). 

Finally  web  questionnaires  are  relatively  cheap  and  fast.  However,  it  has  the  drawback  of  limiting  the  sampled 
population  only  to  those  with  internet  access,  which  can  differ  significantly  from  the  general  population  (e.g., 
respondents from older age groups (above 60 years) are underrepresented in this type of surveys).  

Step 3: Questionnaire elaboration 
SP methods are based on questionnaires. Thus, designing the valuation questionnaire is one of the most crucial steps 
on the path to accurate value estimates.  

First a draft valuation questionnaire is prepared. This already contains the description of the valuation topic (e.g., the 
current situation, possible changes, goods and services it will affect) and the valuation question. The valuation question 
has to be clear and credible, so that the respondents have no difficulties to understand it and that they also believe 
that the anticipated change is possible.  

The way the valuation question is presented will depend on the valuation method. If using the CV, the respondents are 
directly asked about their WTP or WTA. For example: 

This recreation forest is currently lacking young trees, due to intensive grazing. Would you be willing to pay a 2  entrance fee 
that would support the creation of fenced areas where the young trees would be better protected? 

In the case of a CE study, the respondents are asked a series of questions where they will have to select the most 
preferred alternative among a choice set (see example figure 5.7).

Figure 5.7: Example of valuation question in a CE questionnaire  

The typical questionnaire consists of several sections (Carson, 2000): 

  The first section is devoted to introduce the survey purpose, the context for making a decision. 
  The second section provides a clear and detailed description of the good or service to be valued. This section 
usually collects also data about previous knowledge of respondents and attitudes towards the good or service 
valued. 

  The third section presents the valuation scenarios including current or baseline situation (also denominated as 
the status quo) and possible future states of the ecosystem good or service in case of no change happens (e.g., 
no change in management is applied). 

  The forth section or elicitation section asks respondents maximum WTP to obtain the environmental good or 

service or minimum WTA for giving it up. 

  The fifth section analyses the respondents understanding and certainty of the answers provided. 
  The last section is devoted to collect some debriefing questions on socio-demographic characteristics of the 

respondents. 

The null alternative 

When creating a SP study, an important element to consider is what will happen if the project is not implemented. In 
other  words,  the  null  alternative  is  crucial.  This  element  helps  clarify  the  stakes  of  the  valuation  study.  The  null 
alternative  must  be  defined  clearly.  Its  definition  will  depend  on  the  context,  but  typically  refers  to  the  do-nothing 
situation explaining what will happen if the project is not implemented. The null alternative is frequently named also 
the status quo or business as usual situation. 

In the case of CV, a study may estimate the WTP for an improvement in environmental quality or quantity, or the 
WTA if this hypothetical improvement does not occur.

In  CE,  the  null  alternative  is  an  alternative  that  the  respondent  can  select  from  a  choice  set.  Each  choice  set,  or 
valuation question, typically consists of the reference situation and at least one alternative scenario, while the former 
remains identical to the valuation sequence (see figure 5.7). 

The payment vehicle 

In a SP valuation questionnaire, a hypothetical market is established, and individuals are asked to state their maximum 
WTP  or  WTA  for  a  given  environmental  change.  In  order  to  provide  a  meaningful  context  for  the  valuation, 
respondents are asked about their WTP or WTA through a payment vehicle. A payment vehicle defines the way how 
the amount of money the respondents are willing to pay would be collected. Taxes (e.g., income, property), service 
fees (e.g., water bill), entrance fees, and donations are some of the typical payment vehicles used in SP questionnaires.  

The  payment  vehicle  used  should  be  realistic  and  relevant.  For  example,  it  would  not  be  realistic  to  establish  an 
entrance fee to a forest, if there is currently an open access policy in place. Or it would not be relevant to ask about 
an increase in income tax, if the respondent does not pay income taxes, due to a lack of income.   

Payments could be expressed as total nominal amounts, as proportions of income or taxes. If the respondent is only 
supposed to pay part of the amount and the other part will be paid by another entity (e.g., public administration) the 
questionnaire should specify this. 

Depending  on  the  intended  use  of  the  value  estimates,  payments  could  be  made  periodical,  say  for  five  years,  or 
indefinitely, or on a one-time only basis. If periodical, or if the one-time payment, it must be clearly stated whether the 
value is expressed in nominal or real prices. Furthermore, it should be specified whether the payment refers to the 
household, or the respondent.  

Specific issues on questionnaire elaboration for CV 

One of the most crucial decisions in designing a CV questionnaire is the choice of the elicitation response format, as 
the information given to respondents through the elicitation format may influence their responses. Elicitation formats 
also differ in the amount of information conveyed to respondents, and also on the amount of information that can be 
collected from respondents. Overall, it is important to be aware that all elicitation formats influence the determined 
WTP in some way and could have a strong influence on the estimated welfare (Riera and Signorello, 2012).  

Some examples of elicitation formats are (Riera and Signorello, 2012):  

  Open-ended format: respondents are directly asked about their maximum WTP for changes in the provision of 
the  good  in  question.  It  is  very  informative  but  does  not  provide  respondents  with  clues  concerning  their 
potential  WTP.  Drawbacks  are  that  they  are  not  incentive  compatible  and  may  evoke  a  large  number  of 
zeros and outliers.  

  Discrete choice (DC) question format asks respondents whether they are willing to pay a certain amount of 
money for a specified change in the provision of a certain good. Respondents answer with yes or no. The 
bid  amount  is  varied  over  different  respondents.  The  main  advantage  is  that  it  is  incentive  compatible, 
although the information obtained per respondent is very limited (i.e. if only one DC question is asked during 
the  interview,  all  that  is  known  is  whether  the  respondents  WTP  is  higher  or  lower,  than  the  amount 
presented).  

 

  Double bound discrete choice: as in a bidding game, the respondents are presented with a second bid depending 
on their responses to the first bid. If to the first bid the respondents answers with no the second bid is 
lowered and increased when they answer to the first bid yes. Thus, it provides an interval for the WTP and 
therefore requires fewer interviews that the DC with only one question added.  
Bidding  game:  respondents  face  a  series  of  DC  questions.  Depending  on  their  responses,  subsequent 
responses present a lower or a higher bid, until the respondents agree to pay the offered amount or until 
they  are  not  willing  to  pay  the  higher  amount.  The  major  drawback  of  the  bidding  game  is  that  the  final 
estimate  may  strongly  depend  on  the  starting  point,  i.e.  the  initial  monetary  amount  presented  to  the 
respondent.  
Payment card method can also be used. Here respondents are presented with a number of preselected bids on 
the payment card and are asked to select the maximum amount of money they would be willing to pay. This 
method does avoid anchoring effect but the range of monetary amounts can still bias the results.

Carson and Hanemann (2005) highlight three factors affecting the design of a CV survey that contribute to incentive 
compatibility,  independently  of  the  elicitation  format  used:  (i)  consequentiality,    respondents  need  to  see  that  the 
survey aims at knowing whether the public supports a given policy at a given cost; (ii) plausibility, respondents see as 
plausible the good being valued and its costs; and (iii) appropriateness of the payment vehicle that can impose costs on 
all individuals if the policy is undertaken. 

Specific issues on questionnaire elaboration for CE 

One of the most important points for designing a CE questionnaire is to identify and describe the attributes and their 
levels. The attributes have to inform about the environmental change and provide relevant information to decision-
makers.  However,  with  increasing  number  of  attributes,  also  the  complexity  of  the  task  for  the  respondents  is 
increasing. Thus, it is important to find a good balance between both aspects.  

The  combinations  of  attributes  and  their  levels  should  form  plausible  alternatives.  Holmes  and  Adamowicz  (2003) 
pointed out that attributes in forest management may be highly correlated with natural processes. For example, the 
attributes species diversity and area not harvested may be so highly correlated that it is not possible to reach a high 
level of species diversity when only a small forest area is not harvested.  

Once the attributes are selected, a plausible range of levels for them has to be decided. A larger number of levels will 
be more informative, but it will produce a larger experimental design (see step 2). 

Once the attributes and their levels are selected, the number of alternatives presented in a choice set and a how the 
attribute  levels  are  combined  to  create  these  alternatives  has  to  be  decided.  A  typical  choice  set  has  a  current 
situation alternative and two hypothetical alternatives describing different forest situations that might be obtained in 
the future (see figure 5.6).  

The experimental design theory enables combining the attribute levels in a non-random manner, such that the effects 
that are interesting can be unveiled afterwards in the statistical analysis. 

Step 4: Definition of the target population 
Once  the  survey  is  written,  the  most  appropriate  target  audience  to  answer  the  questions  must  be  determined.  It 
generally corresponds to those people who may benefit (directly or indirectly) from the provision of the valued goods 
or services. 

According to Carson and Hanemann (2005), there are two different perspectives on defining the population of interest 
in a valuation survey. The first perspective is a legal and/or political one. The agency funding the survey may only be 
interested  about  the  welfare  of  particular  population  subgroups,  such  as  taxpayers  in  their  jurisdiction.  The  second 
perspective is based on a rough consideration of the costs and benefits of sampling from different groups. This means 
that  when  deciding  where  to  sample,  different  population  groups  (e.g.,  users  and  non-users)  should  always  be 
considered.  However,  there  is  always  a  trade-off  between  the  sampling  cost  and  completeness  of  the  sampled 
population. Especially, at it is rather challenging to define the population that holds non-use values. Bateman and al. 
(2002) list some factors to consider when determining non-user population(s): 

  Uniqueness or substitutability of the good or service in question. Unique resources are more likely to attract 

non-use values and their valuation requires sampling beyond the user population.  
Familiarity of respondents with the good or service. Related to the uniqueness, the familiarity with certain 
resources can decline with the distance. Hence, it is possible that with beyond certain distance, the good or 
service that is the topic of the survey will have no effect on the population.  
Scale of change. The more significant the change, the more likely it is to affect larger populations. 

 

 

Step 5: Definition of the sampling 
Once  the  relevant  population  is  defined,  the  sampling  approach  has  to  be  specified.  Stratification  is  a  common 
procedure as it increases sampling efficiency when compared to random sampling, where all the individuals from the 
target population have the same probability of being selected (Carson and Hanneman, 2005).  

 

74 

 

For example, in a national survey, provinces can represent strata. Drawing the correct proportion from each stratum 
eliminates  the  possibility  of  having  a  sample  that  comes  disproportionately  from  one  province.  One  reason  to  use 
stratification  is  also  to  capture  interest  differences,  for  example,  because  they  represent  key  subgroups  of  the 
population  for  which  the  researcher  wishes  to  obtain  separate  estimates  (e.g.  rural/urban  populations,  users/non-
users) (Bateman and al., 2002). The relevant strata can also be decided based on representativeness issues as well as 
on the relevant features of the population which allow controlling for its representativeness (e.g. gender, education, 
income).  

Step 6: Test the questionnaire in focus groups and pilot surveys 
A  focus  group  is  an  interview  conducted  by  a  moderator  among  a  small  group  of  respondents  in  an  unstructured 
manner. Focus groups typically have 6-12 participants plus a moderator and an assistant, who takes notes and records 
the session.  

Thus,  in  the  process  of  the  questionnaire  design,  it  is  recommended  to  test  whether  the  questionnaire  is  well 
understood, correctly worded, and has a credible scenario (Riera and al. 2012). Once the questionnaire is finished it is 
advisable  to  test  it  in  focus  groups  to  gain  insights  about  issues  of  interest  and  particular  questionnaire  design 
characteristics (Bateman and al. 2002).  

The  final  stage  of  pre-testing  the  questionnaire  involves  carrying  out  a  pilot  survey.  A  pilot  survey  consists  in 
administering a draft questionnaire to a sample of respondents similar to the one that will be used in the final survey. It 
serves  the  purpose  of  fine-tuning  the  questionnaire  and  of  training  the  interviewers.  20  respondents  constitute  the 
minimum for a pilot survey. 

Step 7: Launch the survey and collect the data for your sample 
Depending on the survey type chosen, the data collection may take from two months (for telephone or mail survey) 
to  one  month  (for  face-to-face  surveys)  or  even  less  (for  Internet  based  surveys).  If  a  poll  company  is  hired,  they 
usually provide with the data formatted as need for ulterior analysis. Otherwise, data processing is needed to adapt it 
for its analysis.  

Step 8: Statistical analysis 
Stated preference data is analysed through probabilistic regression models that take different approaches depending in 
whether CV or CE data is analysed.  

Specific issues for statistical analysis of contingent valuation data 

Once the CV survey has been conducted, data has to be analysed. The first step is defining the bid function to employ. 
The bid function explains the variation in WTP or WTA response based on the change in and the characteristics of the 
non-market good or service and other socio-economic characteristics of the respondents.  

Following standard economic theory, an indirect utility function V can be defined, that describes the maximum amount 
a  respondent  derives  from  his  income,  Y,  given  the  prices  of  goods,  P,  and  the  level  of  provision  of  the  good  or 
service,  Q.  It  is  also  assumed  that  the  utility  of  the  respondent  will  depend  on  other  demographic  and  economic 
factors, S. Hence, the indirect utility of the respondents can be written in the general form: 

V(Y,P,S, Q) 

When answering a CV question, respondents are assumed to be comparing their utility or well-being at the two levels 
of provision of the environmental good or service, Q0 and Q1. Assuming that the respondents experience a greater 
wellbeing  at  the  higher  level of  provision,  it  seems  reasonable  to  assume that  they  will  be  prepared  to pay  at  least 
something to achieve Q1. The quantity C can be defined such as: 

V(y, P, S, Q0)= V(Y- C, P, S, Q1) 

where  C  is  the  households  maximum  WTP  to  achieve  the  increase  in  provision  of  the  good  or  service.  By 
manipulating the equation above, C can be defined as a function of the other parameters in the model. This function, 
denoted as C, is known as the bid function and can be written in a general form as: 

 

75 

 

C= C(Q0, Q1, Y, P, S) = WTP 

Assuming a non-negative WTP for the respondents, economic theory states that the maximum WTP of respondents 
for any good or service is bounded by their ability to pay. In other words, their WTP must not be greater than their 
income, Y: 

0  C= C(Q0, Q1, Y, P, S) = WTP  Y 

In summary, the WTP values given by respondents to CV questions can be seen as the solution to a constrained utility 
maximising  problem.  The  solution  to  this  problem  is  represented  by  the  bid  function  that  relates  WTP  values  to 
income of respondents, characteristics of the respondents and the characteristics of the good or service to be valued.  

Once  the  bid  function  is  defined,  a  probability  function  should  be  specified.  A  probability  function  described  the 
likelihood of observing any particular value of a random variable, in this case the WTP variable. A probability function 
in CV studies is usually defined by: 

  A location parameter, which fixes the value of the central point in the distribution; 
  A scale parameter, which determines the dispersion of values around the central point.  

Some of the most usual probability functions employed in CV studies are the normal, log-normal, logistic, log-logistic 
or exponential. 

Once  the  bid  function  is  defined  and  also  the  distributional  assumption  is  described,  the  analyst  is  in  position  of 
estimating the parameters of the model: 

 

a,  that  determines  the  mid-point  of  the  distribution  of  the  WTP  variable  and  what  is  the  value  usually 
reported in CV studies; 

  2, that determines the spread of the probability distribution of WTP; 
 

, which determines the probability that a household will have zero WTP; 

Specific issues for statistical analysis of CE data 

The statistical analysis of the choice data informs the researcher about the likelihood that an individual will choose an 
alternative based on the attribute levels. The multinomial logit model (MNL) is the basic model to analyse the choice 
probability P that an individual n will choose alternative i out of j alternatives:  

P

exp(

Vin
)

)

Where Vin =  ' X, is the deterministic part of utility, ' are the estimated coefficients and X are the attributes.  

The outcomes of the MNL model are coefficient estimates for each of the attributes. These coefficients express how 
each  attribute  impacts  the  welfare  of  the  population.  Table  5.8  shows  the  results  of  an  MNL  model  from  a  survey 
conducted in Morocco (Mavsar and Farreras, 2010) to assess the non-market values of the Bouhachem forest.  

The  results  show  that  the  population  have  a  negative  preference  for  the  increase  of  degraded  and  eroded  in  the 
Bouhachem forest. So an increase in the degradation and erosion would have negative impact on populations welfare. 
Further, applying use restrictions and having more recreational opportunities in the site, would contribute positively to 
the respondents welfare.

5.3.2.2  Strengths and weaknesses of the stated preference methods 

Strengths of stated preference methods 

  They are the only available methods to estimate non-use values.  
  They can also be employed to estimate use values. 
  The  use  of  surveys  allows  to  collect  relevant  socioeconomic  and  attitudinal  data  on  the  respondents  that 

could be relevant for understanding the variables influencing social preferences and choices.  

  The use of surveys allows to estimate hypothetical changes and their impact before they have taken place.  
 

Participative  or  deliberative  approaches  before  valuing  the  good  or  service  at  stake  seem  to  provide  with 
more stable results (Christie and al., 2012). 

Weaknesses of stated preference methods 

 
Preferences for non-use values tend to be less stable. 
  Complex questionnaire development and data analysis. 
 
  High risk of biases that may lead to inaccurate WTP estimations.  
 

Budget and time demands are high. 

If  the  surveyed  population  has  a  low  level  of  literacy  it  would  pose  significant  constraints  for  the 
implementation  of  a  questionnaire  where  respondents  have  to  read.  In  such  cases,  face-to-face  interviews, 
use of local language and local enumerators are suggested.  

  The traditional knowledge people have, particularly in rural areas, may not always align with the approached 

used by experts in questionnaires.  

5.3.2.3  Application of the Contingent Valuation method 

The  contingent  valuation  method  is  one  of  the  most  used  economic  valuation  methods  in  economic  science  in  the 
Mediterranean. As an example, it can be mentioned several works that have been developed in different countries of 
the  region,  both  in  the  southern  and  the  northern  parts of  the  basin:  Turkey  (Tumay  and  Brouwer,  2007;  Pak  and 
Turker,  2006),    Italy  (Tempesta  and  al.,  2004),  France  (Garcia  and  al.,  2007),  Spain  (Solino  and  al.,  2010;  Riera  and 
Mogas, 2004). 

 

77 

 

To illustrate the application of the CV method the study chosen was developed in France. A specific CV study exists in 
Turkey, although it estimates the recreational use value of a forest site. Because the appealing of stated preference 
methods is their capacity of estimating non-use values, the chosen application is a study developed by Garcia and al. 
(2007) where the CV method is applied to estimate biodiversity values at the national level in France. The main goods 
and services valued were both use (e.g., resistance to catastrophes, food provision, medicines, raw materials, water 
supply, carbon storage, leisure, tourism) and non-use values (existence, legacy). 

The  scenario  of  valuation  was  the  hypothetic  implementation  of  different  protection  and  maintenance  measures  to 
conserve  the  biodiversity  of  forests.  The  main  question  was  :  what  amount  (between  6  and  90)  would  the 
households be willing to pay in order to finance those measures? 

The system used for surveying a reasonably large number of French citizens from the whole country was to prepare a 
referendum questionnaire that was presented by telephone to a sample of 4,500 households representing the whole 
society. The households were asked if they had visited any forests during the time surveyed, and more generally about 
their different activities in the forests. 

The  values  obtained  vary  according  the  revenues  and  regions.  The  main  WTP  for  the  whole  country  fluctuated 
between  45  and  64  per  household  per  year,  while  the  results  showed  significant  differences  between  the  north 
(including Paris) with a mean of around 64, the east (between 50 and 55) and the South-West of France (45). 

5.3.2.4  Applications of choice experiment method 

The range of goods and services than can be valued using this method is very wide, including both use values (forest 
fires risk prevention, leisure, sport, tourism, carbon sequestration, delaying erosion and loss of land productivity, raw 
materials,  timber,  non  woody  forest  products,  wood  and  forage,  water  cycle  regulation,  creation  of  jobs,  pollution 
absorption), and non-use values: existence (biodiversity, landscape), legacy (to the posterity), etc. 

A  considerable  number  of  CE  method  applications  were  found  in  different  Mediterranean  countries,  both  in  the 
northern and in the southern basin. For instance: Tunisia (Daly and al., 2012), Morocco (Mavsar et Farreras, 2011), 
Spain (Colombo and al., 2006; Brey and al., 2007) and France (Bonnieux and al., 2006). A non-Mediterranean study to 
be highlighted was carried out in the United Kingdom at the national level. This study was developed in cooperation 
with the public administration to support and assess forest policies (Willis and al., 2003). 

A study by Mavsar and Farreras (2011) illustrates the application of the CE method. This study assesses the WTP of 
the Moroccan society for different management options, aimed to improve or conservation different ecosystem goods 
and services provided by the Bouhachem forest, in northern Morocco. The main forest goods and services valued on 
the study are food and forage production, soil protection, water cycle regulation, biodiversity conservation, recreation 
and tourism. 

The study values how would different management programs affect to the provision of forest goods and services after 
ten  years  of  application.  Each  program  would  be  composed  by  different  attributes,  applied  in  different  degrees: 
conservation (reducing the loss of biodiversity and the perturbations in the cycle of water), soil protection (presented 
as erosion), restrictions to wood and forage provision, recreational and touristic activities. Each management option 
would cost a given amount of money, unless the status quo scenario, which would not have any cost. 

To obtain the data, a questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 396 individuals representing the Moroccan society 
(terms  of  age,  residence  and  gender  diversity).  Moreover,  to  obtain  more  precise  results,  the  researchers  used  a 
Latent  Class  Model.  This  type  of  models  assumes  that  the  population  is  divided  into  a  number  of  finite  groups  or 
classes  within  which  the  preferences  are  relatively  homogeneous  and  different  from  these  of  the  other  groups  or 
classes. The model that provided the best adjustment was a four-class model. The classes differ in socio-demographic 
parameters, for instance, rural or urban origin, incomes, use of forests, education, gender, etc. 

The results show (table 5.9) that the WTP of the Group 1 for the conservation, erosion and recreation attributes are 
not significant, which means that for this group changes in erosion and recreation attributes have no impact on the 

 

78 

 

welfare. On the other hand, they would pay 0.4012 for restricting the use of the forest. The WTP of Group 2 for the 
conservation attribute is the value is 0.28, which is the amount of money that the respondents would be willing to 
pay to conserve biodiversity.  

On the other hand, they would experience a loss of welfare of -0.61 per each extra unit (ha) of eroded forest area, 
and of -0.38 if the use of the forest is restricted. The WTP of Group 3 for the conservation attribute is 0.44 (they 
would  pay  for  conserving  biodiversity).  They  would  experience  a  loss  of  welfare  of  -0.61  for  each  extra  unit  of 
eroded surface. Their WTP for the restriction of the use of the forest is 0.17, and their WTP for the recreational 
attribute is 1.06. The WTP of the Group 4 for the conservation, erosion and restriction attributes is not significant. 
They would experience a welfare increase of 2.47 if the forest would be contributing to an increase of tourism.

damage, estimates from previous studies (often termed study sites) of similar changes in environmental quality to value 
the environmental change at the policy site.

The policy uses of the transferred economic estimates include: 

  CBA of investment projects and policies aimed at managing forests (e.g., preservation of forests, restrictions on 

 
 

cutting practices, and forest fire prevention measures), or projects that affect forests (e.g., road construction);  
Environmental accounting at the national level, i.e., including externalities of forests in green national accounts;  
Environmental costing, i.e., calculating marginal external costs as a basis for the optimal economic management of 
the forests and design of optimal regulatory instruments (e.g., environmental charges); 

  Natural  resource  damage  assessment  according  to  the  environmental  liability  directive,  i.e.,  calculating 

compensation payments for acute injuries to forest ecosystems. 

The  demand  for  accuracy  increases  when  moving  down  this  list  of  policy  uses  (Navrud,  2004),  however,  the  most 
frequent use of BT is in the CBA of projects and policies. 

There are two primary groups of BT methods (Navrud, 2004): 

  Unit value transfer method; 

Simple unit value transfer 

o 
o  Unit value transfer with income adjustments 

 

Function transfer method. 

o  Benefit function transfer 
o  Meta-analysis 

5.3.3.1  Unit value transfer method 

A  simple  unit  value  transfer  (i.e.,  from  one  study,  or  as  a  mean  value  estimate  from  several  studies)  is  the  simplest 
method to transferring benefit estimates from a study site, or as a mean from several study sites, to the policy site. 
This method assumes that the well-being experienced by an average individual at the study site is the same as will be 
experienced by the average individual at the policy site, and that the change in the environmental amenity being valued 
is the same at the two sites. Thus, the benefit estimate can be transferred directly, often expressed as a mean WTP 
(e.g., per household/year, per individual/visit) from the study site to the policy site.  

The main problem with simple unit value transfer is that individuals at the policy site may not value ecosystem services 
the same as the average individual at the study sites. There are two principal reasons for this difference. First, people 
at the policy site might be different from individuals at the study site in terms of income, education, religion, ethnic 
group  or  other  socio-economic  characteristics  that  affect  their  demand  for  recreation.  Second,  even  if  individual 
preferences at the policy and study sites were the same, the ecosystem services and the change in the good valued, 
might not be.  

It is recommended using the WTP/household/year as the transfer unit, and then aggregating over the total number of 
affected households to obtain an estimate of total benefits. Using WTP/individual/year might lead to the overestimation 
of total benefits when aggregated over individuals, as shown by Lindhjem and Navrud (2009). 

Unit  value  transfer  for  non-use  values,  (e.g.,  environmental  amenities),  from  SP  studies  might  be  more  difficult  to 
transfer than use values (e.g., recreation) for at least two reasons. Firstly, the unit of transfer is more difficult to define. 
While the obvious choice of unit for use values are consumer surplus per activity day, there is greater variability in 
reporting non-use values from CV surveys, both in terms of WTP for whom, and for what, time period. WTP can be 
reported as per household or per individual, and as a one-time payment, annually for a limited time period, annually for 
an  indefinite  time,  or  as  an  indefinite  monthly  payment.  Secondly,  the  WTP  is  reported  for  one  or  more  specified 
discrete changes, e.g., forest ecosystem services, and not on a marginal (e.g., per hectare) basis.  

WTP, as a one-time amount, might lead to an underestimation of annual WTP, as reported WTP will be the present 
value of a flow of annual WTP amounts and will be constrained by income of the respondents in the year they report 
their one-time WTP amount. Using this transfer unit for a specified change in environmental amenities also avoids the 
procedure of scaling up, or down, the reported WTP in relation to the size of the area at the policy site. Such scaling 
assumes a constant value per hectare and linearities in valuation (e.g., the marginal utility are constant over the whole 

 

80 

 

range), which does not seem to be the case in practice (see Figure 5.1) (see e.g. Lindhjem, 2007; Lindhjem and Navrud, 
2008). 

The  simple  unit  value  transfer  approach  should  not  be  used  for  transfers  between  countries  with  different  income 
levels  and  costs  of  living  (or  between  regions  with  very  different  income  levels  within  a  country).  To  conduct  this 
operation properly, the unit value transfer with income adjustments should be applied, using income elasticities of WTP 
between  0  and  1  (Kristrom  and  Riera,  1996).  When  there  is  a  lack  of  data  on  the  income  levels  of  the  affected 
populations  at  the  policy  and  study  sites,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  figures  can  used  as  proxies  for 
income  in  international  BT.  However,  this  approach  could  provide  incorrectly  estimated  results  in  BT  between 
countries,  when  income  levels  at  the  local  study  and/or  policy  site  deviates  from  the  average  income  level  of  the 
countries. 

Using official exchange rates to convert transferred estimates from the value at the study site, such as euro, to the 
national currency does not reflect the true purchasing power of currencies, since the official exchange rates reflect 
political  and  macroeconomic  risk  factors.  Thus,  purchasing  power  parity,  otherwise  called  adjusted  exchange  rates, 
should be used when transferring values from other countries. 

5.3.3.2  Function transfer method 

Transferring the entire benefit function13 is conceptually/theoretically more appealing than just transferring unit values, 
because  more  information  is  effectively  taken  into  account  in  the  transfer.  However,  transfer  evidence  is  mixed  in 
regard to whether function transfers performs better than unit value transfers (Bateman and al., 2009; Ready and al., 
2004). Often, it seems that the benefit function transfer does not reduce transfer errors significantly, in comparison to 
a simple unit value transfer.  

The benefits set to be transferred from the study site or several study sites to the policy site can be estimated using 
either RP methods like TC and HP or SP methods like the CV and CM. For example, for a CV the benefit function can 
be written as: 

(cid:1849)(cid:1846)(cid:1842)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)(cid:3404)(cid:2010)(cid:2868)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:2869)(cid:1833)(cid:3037)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:2870)(cid:1834)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)(cid:3397)(cid:2013) 

Where: WTPij is the willingness to pay of household i for site j; Gj is the set of characteristics of the environmental 

good at site j, and Hij is the set of characteristics of household i at site j, and (cid:2010)(cid:2868), (cid:2010)(cid:2869) and (cid:2010)(cid:2870) are sets of parameters; and 
(cid:2013) is the random error. 
To implement this approach, first a study in the existing literature has to be found, with estimates of the constant (cid:2010)(cid:2868), 
and the sets of parameters, (cid:2010)(cid:2869) and (cid:2010)(cid:2870). Then data on the two groups of independent variables, G and H, at the policy 

site have to be collected, and inserted into the equation, and estimate household WTP at the policy site. 

Instead of transferring the benefit function from one selected valuation study, results from several valuation studies 
could be combined in a meta-analysis to estimate one common benefit function (see Lindhjem, 2007; Zandersen and 
Tol,  2009  for  meta  analyses  of  forest  externalities).  The  function  transfer  enables  the  researcher  to  evaluate  the 
influence  of  a  wider  range  of  the  environmental  good  or  service  characteristics  ,  the  characteristics  of  the  samples 
used in each analysis (i.e., including characteristics of the population affected by the change in environmental quality), 
and the modelling assumptions. In practice, however, detailed characteristics of the good or service per study site and 
the population are often not reported in the primary studies.  

The  regression  equation  for  a  meta-analysis  would  look  similar  to  above  equation,  but  a  set  of  variables  reflecting 
differences  in  the  environmental  valuation  method  applied  needs  to  be  added;  i.e.,  Cs  =  characteristics  of  the 
methodology applied in study site; as meta analyses typically find that differences in valuation methodologies account 

                                                        

13 The benefit function statistically relates peoples willingness to pay to characteristics of the ecosystem and the 
people whose values were elicited.

for a significant part of the variation in the mean WTP across studies; WTPs. Thus, the meta-analysis equation would 
be: 

(cid:1849)(cid:1846)(cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:3404)(cid:2010)(cid:2868)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:2869)(cid:1833)(cid:3020)(cid:3037)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:2870)(cid:1834)(cid:3020)(cid:3037)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:2871)(cid:1829)(cid:3020)(cid:3397)(cid:2013) 

5.3.3.3  Main steps in the application of the benefit transfer method 

Based on the general guidelines for benefit transfer there is an eight step procedure (Riera and Signorello, 2012): 

Step 1: Identify the change in the environmental goods and services to be valued at the policy site 
The environmental goods and services that should be valued must be defined, their baseline level (e.g. frequency of 
recreational use at the policy site, and availability and quality of substitute sites), and the magnitude and direction of 
change. 

Step 2: Identify the affected population at the policy site 
It  is  important  to  identify  the  size  of  the  affected  population  at  the  policy  site  before  the  review  of  the  valuation 
literature.  The  transferred  value  should  come  from  the  same  type  of  affected  individuals  in  terms  of  spatial  scale. 
Population characteristics also need to be similar in order to ensure they share the same type and level of welfare 
determinants. 

For example, when valuing the use value of recreation activities, the relevant affected population is the recreationists. 
However, if estimating both use and non-use values, and the policy site is only of local importance (e.g. a small forest 
area with many substitute sites regionally), only the local population (e.g., municipality) is used.  

For use values, the number of individuals (e.g., recreationists) should be estimated before and after the change. In the 
case  of  non-use  values  (or  use  and  non-use  values  combined)  the  number  of  households  should  be  the  unit  of 
aggregation at the relevant geographical scale (community, regional/county or national level). 

Step 3: Conduct a literature search to identify relevant primary studies 
The next step is to conduct a literature search to identify relevant primary studies. The preferred source are database, 
but supplemented by journal and general web search. Databases like EVRI14, ENVALUE15 and ValueBaseSWE16  can be 
used to identify similar studies from the same country or other closely located countries (which share the same type 
of institutional and cultural context) (Lindhjem and Navrud, 2008). Journal articles and databases of valuation studies 
often do not have all the data needed to determine whether a study is relevant. Thus, if available, the full study report 
should be collected.  

Step 4: Assessing the relevance/similarity and quality of study site values for transfer 
The quality of the relevant valuation studies is assessed in terms of scientific soundness and richness of information. 
Desvousges and al. (1998) identify the following criteria for assessing the quality and relevance of candidate studies for 
transfer:  

 

Scientific  soundness  -  the  transfer  estimates  are  only  as  good  as  the  methodology  and  assumptions 
employed in the original studies: 
o 

Sound  data  collection  procedures  (for  SP  surveys  this  means  either  personal  interviews,  or 
mail/internet surveys with high response rate (>50 %), and questionnaires based on results from 
focus groups and pre-tests to test wording and scenarios); 
Sound empirical methodology (i.e. large sample size; adhere to best practice-guidelines guidelines 
for SP and RP studies, e.g., Riera and Signorello, 2012); 

o

16Available at:  http://www.beijer.kva.se/valuebase.htm 

82 

 

 

 

 

o  Consistency  with  scientific  or  economic  theory  (e.g.  links  exists  between  endpoints  of  dose-
response  functions  and  the  unit  used  for  valuation,  statistical  techniques  employed  should  be 
sound;  and  CV,  CM,  HP  and  TC  functions  should  include  variables  predicted  from  economic 
theory to influence valuation).  

Relevance - the original studies should be similar and applicable to the new context: 

o  Magnitude (and direction) of change in the ecosystem goods and services should be similar; 
o  Baseline level of the environmental good or service should be similar; 
o  Affected eco-system services and environmental goods should be similar; 
o  The affected sites should be similar when relevant (e.g. when assessing recreational values); 
o  Duration and timing of the impact should be similar; 
o 
o  Property rights, culture, institutional setting should be similar. 

Socio-economic characteristics of the affected population should be similar; 

Richness in detail  the original studies should provide a detailed dataset and accompanying information: 
o 

Identify full specification of the primary valuation equations, including precise definitions and units of 
measurements of all variables, as well as their mean values; 
Explanation of how substitutes (and complementary) goods or services per sites were treated; 

o 
o  Data on participation rates and extent of aggregation employed; 
o  Provision of standard errors and other statistical measures of dispersion. 

 
All  three  criteria  and  their  components  are  equally  important  for  assessing  the  relevance  and  quality  of  the  study. 
Based  on  these  three  criteria,  Riera  and  Signorello  (2012)  developed  a  check  list  for  judging  the  similarity  of 
characteristics  of  the  good  or  service  and  population  at  the  study  sites  versus  policy  site  for  forest  externality 
valuation studies: 

 

 

Characteristics of the good: 
o  Similar  good  or  service?  (i.e.  similar  type  forest,  similar  use  and/or  non-use  value  components; 

similar recreational activities, similar ecosystem services); 

o  Similar baseline, size and direction of change in the good or service valued? (To avoid scaling up and 
down values according to the size of the area, involving strict assumptions in terms of e.g. constant 
value per ha of use and/or non-use values; rather consider foreign study sites with nearly similar size 
than  domestic  study  sites  with  a  very  different  scale.  The  same  applies  to  the  baseline  and  the 
direction of the change. However, the general recommendation is to choose a domestic study site 
geographically as close as possible);   

o  Similar availability of substitute sites? (For use values: recreational sites; for non-use values: national 

parks and other preserved areas and the ecosystem services they contain); 

o  Similar forestry management regimes? (Similar property rights, similar access rights to private forests 

for recreation, etc.). 

Population characteristics: 
o  Similar average income level (and income distribution)? (If not, income adjustments should be made 

when performing the value transfer); 

o  Similar gender, age and educational composition?; 
o  Similar size of affected population? Expected similar distance decay, if any, in non-use values?; 
o  Similar attitudes to forest preservation? (attitudinal and cultural factors). 

Step 5: Select and summarize the data available from the study site(s) 
Several parallel approaches should be applied, and the results from these should be used to present a range of values: 
studies  providing  low  and  high  estimates,  which  can  define  a  lower  and  upper  bound  for  the  transferred  estimate, 
respectively.  Data  on  the  mean  value  estimate  and  standard  error,  and  specific  spatial  transfer  errors  should  be 
collected if available. 

 

83 

 

Relevant  meta-analyses  should  be  consulted  (e.g.  Rosenberger  and  Loomis,  2000  for  recreational  activities,  and 
Lindhjem, 2007 for both recreational use and non-use values) to see if the scope of these is narrow enough to provide 
relevant  information  about  the  estimates  to  be  transferred.  The  scope  of  the  meta-analysis  could  be  too  wide  to 
produce reliable estimates if the meta-analysis consists of studies which vary a lot in terms of methodology, and the 
environmental good considered.  

Step 6: Transfer value estimate from study site(s) to policy site 
This step consists of three main activities: 

Determine the transfer unit 

The  recommended  unit  of  transfer  for  use  and  non-use  values  is  the  WTP  per  individual  (household)  and  year. 
However, in some cases also other unit values can be used. For example, consumer surplus per day (or per visit) for 
recreation or unit costs for carbon sequestration (e.g., cost per ton of carbon).  

When using WTP per ha of an ecosystem or landscape type it assumes both the same size of the affected population 
and that the value per ha is constant. However, empirical evidence shows that WTP does not increase proportionally 
with the number of ha of ecosystems or landscape types (for non-timber benefits of forests; see Lindhjem, 2007). Since 
SP surveys clearly show that WTP per unit of area varies widely, it is not recommended converting households  stated 
mean WTP for a discrete change in environmental quality to marginal values like WTP per ha.  

Determine the transfer method for spatial transfer 

If the policy site is considered to be very close to the study sites in all respects, unit value transfer can be used. If there 
are  several  equally  suitable  study  sites  to  transfer  from,  they  should  all  be  evaluated  and  the  transferred  values 
calculated to form a value range.  

For  unit  transfers  between  countries,  differences  in  currency,  income  and  cost  of  living  between  countries  can  be 
corrected for by using purchase power parity (PPP) corrected exchange rates17. Within a country unit value transfer 
can be used with an adjustment for differences in income level, and an income elasticity of WTP lower than 1.  

Function  transfer  can  be  used  if  value  functions  have  sufficient  explanatory  power18 and  contain  variables  for  which 
data is readily available at the policy site. Most often the best model is based on variables where new surveys have to 
be conducted at the policy site to collect data. This in most cases will require similar effort (resources and time) as a 
complete valuation study.  

In general unit transfer method with income adjustment (where necessary) is recommended as the simplest and most 
transparent way of transfer both within and between countries. This transfer method has in general also been found to 
be just as reliable as the more complex procedures of value function transfers and meta-analysis. This is mainly due to 
the low explanatory power of WTP functions of SP studies, and the fact that methodological choice has a stronger 
impact on the results than the characteristics of the site and the affected populations.  

Determine the transfer method for temporal transfer 

The standard approach to adjust the value estimate from the time of data collection to current currency is to use the 
consumer price index (CPI) for the policy site country. If values from a study site are transferred outside the policy 
site country, the first point is to convert to local currency in the year of data collection; using PPP corrected exchange 
rates in the year of data collection, and then use the national CPI to update to current-currency values. 

Step 7: Calculate total benefits or costs  
For non-use values, mean WTP/household/year is multiplied by the total number of affected households to derive the 
annual benefit or cost. If WTP at the study site is stated as annual WTP for e.g. 5 or 10 years, the total benefits or 
costs should be calculated as the present value (PV) over that same period. On the other hand, if WTP is stated as 

                                                        

17 For example: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/56/1876133.xls 
18 Roughly said to be having a higher adjusted R2 than 0.5, i.e. explaining more than 50 % of the variation in value 

 

84 

 

one-time amounts, the amounts must be viewed as a present value (of  all benefits from the environmental good in 
question). 

The general equation for calculation the present value of the benefits PV (B) is:  

(cid:1842)(cid:1848)(cid:4666)(cid:1828)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)(cid:3533)(cid:1828)(cid:3047)(cid:4666)1(cid:3397)(cid:1870)(cid:4667)(cid:3047)

(cid:3415)

 

(cid:3021)
(cid:3047)(cid:2880)(cid:2868)
(cid:1842)(cid:1848)(cid:4666)(cid:1828)(cid:4667)(cid:3404)(cid:1828)(cid:3047)(cid:1870)(cid:3415)  

where Bt is the total benefits in year t, T is the time horizon  (for the stated WTP amounts) and r is the social discount 
rate.  

If the time horizon is not stated in the WTP question in SP surveys, it is assumed that this is an annual payment over 
an infinite time horizon. In this case, and if the annual benefits Bt are the same each year: 

Annual benefits Bt are equal to aggregated WTP over the affected population (WTPtot), which can be calculated as:  

WTPtot = n x WTPi 

where n is the number of affected households, and WTPi is mean WTP for household i. Since WTP per household 
varies between different parts of the affected population (e.g. with distance from the site, whether users and/or non-
users  are  considered  etc.),  the  estimates  from  the  study  site(s)  should  be  based  on  the  same  type  of  affected 
population as at the policy site.  

When  calculating  use  values,  in  the  above  equations  households  are  replaced  by  individuals  (e.g.,  recreationists). 
Hence, total value of the change is estimated by multiplying the consumer surplus per activity day with the increase or 
decrease in number of activity days. For uses other than recreation, values are often elicited on a household basis, and 
the same procedure as for non-use values can be employed. 

Step 8: Assess the uncertainty and transfer error / Conduct a sensitivity analysis 
Validity tests of benefit transfer (Navrud, 2004) indicate that the transferred economic estimates should be presented 
with error bounds of + 40 %. However, if the sites are very similar, or the primary study was designed with transfer to 
sites similar to the policy site in mind, an error bound of + 20 % could be used. 

If  the  study  and  policy  sites  are  not  quite  close,  unit  transfer  could  still  be  used,  but  arguments  for  over-  and 
underestimation in the transfer should be listed and the unit value should be presented with error bounds of + 100%. 
Ready  and  Navrud  (2006)  summarize  the  experience  from  international  validity  studies  and  find  that  these  transfer 
errors are not different from those observed for transfers within a country. They find that the average transfer error 
for international benefit transfers tends to be in the range of 20% to 40%, but individual transfers have errors as high 
as 100200%. 

Riera and Signorello (2012) define four categories of how good the fit is between the study site and the policy site 
(Table 5.11). The level of fit is based on the check list for judging the similarity between the study and policy sites (see 
step 4).

The transfer errors in the table 5.11 refer to the mean WTP estimate, and would come in addition to the uncertainty 
of  the  valuation  methods  applied  in  the  primary  valuation  study.  The  uncertainty  about  the  size  of  the  affected 
population would also have to be added to the estimate of total benefits.  

When there is a need for value estimates of environmental goods and services for policy purposes, it is recommended 
to conduct a CBA or conducting a new valuation study. This CBA should help to determine whether the costs of a 
new valuation study are worth the benefits in terms of taking the wrong decision. 

5.3.3.4  Strengths and weaknesses of the benefit transfer method 

Strengths of the benefit transfer method 

Benefit transfer is typically less costly than conducting an original valuation study. 
Economic benefits can be estimated more quickly than when undertaking an original valuation study. 

 
 
  The method can be used as a screening technique to determine if a more detailed, original valuation study 

should be conducted. 

  The method can easily and quickly be applied for making gross estimates of recreational values. The more 

similar the sites and the recreational experiences, the fewer biases will result. 

Weaknesses of the benefit transfer method: 

 

Benefit  transfer  may  not  be  accurate,  except  for  making  gross  estimates  of  recreational  values,  unless  the 
sites share all of the site, location, and user specific characteristics. 

  Good studies for the policy or issue in question may not be available. 
 
It may be difficult to track down appropriate studies, since many are not published. 
  Reporting of existing studies may be inadequate to make the needed adjustments. 
  Adequacy of existing studies may be difficult to assess. 
 
 
  Unit value estimates can quickly become dated. 

Extrapolation beyond the range of characteristics of the initial study is not recommended. 
Benefit transfers can only be as accurate as the initial value estimate. 

5.3.3.5  Applications of the benefit transfer method 

As  already  mentioned,  benefit  transfer  is  not  a  valuation  method,  but  just  transfers  values  from  existing  valuation 
studies. Thus, the benefit transfer method can be used for the valuation of any ecosystem good or service for which 
valuation studies are available. However, the benefit transfer accuracy very much depends on the quality of the initial 
valuation studies and the similarity of the characteristics of the valued ecosystem of ecosystem goods and services, and 
the population characteristics.  

In  general,  benefit  transfer  based  on  SP  surveys  (especially  CV)  usually  have  much  lower  explanatory  power  than 
functions based on TC and HP studies. Thus, it could be more relevant to use function transfer transferring estimates 
from RP methods.  

Benefit  transfer  studies  carried  out  in  the  field  of  environmental  valuation  have  been  applied  to  a  variety  of  fields, 
including the provision of wetland functions across North America and Europe (Brouwer and al., 1999), fresh water 

86 

 

 

fishing (Sturtevant and al., 1995), air pollution (Smith and Huang, 1995), benefits of endangered species (Loomis and 
White, 1996), visibility in national parks (Smith and Osborne, 1996) and general outdoor recreation (Smith and Kaoru, 
1990a and Smith and Kaoru, 1990b; Walsh and al., 1992).  

Two  function  transfer  analysis  in  Europe  have  focused  specifically  on  recreation  in  forests  as  opposed  to  general 
outdoor recreation. These have focused on studies carried out in the UK (Bateman and al., 1999; Bateman and Jones, 
2003).  Two  further  European  studies  have  focused  on  wider  non-market  benefits  derived  from  forests  such  as  the 
value of forest protection, biodiversity and multiple use forestry in Norway, Sweden and Finland (Lindhjem, 2007) and 
in Finland (Pouta and Rekola, 2005). 

Zandersen and Tol (2009) conducted a function transfer method to study recreational values in Europe. This study 
systematically analysed the variation in data from different sources, to identify the extent to which methods, design and 
data  affect  reported  forest  recreation  values.  Only  studies  conducted  in  Europe  that  have  applied  the  travel  cost 
method had been considered. A total of 26 studies from nine European countries published between 1977 and 2001 
were used.  

The data indicates that there is a substantial variance in forest recreation values across studies, ranging from 0.66 to 
112 per trip with a median of 4.52. Despite the similarities in valuation methods applied (all studies were conducted 
with travel cost method) and environmental service valued, the summarised benefit estimates reflect methodological, 
geographical and temporary differences. Namely, the values are influenced by the measurement of value (e.g., value per 
trip,  per  day  or  per  season),  by  the  travel  cost  approach  (i.e.,  zonal  versus  individual  travel  cost  method),  by  the 
definition  of  costs  (i.e.,  inclusion  and  level  of  opportunity  cost  of  time,  composition  of  car-borne  travel  costs)  and 
other  methodological  issues  (e.g.,  inclusion  of  substitute  sites,  postal  or  face  to  face  interviews,  or  specification  of 
functional form of the meta-analysis). 

Also, the inclusion of exogenous data on location and site characteristics reveals that site-specific characteristics such 
as size, age diversity, area of open land within a forest site have distinctive effects on benefits summarised in a meta-
analysis. 

According to our best knowledge, there were no systematic implementations of the benefit transfer. 

5.3.4  Which method to use ? 

This  chapter  lists  several  methods  for  the  valuation  of  forest  goods  and  services.  Some  of  them  (e.g.  travel  cost 
method, hedonic pricing) are relaying on the revealed behaviour of the users for these goods, while others are using 
surveys  and  directly  asking  users  about  their  WTP  for  certain  goods  or  services  (e.g. contingent  valuation  method, 
choice modelling).  

The advantage of the first group of methods (revealed preference methods) is that they are based on actual market 
behaviour  of  users  of  the  non-market  goods  and  services  (e.g.  paying  a  higher  price  for  a  house  because  of  a  nice 
forest  view);  however,  their  applicability  is  limited  only  to  a  few  non-market forest  goods  and  services  (recreation, 
tourism and landscape aesthetics).  

The methods in the second group (stated preference methods) can be applied to all types of non-market forest goods 
and  services.  Although  SP  methods  can  also  be  employed  to  measure  use  values,  they  are  thought  to  be  the  only 
option available for estimating these services that are valued for non-use purposes (Kramer and al., 2004).  

However, their main disadvantages are that they are based on hypothetical situations (no real market transaction is 
performed and the received answer might not reflect the real situation) and their application is complex (specialists 
are needed for the development of the questionnaire and for data analysis) and time consuming. Nevertheless, in the 
last decade the methodology and knowledge on these methods have improved considerably, enabling sound estimation 
of economic values of non-market goods and services. 

Table  5.12  and  5.13  show  an  overview  of  the  valuation  methods  and  in  which  cases  they  are  suitable.  The 
recommendations are very general, and are based on the objective to be less time and resource consuming. Mostly RP 
methods  are  preferred  because  they  are  based  on  actual  behaviour,  that  is  always  more  reliable  than  hypothetical 

 

87 

 

behaviour.  Furthermore,  RP  methods  rely  on  historical  data  (decision  already  made)  while  SP  methods  are  more 
flexible, allowing the assessment of hypothetical future situations/policies.

All these methods are potential tools; employing one or the other will depend on the objectives of the study and of 
the degree of familiarity the researcher has with the different methods. The final selection of the method depends on 
many  factors,  like:  (i)  type  and  number  of  objects  to  be  valued;  (ii)  relevant  population  (e.g.  users  or  non-users  or 
both; geographical scope (local, regional, national, international); (iii) data availability (e.g. restricted data access  data 
on house values); (iv) available time and financial resources; (v) team (e.g. experience).  

The benefit transfer method is an alternative to RP and SP methods, as it typically requires less resources and time. 
However, it is not a valuation method, as it only uses values estimated in other valuation studies, which are performed 
for similar goods or services, and then transfers this values to estimate the value of goods or services on another site 
by using correction factors or meta-data analysis. However, the method is still relatively new and no widely accepted 
standards for its application have been adopted yet. Thus, the obtained values can be significantly biased (e.g., in some 
cases  estimation  errors  above  100%  have  been  found).  Therefore,  it  should  be  used  with  care  and  precaution  as  a 
result of its limitations (e.g. accuracy of the estimated values depending on the accuracy of values used for transfer).

6. RECOMMENDATIONS ON PILOT SITES 

The objective of this chapter is to present currently important goods and services on the four selected pilot sites and the 
expected future changes that could influence the provision of these forest goods and services. This data is then completed 
with  recommendations  regarding  the  methods  that  could  be  applied  to  estimate  the  economic  value  of  the  potential 
changes in goods and services provision.  

6.1  Introduction 

Based on the questionnaires distributed to the thematic experts, information was  collected about forest goods  and 
services currently important at the four selected pilot sites (Chrea National Park in Algeria, Jabal Moussa Biosphere 
Reserve in Lebanon, Duzlercami forest in Turkey, and Maamora forest in Morocco). Furthermore, the main drivers of 
change  and  their  possible  impact  on  the  provision  of  forest  goods  and  services  on  these  sites  were  explored.  This 
information served to develop recommendations on methods that could be applied for the valuation of changes in the 
provision of forest goods and services. 

When developing these recommendations following general rules were considered: 

1.  Literature and established good practice guidelines: the recommendations follow the established scientific 
knowledge and guidelines available in literature. Furthermore, they are based on the acquired expertise of the 
authors of this report. 

2.  Limited resources and time: the implementation of the evaluation is foreseen to take place in the second 
year of the project. Certain valuation methods require significant financial resources and participation of different 
stakeholder groups, which is often very time consuming. Thus, a general guideline was to always select methods 
that would be less resource demanding and time consuming.  

Thus, it was decided that the evaluation of management alternatives should be done with the CBA. The application of 
this method requires that all impacts of alternative management approaches are estimated in monetary terms. Hence, 
in  the  following  sections  recommendations  have  been  made  on  which  of  these  methods  could  be  applied  on  the 
selected pilot sites.  

6.2  Pilot site: Chrea National Park, Algeria 

6.2.1  Most important goods and services  

The main goods and services provided by the forest of Chrea are: 

Direct use values: main identified direct use values are leisure, tourism, and historic and educational services. They 
are provided on 80% of the protected area. The main beneficiaries are visitors, and its provision trend seems to be 
increasing. Aesthetic services were also identified. They are provided by the whole surface of the protected area, and 
benefit the local rural and urban population, as well as visitors. The trend of provision seems to be increasing. 

Direct  use  values  with  market  prices: about  50% of the surface of the protected area allows food production, 
which seems to have a constant provision level. Approximately 10%-20% of the pilot site area provides possibilities to 
collect  decoration  materials  (decreasing  trend),  pharmaceuticals,  cosmetics  and  other  raw  materials  for  industrial 
application (increasing). The main beneficiaries of this group of products are the local rural and urban population and 
site visitors. 

Indirect use values: between 80%-100% of the pilot site area provides a variety of indirect use - ecological services. 
Among these water cycle regulation (constant trend) and carbon sequestration (increasing trend) are benefiting the 
whole  society.  Furthermore,  100%  of  the  protected  area  provides  ecological  services  that  benefit  local  rural 

90 

 

 

population, as well as the local urban population, and visitors. Those services are: water purification (constant trend), 
water  protection  (increasing  trend),  health  protection  (increasing  trend),  and,  finally,  climate  regulation  (constant 
trend), which also affects a wider range of beneficiaries. 

Non-use values: main identified non-use forest services are existence and heritage values, which are mainly derived 
from biodiversity protection. These services are provided on the whole pilot site area, it benefits the whole society, 
and the provision trend seems to be constant. 

6.2.2  Expected changes in the provision of goods and services 

The main drivers that affect the provision of goods and services are: 

 

 

Increase  in  number  of  forest  visitors,  which  affects  negatively  the  biodiversity  protection  and  forest 
aesthetics.  

  Forest  fires,  which  also  affect  negatively  the  biodiversity  protection,  as  well  as  forest aesthetics,  and  soil 

protection.  
Illegal  harvesting  of  non-wood  forest  products  (medicinal  plants,  lichens,  mushrooms...)  affects 
negatively the biodiversity protection and forest aesthetics. 

6.2.3  Recommendation for the valuation of changes in the provision of goods and 

services 

Table  6.1  summarises  the  above  mentioned  drivers  and  goods  and  services  that  would  be  affected,  and  proposes 
methods that could be applied for the valuation of different impacts.

The main services that would be affected are biodiversity protection, aesthetics and soil protection. 

According to the case study description, it seems that this site is rather important in terms of provision of non-wood 
forest  products.  Thus,  a  loss  in  biodiversity  would  also  have  negative  effects  on  the  quantities  and  quality  of  these 
products. Hence, to assess the value of biodiversity protection market price based method would be applied to assess 
the losses of consumer surplus due to decreased harvesting of non-wood forest products. Alternatively, if sufficient 
resources  are  available,  the  biodiversity  protection  could  also  be  valued  by  the  application  of  stated  preference 
methods.  In  this  case,  the  value  of  certain  or  a  number  of  plant  and  animal  species,  which  could  be  lost  if  no 
improvement in management is implemented, would be estimated. 

 

91 

 

In the case of soil protection the valuation can be performed with cost based methods. By applying the replacement 
cost  method,  the  cost  of  replacing  the  lost  soil  would  be  assessed.  Alternatively,  the  damage  cost  avoided  method 
would consider the cost of protection measures (e.g., barriers) to estimate the value of soil protection. 

Finally,  for  aesthetics  services,  the  application  of  stated  preference  methods  (choice  experiment  or  contingent 
valuation) is recommended where visitors and residents could assess the economic value of the current and alternative 
landscape images. However, it should be noted that this would require significant resources and expertise.  

6.3  Pilot site: Jabal Moussa Biosphere Reserve, Lebanon 

6.3.1  Most important goods and services  

The main goods and services provided by the forest of Jabal Moussa are: 

Direct  use  values  with  market  prices:  the  main  identified  direct  values  are  ecotourism,  and  cultural  values. 
Ecotourism  benefits  the  local  rural  and  urban  population,  and  the  visitors.  Its  trend  of  provision  seems  to  be 
increasing. Furthermore, a number of other direct use values were listed: 

  Charcoal  and  firewood  benefit  forest  owners  and  the  local  rural  population,  and  its  trend  of  provision  is 

constant; 

  Aromatic plants (e. g., Origanum syriacum, Salvia fruticosa), whose main beneficiaries are forest owners, local 

rural population, the local urban population, and the traders (trend of provision increasing);  

  Medicinal  plants  (e.  g.,  Myrthus communis),  whose  main  beneficiaries  are  forest  owners  and  the  local  rural 

population (constant trend of provision);  

  Honey  production,  whose  main  beneficiaries  are  forest  owners,  local  rural  and  urban  population,  and  the 

retailers (constant trend of provision);  

  Game (e. g., migratory birds), whose main beneficiaries are forest owners, the local rural population, the local 

urban population (constant trend of provision);  
Pastures, whose main beneficiary is the local rural population (constant provision trend);  

 
  Moreover, fruits harvesting (e. g., pinions of Pinus pinea) benefits local rural population (constant provision 

trend). 

Non-use values: the main non-use forest service identified for the forest of Jabal Moussa is the conservation of the 
Lebanon Cedrus (Cedrus libani), as a cultural and natural legacy. This beneficiary of this service is the whole population 
of Lebanon. 

6.3.2  Expected changes in the provision of goods and services 

The main drivers that affect the provision of the mentioned goods and services are: 

  Climate change (increased temperatures, decreased rainfall) affects negatively the production of honey, the 

harvesting of fruits, and of aromatic and medicinal plants, as well as the production of fodder. 

  Forest fires have a negative effect on ecotourism and production of fruits, aromatic and medicinal plants. In 

exchange, they affect positively the production of charcoal.  

  Urbanisation affects negatively ecotourism, production of honey, fruits, and aromatic and medicinal plants. 
 

Implementation  of  a  ministerial  decision  for  the  protection  of  medicinal  and  aromatic  plants 
will affect positively the production and harvesting of aromatic and medicinal plants. 

 

92 

 

6.3.3  Recommendation for the valuation of changes in the provision of goods and 

services 

The  expected  changes  in  the  provision  of  forest  goods  and  services,  will  mainly  affect  the  provision  of  non-timber 
forest products and the possibilities for ecotourism (table 6.2). 

This pilot site is considered as an important source of non-timber forest products, like honey, fruits, medicinal and 
aromatic plants, fire wood. Thus, a loss in the provision of these products would have a negative effect on the income 
generation possibilities for the local population and visitors. Hence, to assess the value of these products the market 
price based method could be used. With the help of this method the losses of consumer surplus due to decreased 
harvesting of non-wood forest products would be estimated. An alternative approach would be to estimate the cost of 
replacement of some of these products (e.g., fodder), with alternative products (e.g., barley).

Another  important  impact  could  be  the  decrease  in  number  of  visitors  (ecotourism)  to  this  pilot  site,  due  to  the 
impacts  of  forest  fires  and  urbanisation  in  the  area.  The  estimation  of  the  economic  loss  caused  by  decreased 
ecotourism activities could be done with market prices. The approach would consider the lost number of visitors and 
consequently the loss of income for the local/regional economy.  

This loss could be estimated based on the average expenditure per visitor (e.g., accommodation, entrance fees, food) 
and  the  number  of  lost  visitors.  Alternatively  this  could  be  estimated  by  using  the  travel  cost  method,  where  the 
number of visitors and their consumer surplus per visit would be estimated on-site.   

6.4  Pilot site: Maamora forest, Morocco 

6.4.1  Most important goods and services  

The main goods and services provided on the whole area of the Maamora forest and showing an increasing trend in 
the demand by the population, are: 

Direct  use  values:  Recreation  is  provided  to  the  local  population  and  to  visitors.  Further,  these  activities  are  a 
source  of  employment  for  the  rural  and  urban  local  population.  There  is  a  vast  diversity  of  other  forest  products 
produced in the Maarmora forest that benefit the forests administration and the local rural and urban population: 

93 

 

 

Extensive grazing is benefiting local rural and urban population; 

  Cork extraction, which mainly benefits the administration and the rural population; 
 
  Truffles produce benefits for the local rural and urban population;  
 

Fuel wood is important for the whole society, although it is in particular important for the local residents. 

Indirect  use  values:  soil  protection,  air  purification  and  carbon  sequestration  are  the  main  indirect  use  values 
provided by the Maamora forests and they benefit the whole society.  

Non-use  values:    biodiversity  enhancement  is  provided  on  the  whole  pilot  site  area,  and  is  benefiting  the  whole 
Moroccan society. 

6.4.2  Expected changes in the provision of goods and services 

The main drivers that affect the provision of the goods and services mentioned below are a compilation of the two 
contributors that seem to have filled in the form: 

 

Intensification  of  agriculture,  which is expected to be triggered by the adoption of a policy that should 
prevent migration from rural areas. Most likely this will increase the production of food and fodder but, due 
to the likely increase pressure on the resource, the forest cover is expected to be reduced. Therefore soil 
protection and biodiversity protection will be reduced.  

  Overgrazing  may  increase  the  erosion  processes  and  the  availability  of  water.  On  the  other  hand  the 

decreased density of forest stands, may have a mitigation impact on forests fires.  

 

  Development  of  tourism  in  the  area  will  increase  recreational  opportunities  for  the  visitors  and  the 
revenues  from  this  activity  for  local  population.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  very  likely  that  the  traditional 
activities linked to the use of forest products will gradually disappear, entailing a loss of knowledge.  
Implementation of forest conservation policy, that foresees to increase the quality and the protection 
of forests. This program is linked to a program of touristic enhancement. A significant effort will be made in 
reducing forest fires to ensure with more security to the visitors and maintain the forest cover. This program 
will increase the tourism in the area and the fire protection, while it is expected that it will decrease fuel 
wood production and water provision.  

6.4.3  Recommendation for the valuation of changes in the provision of goods and 

services 

The main drivers and expected changes in the provision of goods and services are summarised in table 6.4.

For the valuation of the economic value of grazing (fodder) the replacement cost method could be used, where the 
costs of alternative grazing possibilities would be considered. Another possibility would be to use market prices of the 
lost fodder units. 

A similar approach would also be taken in the case of fuel wood where the replacement of fuel wood by alternative 
energy sources would be considered. In this case the price of alternative energy and the costs of replacing the current 
energy  generating  equipment  (e.g.,  stoves)  should  be  considered.  The  second  possible  approach  would  be  the 
calculation of the lost consumer/producer surplus, due to reduced fuel wood consumption/production. 

In the case of soil protection the valuation can be performed by applying the replacement cost method to assess the 
cost of replacing the lost soil (e.g., the cost of transportation and distribution of new soil). Alternatively, the damage 
cost avoided method would take into account the cost of protection measures (e.g., barriers) to estimate the value of 
soil protection. 

Recreation value would be estimated with the help of the individual or zonal travel cost method. To accomplish this 
task information on the number of visits and the costs incurred by visitors to reach the forest for recreation activities 
should be collected. 

Improvement  of  landscape  aesthetics  would  be  another  positive  effect  of  the  implementation  of  a  strategy  for 
protection  of  urban  and  peri-urban  forests.  In  this  case  stated  preference  methods  (contingent  valuation  of  choice 
experiment) would be the first choice. However, an alternative would be the hedonic pricing method as it is expected 
that housing  prices in the area would reflect the improved forest aesthetics. Although, the application  of a hedonic 
pricing method is very dependent on the real estate market data availability.   

It is expected that waste accumulation would be one of negative effects of increased recreation activities. To estimate 
the economic value of this negative effect, the damage cost avoided method could be applied. In this case the value 
would be assessed costs of waste removal, which would be needed to avoid ecosystem damage.  

Finally, to estimate the value of biodiversity enhancement most likely one of the stated preference method (contingent 
valuation  method  or  choice  modelling)  would  be  applied.  Although,  these  methods  are  complicated  and  costly  in 
application,  they  would  provide  good  information  about  the  social  value  of  biodiversity  (e.g.,  providing  the  value  of 
non-use values). Depending on the exact type of ecosystem services considered, an alternative approaches could be 
taken. For example, in the case of hunting or collection of certain plant species, market value of the collected products 
or hunting permits can be used. 

6.5  Pilot site: Duzlercami forest, Turkey 

6.5.1  Most important goods and services  

The main goods and services provided by the forest of Duzlercami forest are: 

Direct use values: about 20% of the area is tourism and recreation activities benefit visitors, but are also important 
for the local population. It is expected that these services will be even more important in the future. Furthermore, 
there are also other products that are extracted from this forest:  

 
 

 

Fodder and forage, which benefits the local population and is obtained from about 20% of the area; 
Fuelwood  extraction,  undertaken  on  the  whole  pilot  site  area  and  benefits  the  local  population,  but  is 
thought to be of decreasing importance; 
Extraction of industrial wood that is undertaken on a small part of the forest (5%) and benefits the forest 
administration and the local population.  

95 

 

 

Indirect use values: Water related services (water cycle regulation) and carbon sequestration are provided on the 
whole pilot site area, while soil protection is provided on approximately 20% of the site. While water and soil related 
mainly benefit the local rural and urban population, is the carbon sequestration important for the whole society and 
wider. All of these services are considered of increasing importance.  

Non-use  values:  the area has a high biodiversity value with a wildlife protection area, a seed orchard, and counts 
with a rich diversity of endemic and endangered plant species. These values are provided on 75% of the pilot site and 
are of increasing importance for the whole society. 

6.5.2  Expected changes in the provision of goods and services 

The main drivers that affect the provision of the mentioned goods and services are: 

  Deforestation  due  to  intensive  grazing is expected to stimulate the production of fodder and forage, 
but  threaten  some  species  of  wild  fauna  and  flora,  and  affect  negatively  to  the  soil  protection  and  water 
related issues. Also tourism and timber production would be negatively affected.  
Illegal hunting threatens the protection of wildlife (e.g. fallow deer, wild goats and lynx).  
Intensification of tourism activities, affects negatively the biodiversity protection, specially the flora.  
Implementation of forest and scrubs restoration programme should increase timber production and 
carbon sequestration levels, but it may negatively affect biodiversity levels and water supply.  

 
 
 

  Climate  change  is  mentioned  as  an  overall  driver  that  will  decrease  the  provision  of  all  of  the  above 

mentioned goods and services.  

6.5.3  Recommendation for the valuation of changes in the provision of goods and 

services 

The main environmental and social drivers are expected to have significant impacts on the whole range of goods and 
services provided by the Duzlercami forest (table 6.3). To estimate the economic values of such a wide range of goods 
and services requires the application of very different valuation methods.

As  already  explained  in  previous  cases,  the  economic  value  change  in  provision  of  market  products  (e.g.,  fodder, 
forage, fuel wood and wood) could be estimated with market prices, or in the case of fodder also with replacement 
costs (e.g., costs of replacing the forest fodder with other animal food). 

Also  in  the  case  of  carbon  sequestration  the  economic  value  can  be  assessed  by  using  the  market  price  (carbon 
credits). However, there is considerable uncertainty about these prices and, arguably, the market failure that remains 
within  the  European  trading  scheme  (ETS)  means  that  prices  remain  too  low  to  drive  the  necessary  abatement.  A 
similar situation exists in the non-traded sector where CO2 prices remain too low to incentivise abatement to meet 
targets. Thus, an alternative approach would be to use the social costs of carbon (SCC). SCC is a monetary indicator 
measuring the present value of the global damage caused by an additional tonne of green-house gasses emitted into the 
atmosphere (see Box 6.1). 

In  the  case  of  water  supply  and  purification  and  soil  protection  the  valuation  can  be  performed  with  cost  based 
methods. By applying the replacement cost method, the cost of replacing the lost ecosystem service could be assessed 
(e.g. the replacement of clean tap water by bottled water); while, the damage cost avoided method would consider the 
cost of protection measures (e.g. barriers). 

Biodiversity protection can be valued in different manners, depending which aspects are considered. When considering 
the  benefits  obtained  from  hunting  activities  a  good  proxy  could  be  the  value  of  hunting  permits.  However,  when 
taking into account also other aspects of biodiversity (e.g., existence value, protection of plant species) the value can 
only  be  obtained  by  the  application  of  more  complex  valuation  approaches  (e.g.,  choice  modelling).  In  some  cases, 
when the protection of biodiversity is directly related to recreation and tourism activities, the value of plant and animal 
species  richness  can  be  assessed  using  the  replacement  cost  method  (e.g.,  the  costs  of  replacing  a  plant/animal 
specimen by artificial introduction).  

Finally, recreation and tourism services can be assessed by using market prices for entrance fees or the travel cost 
method, which would enable to consider a more complete range of costs incurred to enjoy the recreation amenities 
of the valued pilot site.

Box 6.1: Social cost of carbon (SCC) 

SCC is a monetary indicator measuring the present value of the global damage caused by an additional tonne of green-
house gasses (GHG) emitted into the atmosphere. The SCC is often used in cost-benefit analysis to measure the value 
of the avoided damages, and thus the benefit of mitigation projects. 

The  SCC  can  be  applied  to  estimate  the  economically  optimal  level  of  pollution.  As  in  many  other  cases  of 
environmental pollution, the optimal level is not zero pollution, as this would be too expensive. Figure 6.1 shows an 
economically optimal level of  abatement measures, based on SCC and marginal abatement costs, would be defined. 
The marginal abatement costs (MAC) are rising as the pollution level is decreasing (on figure 6.1, Mac curve decreases 
as CO2 increases).  

At  the  same  time,  the  higher  the  pollution  level,  the  higher  the  SCC.  Thus,  the  optimal  level  of  pollution  is  found 
where the MCA equals the SCC, which is at pollution level p and abatement costs q. This means, that the costs for 
removing an additional tonne of GHG from the atmosphere are equal to the global economic damage this tonne of 
GHG causes.

Figure 5.8The optimal level of pollution 

The SCC is generally estimated by employing an integrated assessment model, which combines a scientific model of 
global warming with a socio-economic model of the underlying value of the social impacts. In these models, impacts at 
different  times  in  the  future  are  estimated  and  discounted  back  to  present  values  to  find  the  damage  of  a  marginal 
tonne emitted into the atmosphere.  

Numerous studies were conducted to estimate the SCC. For example, Tol (2005)  gathered 103 estimates from 28 
published  studies.  He  estimated  a  probability  density  function  with  a  mean  of  77/tCO2,  and  the  95  percentile  290 
/tCO2  (in  2007  prices).  He  concludes  that  the  marginal  damage  costs  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  are  unlikely  to 
exceed 41 /tCO2, and should realistically be much lower. These significant differences between the estimates reflect 
the  uncertainties  in  the  estimation  of  the  integrated  models  (Guo  and  al.  2005).  These  uncertainties  are  related  to 
scientific,  economic  and  ethical  assumptions  used  in  the  assessment  models,  like  population  and  economic  growth 
projections,  the  damages  associated  to  climate  change,  the  selection  of  the  discount  rate,  method  used  for  the 
valuation of non-market goods and services, etc. For example, Hope (2006) estimated that the main drivers of SCC 
estimates sensitivity are the estimated damages produced under different climate change scenarios and the selection of 
the discount rate.

Author: Raul Brey, Pere Riera, Joan Mogas 
Summary: Application of the choice modelling method to value the forests goods and services of an afforestation 
program in the Northeast of Spain. 
Scenario of valuation:  Increasing  the  total  forest  coverage  in  Catalonia  from  40%  to  50%.  The  additional  10%  of 
forest area would be created at the expense of marginal agricultural land. 
Goods and  services valued:  carbon sequestration, delayed erosion and loss of land productivity, being allowed to 
picnic in the new forests, being allowed to drive cars in the new forests, being allowed to pick mushrooms in the new 
forests. 

 

113 

 

Method used: Choice modelling method 
Data and data collection: Focus groups for the design of the experiments and the identification of the key Goods 
and Services to be valued; elaboration of a questionnaire on afforestation alternatives and costs; random distribution of 
the questionnaires to a stratified sample of 800 individuals from all Catalonia; collection of data made on the basis of 
the questionnaires. 
Results: the results reveal that, on average, individuals would pay 11.79 /person to sequester 68000 tonnes of CO2, 
and 0.12 /person for delaying the loss of land productivity during ten years. Picnic users would pay 6.33 /person for 
being allowed to picnic in the new forests; people who live in rural areas would pay 12.82  for being allowed to pick 
mushrooms in the new forests. On the other hand, individuals would experience a loss in welfare equivalent to -9.67 
/person if car driving were allowed in the new forests.

A. Importance of forest goods and services (G&S) on your pilot site  

In this part of the questionnaire you are asked to provide data on the current importance of the forest goods and services on your pilot site. Forest goods are materials 
removed  from  or  consumed  in  the  forest,  e.g.  wood,  cork,  fodder,  mushrooms.  Forest  services  are  direct  or  indirect  benefits  that  humans  derive  from  forests  such  as 
recreation, amenity, water quality, biodiversity, etc.  

Indicators 

  Forest good / service: list up to 10 most important services/goods on the pilot site in descending order, from the most to the least important (for guidance see list in Annex 

1).  

  Area - % of the pilot site area important for the production/provision of a certain forest good/service.  
  Main beneficiaries   Who is mostly benefiting from the use (direct or indirect) of this forest good/service (1 -Forest owners, 2- forest administration, 3- local rural 

population, 4 - local urban population, 5  visitors, 6  whole society, 7- other, 8  dont know).  

  Trend of demand  how the future demand for a product/service is expected to be (-1  decreasing; 0  constant; +1  increasing). 
  Remarks  add all information you consider useful to complete and clarify the data reported (e.g. details of product or services most valued, e.g. pine nuts, mushrooms or 

honey within the "Food" category, wildlife watching within the "Tourism" category, etc.). 

 

As guidance, an exhaustive list of different forest goods and services is provided in Annex 1 of this questionnaire.

B. Relevant change drivers on the pilot site and their impacts on the provision of forest goods and services  

Economic valuation techniques aimed at valuing forest goods and services do not value goods and services per se, but assess changes in the current situation and how these 
changes would affect the provision of the relevant ecosystem services. These changes in provision can be driven by a wide array of factors, such as biophysical effects of the 
climate change, changes in the legislation or the ownership status, demographic and socioeconomic processes, management policies, pressures from industrial or commercial 
sectors, etc.  

Hence, to be able to develop relevant valuation methodologies  for the pilot site in your country, we kindly ask you to provide information on the most relevant drivers of 
change that can be expected on your countrys pilot site (already existing or foreseen), and how these would affect the provision of relevant forest goods and services. In 
order to gather all this information from your pilot site, please complete the table you will find in the next page. Definitions of each of the rows are provided here below:  

  Main  drivers  affecting  the  provision:  specify  the  main  forces  that  are  likely  to  jeopardise  or  enhance  the  sustainable  provision  of  the  goods  and  services 

previously identified (in part A). Please, consider only those affecting the pilot site and its surroundings 

  Main goods and services influenced: among the goods and services provided by the forests, we ask you to list those which, under a certain change, would be 

 

the most affected, either positively or negatively. Only up to three goods and services can be specified per change.  
Impact  on  the  G&S  provision: together with the good or service affected, you should also define whether the provision is expected to be affected positively 
(increased provision), negatively (decreased provision) or neutrally (unchanged provision).  

  Remarks:  add all information you consider needed to clarify/complement the data reported.

Remarks 

The tree  layer  is  expected  to  decrease  due  to  the  agricultural 
pressure  on  the  forest.  The  rangeland  will  likely  increase, 
providing suitable fodder, but species linked to the forest humid 
environments are more likely to decrease/disappear. 
This process is intimately linked to the land use: high levels of 
grazing  and  ploughing  contribute  to  erosion  and  reduce  the 
capacity  of  forests  to  retain  water.  On  the  other  hand,  open 
forest cover is less likely to suffer from severe wildfires. 
Increase of recreational activities will attract visitors. Aesthetics 
will be very relevant. Locals will make their living out of it and 
hence,  the  pressures  on  forests  resources  are  expected  to 
decrease, while traditional forest activities are also expected to 
disappear, entailing a loss of local knowledge. 
This  change  in  legislation  seeks  to  increase  the  quality  and 
protection  of  forests  as  a  touristic  value.  It  is  linked  to  a 
touristic development program. A great effort will be done on 
reducing  forest  fires  in  order  to  increase  the  security  of  the 
visitors and the durability of the resource.

C. Data availability 

The definition of the valuation methodologies to be applied on selected pilot sites will also strongly depend on the data availability. In this section you are asked to provide 
information about existing data and potential data sources concerning your pilot site.  

In the following table you are asked to provide information about: 

Forest good / service  list the relevant forest goods and services, which you identified as important on the pilot site in Section A. 

Indicator for quantification of good/service   Specify, which data are available for your pilot site that could be used to define the quantity (in physical units) of a good/service 
provided on the pilot site. For example the annual production of wood can be measured in m3 per hectare per year. See Annex 2 for some further examples. 

Indicator for economic valuation of good/service   Specify, which data are available for your pilot site that could be used to define the economic value (in monetary units) of a 
good/service provided on the pilot site. For, example the value of wood can be measured by the market price for wood (e.g., EURO per m3). See Annex 2 for some further 
examples. 

Remarks -  Add any information you consider useful to clarify the data reported (e.g., bibliographic source, geographic scale, year of data collection)
