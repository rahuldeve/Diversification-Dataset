CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

T

he most prominent specification for wireless LANs was developed by
the IEEE 802.11 working group. We look first at the overall architecture of
IEEE 802 standards and then at the specifics of IEEE 802.11.

14.1 IEEE 802 ARCHITECTURE
The architecture of a LAN is best described in terms of a layering of protocols that
organize the basic functions of a LAN. This section opens with a description of the
standardized protocol architecture for LANs, which encompasses physical, medium
access control, and logical link control layers. We then look in more detail at
medium access control and logical link control.

Protocol Architecture
Protocols defined specifically for LAN and MAN (metropolitan area network)
transmission address issues relating to the transmission of blocks of data over the
network. In OSI terms, higher-layer protocols (layer 3 or 4 and above) are independent of network architecture and are applicable to LANs, MANs, and WANs.
Thus, a discussion of LAN protocols is concerned principally with lower layers of
the OSI model.
Figure 14.1 relates the LAN protocols to the OSI architecture (Figure 4.3).
This architecture was developed by the IEEE 802 committee and has been adopted
by all organizations working on the specification of LAN standards. It is generally
referred to as the IEEE 802 reference model.1
Working from the bottom up, the lowest layer of the IEEE 802 reference model
corresponds to the physical layer of the OSI model and includes such functions as
• Encoding/decoding of signals
• Preamble generation/removal (for synchronization)
• Bit transmission/reception
In addition, the physical layer of the 802 model includes a specification of the transmission medium and the topology. Generally, this is considered “below” the lowest
layer of the OSI model. However, the choice of transmission medium and topology
is critical in LAN design, and so a specification of the medium is included.
Above the physical layer are the functions associated with providing service to
LAN users. These include the following:
• On transmission, assemble data into a frame with address and error detection fields.
• On reception, disassemble frame, and perform address recognition and error
detection.

IEEE 802 Protocol Layers Compared to OSI Model

• Govern access to the LAN transmission medium.
• Provide an interface to higher layers and perform flow and error control.
These are functions typically associated with OSI layer 2. The set of functions
in the last bullet item are grouped into a logical link control (LLC) layer. The functions in the first three bullet items are treated as a separate layer, called medium
access control (MAC). The separation is done for the following reasons:
• The logic required to manage access to a shared-access medium is not found
in traditional layer 2 data link control.
• For the same LLC, several MAC options may be provided.
Figure 14.2, which reproduces Figure 11.16, illustrates the relationship between the levels of the architecture. Higher-level data are passed down to LLC,
which appends control information as a header, creating an LLC protocol data unit
(PDU). This control information is used in the operation of the LLC protocol. The
entire LLC PDU is then passed down to the MAC layer, which appends control
information at the front and back of the packet, forming a MAC frame. Again, the
control information in the frame is needed for the operation of the MAC protocol.
For context, the figure also shows the use of TCP/IP and an application layer above
the LAN protocols.

MAC Frame Format
The MAC layer receives a block of data from the LLC layer and is responsible for
performing functions related to medium access and for transmitting the data. As
with other protocol layers, MAC implements these functions making use of a protocol data unit at its layer. In this case, the PDU is referred to as a MAC frame.
The exact format of the MAC frame differs somewhat for the various MAC
protocols in use. In general, all of the MAC frames have a format similar to that of
Figure 14.3. The fields of this frame are as follows:
• MAC control: This field contains any protocol control information needed for
the functioning of the MAC protocol. For example, a priority level could be
indicated here.
• Destination MAC address: The destination physical attachment point on the
LAN for this frame.
• Source MAC address: The source physical attachment point on the LAN for
this frame.
• Data: The body of the MAC frame. This may be LLC data from the next higher
layer or control information relevant to the operatoin of the MAC protocol.
• CRC: The cyclic redundancy check field (also known as the frame check
sequence, FCS, field). This is an error-detecting code, as we have seen in HDLC
and other data link control protocols (Section 8.1).
In most data link control protocols, the data link protocol entity is responsible
not only for detecting errors using the CRC but for recovering from those errors by
retransmitting damaged frames. In the LAN protocol architecture, these two functions are split between the MAC and LLC layers. The MAC layer is responsible for
detecting errors and discarding any frames that are in error. The LLC layer optionally keeps track of which frames have been successfully received and retransmits
unsuccessful frames.

Logical Link Control
The LLC layer for LANs is similar in many respects to other link layers in common
use. Like all link layers, LLC is concerned with the transmission of a link-level PDU
between two stations, without the necessity of an intermediate switching node. LLC
has two characteristics not shared by most other link control protocols:
1. It must support the multiaccess, shared-medium nature of the link (this differs
from a multidrop line in that there is no primary node).
2. It is relieved of some details of link access by the MAC layer.
Addressing in LLC involves specifying the source and destination LLC users.
Typically, a user is a higher-layer protocol or a network management function in the
station. These LLC user addresses are referred to as service access points (SAPs),
in keeping with OSI terminology for the user of a protocol layer.
We look first at the services that LLC provides to a higher-level user, and then
at the LLC protocol.

LLC Services
LLC specifies the mechanisms for addressing stations across the medium and
for controlling the exchange of data between two users. The operation and format
of this standard is based on HDLC. Three services are provided as alternatives for
attached devices using LLC:
• Unacknowledged connectionless service: This service is a datagram-style service. It is a very simple service that does not involve any of the flow- and errorcontrol mechanisms. Thus, the delivery of data is not guaranteed. However, in
most devices, there will be some higher layer of software that deals with reliability issues.
• Connection-mode service: This service is similar to that offered by HDLC. A
logical connection is set up between two users exchanging data, and flow control and error control are provided.
• Acknowledged connectionless service: This is a cross between the previous
two services. It provides that datagrams are to be acknowledged, but no prior
logical connection is set up.
Typically, a vendor will provide these services as options that the customer can
select when purchasing the equipment. Alternatively, the customer can purchase
equipment that provides two or all three services and select a specific service based
on application.
The unacknowledged connectionless service requires minimum logic and is
useful in two contexts. First, it will often be the case that higher layers of software
will provide the necessary reliability and flow-control mechanism, and it is efficient
to avoid duplicating them. For example, TCP could provide the mechanisms needed
to ensure that data are delivered reliably. Second, there are instances in which the
overhead of connection establishment and maintenance is unjustified or even
counterproductive (for example, data collection activities that involve the periodic
sampling of data sources, such as sensors and automatic self-test reports from security equipment or network components). In a monitoring application, the loss of
an occasional data unit would not cause distress, as the next report should arrive
shortly. Thus, in most cases, the unacknowledged connectionless service is the preferred option.
The connection-mode service could be used in very simple devices, such as terminal controllers, that have little software operating above this level. In these cases,
it would provide the flow control and reliability mechanisms normally implemented
at higher layers of the communications software.
The acknowledged connectionless service is useful in several contexts. With the
connection-mode service, the logical link control software must maintain some sort
of table for each active connection, to keep track of the status of that connection. If
the user needs guaranteed delivery but there are a large number of destinations for
data, then the connection-mode service may be impractical because of the large
number of tables required. An example is a process control or automated factory
environment where a central site may need to communicate with a large number
of processors and programmable controllers. Another use of this is the handling of

14 StallingsIII

CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

important and time-critical alarm or emergency control signals in a factory. Because
of their importance, an acknowledgment is needed so that the sender can be assured
that the signal got through. Because of the urgency of the signal, the user might not
want to take the time first to establish a logical connection and then send the data.
LLC Protocol
The basic LLC protocol is modeled after HDLC and has similar functions and
formats. The differences between the two protocols can be summarized as follows:
• LLC makes use of the asynchronous balanced mode of operation of HDLC,
to support connection-mode LLC service; this is referred to as type 2 operation. The other HDLC modes are not employed.
• LLC supports an unacknowledged connectionless service using the unnumbered information PDU; this is known as type 1 operation.
• LLC supports an acknowledged connectionless service by using two new
unnumbered PDUs; this is known as type 3 operation.
• LLC permits multiplexing by the use of LLC service access points (LSAPs).
All three LLC protocols employ the same PDU format (Figure 14.3), which
consists of four fields. The DSAP and SSAP fields each contain a 7-bit address,
which specify the destination and source users of LLC. One bit of the DSAP indicates whether the DSAP is an individual or group address. One bit of the SSAP
indicates whether the PDU is a command or response PDU. The format of the LLC
control field is identical to that of HDLC (Figure D.1, Appendix D), using extended
(7-bit) sequence numbers.
For type 1 operation, which supports the unacknowledged connectionless service, the unnumbered information (UI) PDU is used to transfer user data. There is
no acknowledgment, flow control, or error control. However, there is error detection and discard at the MAC level.
Two other PDU types, XID and TEST, are used to support management
functions associated with all three types of operation. Both PDU types are used in
the following fashion. An LLC entity may issue a command (C/R bit  0) XID or
TEST. The receiving LLC entity issues a corresponding XID or TEST in response.
The XID PDU is used to exchange two types of information: types of operation supported and window size. The TEST PDU is used to conduct a loopback test of the
transmission path between two LLC entities. Upon receipt of a TEST command
PDU, the addressed LLC entity issues a TEST response PDU as soon as possible.
With type 2 operation, a data link connection is established between two LLC
SAPs prior to data exchange. Connection establishment is attempted by the type 2
protocol in response to a request from a user. The LLC entity issues a SABME
PDU2 to request a logical connection with the other LLC entity. If the connection is
accepted by the LLC user designated by the DSAP, then the destination LLC entity
returns an unnumbered acknowledgment (UA) PDU. The connection is henceforth

2

This stands for Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode Extended. It is used in HDLC to choose ABM and
to select extended sequence numbers of 7 bits. Both ABM and 7-bit sequence numbers are mandatory
in type 2 operation.

uniquely identified by the pair of user SAPs. If the destination LLC user rejects the
connection request, its LLC entity returns a disconnected mode (DM) PDU.
Once the connection is established, data is exchanged using information
PDUs, as in HDLC. The information PDUs include send and receive sequence
numbers, for sequencing and flow control. The supervisory PDUs are used, as in
HDLC, for flow control and error control. Either LLC entity can terminate a logical LLC connection by issuing a disconnect (DISC) PDU.
With type 3 operation, each transmitted PDU is acknowledged. A new (not
found in HDLC) unnumbered PDU, the acknowledged connectionless (AC) information PDU, is defined. User data are sent in AC command PDUs and must be
acknowledged using an AC response PDU. To guard against lost PDUs, a 1-bit
sequence number is used. The sender alternates the use of 0 and 1 in its AC command PDU, and the receiver responds with an AC PDU with the opposite number
of the corresponding command. Only one PDU in each direction may be outstanding at any time.

14.2 IEEE 802.11 ARCHITECTURE AND SERVICES
Work on wireless LANs within the IEEE 802 committee began in 1987 within the
IEEE 802.4 group. The initial interest was in developing an ISM-based wireless
LAN using the equivalent of a token-passing bus MAC protocol. After some work,
it was decided that token bus was not suitable for controlling a radio medium without causing inefficient use of the radio frequency spectrum. IEEE 802 then decided
in 1990 to form a new working group, IEEE 802.11, specifically devoted to wireless
LANs, with a charter to develop a MAC protocol and physical medium specification. Table 14.1 briefly defines key terms used in the IEEE 802.11 standard.

CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

IEEE 802.11 Architecture
Figure 14.4 illustrates the model developed by the 802.11 working group. The smallest building block of a wireless LAN is a basic service set (BSS), which consists of
some number of stations executing the same MAC protocol and competing for
access to the same shared wireless medium. A BSS may be isolated or it may connect to a backbone distribution system (DS) through an access point (AP). The
access point functions as a bridge. The MAC protocol may be fully distributed or
controlled by a central coordination function housed in the access point. The BSS
generally corresponds to what is referred to as a cell in the literature. The DS can
be a switch, a wired network, or a wireless network.
The simplest configuration is shown in Figure 14.4, in which each station
belongs to a single BSS; that is, each station is within wireless range only of other
stations within the same BSS. It is also possible for two BSSs to overlap geographically, so that a single station could pariticipate in more than one BSS. Further, the
association between a station and a BSS is dynamic. Stations may turn off, come
within range, and go out of range.
An extended service set (ESS) consists of two or more basic service sets interconnected by a distribution system. Typically, the distribution system is a wired
backbone LAN but can be any communications network. The extended service set
appears as a single logical LAN to the logical link control (LLC) level.
Figure 14.4 indicates that an access point (AP) is implemented as part of a station; the AP is the logic within a station that provides access to the DS by providing
DS services in addition to acting as a station. To integrate the IEEE 802.11 architecture with a traditional wired LAN, a portal is used. The portal logic is imple-

mented in a device, such as a bridge or router, that is part of the wired LAN and
that is attached to the DS.

IEEE 802.11 Services
IEEE 802.11 defines nine services that need to be provided by the wireless LAN to
provide functionality equivalent to that which is inherent to wired LANs. Table 14.2
lists the services and indicates two ways of categorizing them.
1. The service provider can be either the station or the distribution system (DS).
Station services are implemented in every 802.11 station, including access
point (AP) stations. Distribition services are provided between basic service
sets (BSSs); these services may be implemented in an AP or in another special-purpose device attaced to the distribution system.
2. Three of the services are used to control IEEE 802.11 LAN access and confidentiality. Six of the services are used to support delivery of MAC service data
units (MSDUs) between stations. The MSDU is a the block of data passed
down from the MAC user to the MAC layer; typically this is a LLC PDU. If
the MSDU is too large to be transmitted in a single MAC frame, it may be
fragmented and transmitted in a series of MAC frames. Fragmentation is discussed in Section 14.3.
Following the IEEE 802.11 document, we next discuss the services in an order
designed to clarify the operation of an IEEE 802.11 ESS network. MSDU delivery,
which is the basic service, has already been mentioned.
Distribution of Messages Within a DS
The two services involved with the distribution of messages within a DS are
distribution and integration. Distribution is the primary service used by stations to
exchange MAC frames when the frame must traverse the DS to get from a station
in one BSS to a station in another BSS. For example, suppose a frame is to be sent

from station 2 (STA 2) to STA 7 in Figure 14.4. The frame is sent from STA 2 to
STA 1, which is the AP for this BSS. The AP gives the frame to the DS, which has
the job of directing the frame to the AP associated with STA 5 in the target BSS.
STA 5 receives the frame and forwards it to STA 7. How the message is transported
through the DS is beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.11 standard.
If the two stations that are communicating are within the same BSS, then the
distribution service logically goes through the single AP of that BSS.
The integration service enables transfer of data between a station on an IEEE
802.11 LAN and a station on an integrated IEEE 802.x LAN. The term integrated
refers to a wired LAN that is physically connected to the DS and whose stations may
be logically connected to an IEEE 802.11 LAN via the integration service. The integration service takes care of any address translation and media conversion logic
required for the exchange of data.
Association-Related Services
The primary purpose of the MAC layer is to transfer MSDUs between MAC
entities; this purpose is fulfilled by the distribution service. For that service to function, it requires information about stations within the ESS that is provided by the
association-related services. Before the distribution service can deliver data to or
accept data from a station, that station must be associated. Before looking at the
concept of association, we need to describe the concept of mobility. The standard
defines three transition types of based on mobility:
• No transition: A station of this type is either stationary or moves only within
the direct communication range of the communicating stations of a single BSS.
• BSS transition: This is defined as a station movement from one BSS to
another BSS within the same ESS. In this case, delivery of data to the station
requires that the addressing capability be able to recognize the new location
of the station.
• ESS transition: This is defined as a station movement from a BSS in one ESS
to a BSS within another ESS. This case is supported only in the sense that the
station can move. Maintenance of upper-layer connections supported by
802.11 cannot be guaranteed. In fact, disruption of service is likely to occur.
To deliver a message within a DS, the distribution service needs to know
where the destination station is located. Specifically, the DS needs to know the identity of the AP to which the message should be delivered in order for that message
to reach the destination station. To meet this requirement, a station must maintain
an association with the AP within its current BSS. Three services relate to this
requirement:
• Association: Establishes an initial association between a station and an AP.
Before a station can transmit or receive frames on a wireless LAN, its identity
and address must be known. For this purpose, a station must establish an association with an AP within a particular BSS. The AP can then communicate this
information to other APs within the ESS to facilitate routing and delivery of
addressed frames.

461

• Reassociation: Enables an established association to be transferred from one
AP to another, allowing a mobile station to move from one BSS to another.
• Disassociation: A notification from either a station or an AP that an existing
association is terminated. A station should give this notification before leaving an ESS or shutting down. However, the MAC management facility protects itself against stations that disappear without notification.
Access and Privacy Services
There are two characteristics of a wired LAN that are not inherent in a wireless LAN.
1. In order to transmit over a wired LAN, a station must be physically connected
to the LAN. On the other hand, with a wireless LAN, any station within radio
range of the other devices on the LAN can transmit. In a sense, there is a form
of authentication with a wired LAN, in that it requires some positive and presumably observable action to connect a station to a wired LAN.
2. Similarly, in order to receive a transmission from a station that is part of a
wired LAN, the receiving station must also be attached to the wired LAN.
On the other hand, with a wireless LAN, any station within radio range can
receive. Thus, a wired LAN provides a degree of privacy, limiting reception of
data to stations connected to the LAN.
IEEE 802.11 defines three services that provide a wireless LAN with these
two features:
• Authentication: Used to establish the identity of stations to each other. In a wired
LAN, it is generally assumed that access to a physical connection conveys
authority to connect to the LAN. This is not a valid assumption for a wireless
LAN, in which connectivity is achieved simply by having an attached antenna
that is properly tuned. The authentication service is used by stations to establish their identity with stations they wish to communicate with. IEEE 802.11
supports several authentication schemes and allows for expansion of the functionality of these schemes. The standard does not mandate any particular authentication scheme, which could range from relatively unsecure handshaking
to public-key encryption schemes. However, IEEE 802.11 requires mutually
acceptable, successful authentication before a station can establish an association with an AP.
• Deathentication: This service is invoked whenever an existing authentication
is to be terminated.
• Privacy: Used to prevent the contents of messages from being read by other
than the intended recipient. The standard provides for the optional use of
encryption to assure privacy. The algorithm specified in the standard is WEP,
which is described in Section 14.3.

CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

14.3 IEEE 802.11 MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL
The IEEE 802.11 MAC layer covers three functional areas: reliable data delivery,
access control, and security. We look at each of these in turn.

Reliable Data Delivery
As with any wireless network, a wireless LAN using the IEEE 802.11 physical and
MAC layers is subject to considerable unreliability. Noise, interference, and other
propagation effects result in the loss of a significant number of frames. Even with
error-correction codes, a number of MAC frames may not successfully be received.
This situation can be dealt with by reliability mechanisms at a higher layer, such as
TCP. However, timers used for retransmission at higher layers are typically on the
order of seconds. It is therefore more efficient to deal with errors at the MAC level.
For this purpose, IEEE 802.11 includes a frame exchange protocol. When a station
receives a data frame from another station it returns an acknowledgment (ACK)
frame to the source station. This exchange is treated as an atomic unit, not to be
interrupted by a transmission from any other station. If the source does not receive
an ACK within a short period of time, either because its data frame was damaged
or because the returning ACK was damaged, the source retransmits the frame.
Thus, the basic data transfer mechanism in IEEE 802.11 involves an exchange
of two frames. To further enhance reliability, a four-frame exchange may be used.
In this scheme, a source first issues a request to send (RTS) frame to the destination. The destination then responds with a clear to send (CTS). After receiving the
CTS, the source transmits the data frame, and the destination responds with an
ACK. The RTS alerts all stations that are within reception range of the source that
an exchange is under way; these stations refrain from transmission in order to avoid
a collision between two frames transmitted at the same time. Similarly, the CTS
alerts all stations that are within reception range of the destination that an exchange
is under way. The RTS/CTS portion of the exchange is a required function of the
MAC but may be disabled.

Access Control
The 802.11 working group considered two types of proposals for a MAC algorithm:
distributed access protocols, which, like Ethernet, distribute the decision to transmit over all the nodes using a carrier-sense mechanism; and centralized access protocols, which involve regulation of transmission by a centralized decision maker. A
distributed access protocol makes sense for an ad hoc network of peer workstations
and may also be attractive in other wireless LAN configurations that consist primarily of bursty traffic. A centralized access protocol is natural for configurations
in which a number of wireless stations are interconnected with each other and some
sort of base station that attaches to a backbone wired LAN; it is especially useful if
some of the data is time sensitive or high priority.
The end result for 802.11 is a MAC algorithm called DFWMAC (distributed
foundation wireless MAC) that provides a distributed access control mechanism
with an optional centralized control built on top of that. Figure 14.5 illustrates the

architecture. The lower sublayer of the MAC layer is the distributed coordination
function (DCF). DCF uses a contention algorithm to provide access to all traffic.
Ordinary asynchronous traffic directly uses DCF. The point coordination function
(PCF) is a centralized MAC algorithm used to provide contention-free service. PCF
is built on top of DCF and exploits features of DCF to assure access for its users.
Let us consider these two sublayers in turn.
Distributed Coordination Function
The DCF sublayer makes use of a simple CSMA (carrier sense multiple
access) algorithm. If a station has a MAC frame to transmit, it listens to the medium.
If the medium is idle, the station may transmit; otherwise the station must wait until
the current transmission is complete before transmitting. The DCF does not include
a collision detection function (i.e., CSMA/CD) because collision detection is not
practical on a wireless network. The dynamic range of the signals on the medium is
very large, so that a transmitting station cannot effectively distinguish incoming
weak signals from noise and the effects of its own transmission.
To ensure the smooth and fair functioning of this algorithm, DCF includes a
set of delays that amounts to a priority scheme. Let us start by considering a single
delay known as an interframe space (IFS). In fact, there are three different IFS values, but the algorithm is best explained by initially ignoring this detail. Using an IFS,
the rules for CSMA access are as follows (Figure 14.6):

1. A station with a frame to transmit senses the medium. If the medium is idle,
it waits to see if the medium remains idle for a time equal to IFS. If so, the station may transmit immediately.
2. If the medium is busy (either because the station initially finds the medium
busy or because the medium becomes busy during the IFS idle time), the station defers transmission and continues to monitor the medium until the current transmission is over.
3. Once the current transmission is over, the station delays another IFS. If the
medium remains idle for this period, then the station backs off a random
amount of time and again senses the medium. If the medium is still idle, the
station may transmit. During the backoff time, if the medium becomes busy,
the backoff timer is halted and resumes when the medium becomes idle.

14.3 / IEEE 802.11 MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL

To ensure that backoff maintains stability, a technique known as binary exponential backoff is used. A station will attempt to transmit repeatedly in the face of
repeated collisions, but after each collision, the mean value of the random delay is
doubled. The binary exponential backoff provides a means of handling a heavy load.
Repeated failed attempts to transmit result in longer and longer backoff times, which
helps to smooth out the load. Without such a backoff, the following situation could
occur. Two or more stations attempt to transmit at the same time, causing a collision. These stations then immediately attempt to retransmit, causing a new collision.
The preceding scheme is refined for DCF to provide priority-based access by
the simple expedient of using three values for IFS:
• SIFS (short IFS): The shortest IFS, used for all immediate response actions, as
explained in the following discussion
• PIFS (point coordination function IFS): A midlength IFS, used by the centralized controller in the PCF scheme when issuing polls
• DIFS (distributed coordination function IFS): The longest IFS, used as a minimum delay for asynchronous frames contending for access
Figure 14.7a illustrates the use of these time values. Consider first the SIFS. Any
station using SIFS to determine transmission opportunity has, in effect, the highest

priority, because it will always gain access in preference to a station waiting an amount
of time equal to PIFS or DIFS. The SIFS is used in the following circumstances:
• Acknowledgment (ACK): When a station receives a frame addressed only to
itself (not multicast or broadcast) it responds with an ACK frame after waiting only for an SIFS gap. This has two desirable effects. First, because collision detection is not used, the likelihood of collisions is greater than with
CSMA/CD, and the MAC-level ACK provides for efficient collision recovery.
Second, the SIFS can be used to provide efficient delivery of an LLC protocol
data unit (PDU) that requires multiple MAC frames. In this case, the following scenario occurs. A station with a multiframe LLC PDU to transmit sends
out the MAC frames one at a time. Each frame is acknowledged after SIFS by
the recipient. When the source receives an ACK, it immediately (after SIFS)
sends the next frame in the sequence. The result is that once a station has contended for the channel, it will maintain control of the channel until it has sent
all of the fragments of an LLC PDU.
• Clear to Send (CTS): A station can ensure that its data frame will get through
by first issuing a small Request to Send (RTS) frame. The station to which this
frame is addressed should immediately respond with a CTS frame if it is ready
to receive. All other stations receive the RTS and defer using the medium.
• Poll response: This is explained in the following discussion of PCF.
The next longest IFS interval is the PIFS. This is used by the centralized controller in issuing polls and takes precedence over normal contention traffic. However, those frames transmitted using SIFS have precedence over a PCF poll.
Finally, the DIFS interval is used for all ordinary asynchronous traffic.
Point Coordination Function
PCF is an alternative access method implemented on top of the DCF. The
operation consists of polling by the centralized polling master (point coordinator).
The point coordinator makes use of PIFS when issuing polls. Because PIFS is
smaller than DIFS, the point coordinator can seize the medium and lock out all
asynchronous traffic while it issues polls and receives responses.
As an extreme, consider the following possible scenario. A wireless network
is configured so that a number of stations with time-sensitive traffic are controlled
by the point coordinator while remaining traffic contends for access using CSMA.
The point coordinator could issue polls in a round-robin fashion to all stations configured for polling. When a poll is issued, the polled station may respond using
SIFS. If the point coordinator receives a response, it issues another poll using PIFS.
If no response is received during the expected turnaround time, the coordinator
issues a poll.
If the discipline of the preceding paragraph were implemented, the point coordinator would lock out all asynchronous traffic by repeatedly issuing polls. To prevent this, an interval known as the superframe is defined. During the first part of
this interval, the point coordinator issues polls in a round-robin fashion to all stations configured for polling. The point coordinator then idles for the remainder of the
superframe, allowing a contention period for asynchronous access.

467

Figure 14.7b illustrates the use of the superframe. At the beginning of a superframe, the point coordinator may optionally seize control and issues polls for a give
period of time. This interval varies because of the variable frame size issued by
responding stations. The remainder of the superframe is available for contentionbased access. At the end of the superframe interval, the point coordinator contends
for access to the medium using PIFS. If the medium is idle, the point coordinator
gains immediate access and a full superframe period follows. However, the medium
may be busy at the end of a superframe. In this case, the point coordinator must wait
until the medium is idle to gain access; this results in a foreshortened superframe
period for the next cycle.

MAC Frame
Figure 14.8a shows the 802.11 frame format. This general format is used for all data
and control frames, but not all fields are used in all contexts. The fields are as follows:
• Frame control: Indicates the type of frame and provides control information,
as explained presently.
• Duration/connection ID: If used as a duration field, indicates the time (in
microseconds) the channel will be allocated for successful transmission of a
MAC frame. In some control frames, this field contains an association, or connection, identifier.

CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

• Addresses: The number and meaning of the address fields depend on context. Address types include source, destination, transmitting station, and
receiving station.
• Sequence control: Contains a 4-bit fragment number subfield, used for fragmentation and reassembly, and a 12-bit sequence number used to number
frames sent between a given transmitter and receiver.
• Frame body: Contains an MSDU or a fragment of an MSDU. The MSDU is a
LLC protocol data unit or MAC control information.
• Frame check sequence: A 32-bit cyclic redundancy check.
The frame control field, shown in Figure 14.8b, consists of the following fields:
• Protocol version: 802.11 version, currently version 0.
• Type: Identifies the frame as control, management, or data.
• Subtype: Further identifies the function of frame. Table 14.3 Defines the valid
combinations of type and subtype.
• To DS: The MAC coordination sets this bit to 1 in a frame destined to the distribution system.
• From DS: The MAC coordination sets this bit to 1 in a frame leaving the distribution system.
• More fragments: Set to 1 if more fragments follow this one.
• Retry: Set to 1 if this is a retransmission of a previous frame.
• Power management: Set to 1 if the transmitting station is in a sleep mode.
• More data: Indicates that a station has additional data to send. Each block of
data may be sent as one frame or a group of fragments in multiple frames.
• WEP: Set to 1 if the optional wired equivalent protocol is implemented. WEP
is used in the exchange of encryption keys for secure data exchange.
• Order: Set to 1 in any data frame sent using the Strictly Ordered service, which
tells the receiving station that frames must be processed in order.
We now look at the various MAC frame types.
Control Frames
Control frames assist in the reliable delivery of data frames. There are six control frame subtypes:
• Power save-poll (PS-Poll): This frame is sent by any station to the station that
includes the AP (access point). Its purpose is to request that the AP transmit
a frame that has been buffered for this station while the station was in powersaving mode.
• Request to send (RTS): This is the first frame in the four-way frame exchange
discussed under the subsection on reliable data delivery at the beginning of
Section 14.3. The station sending this message is alerting a potential destination, and all other stations within reception range, that it intends to send a data
frame to that destination.

CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

• CF-end  CF-ack: Acknowledges the CF-end. This frame ends the contention-free period and releases stations from the restrictions associated with
that period.
Data Frames
There are eight data frame subtypes, organized into two groups. The first four
subtypes define frames that carry upper-level data from the source station to the
destination station. The four data-carrying frames are as follows:
• Data: This is the simplest data frame. It may be used in both a contention
period and a contention-free period.
• Data  CF-Ack: May only be sent during a contention-free period. In addition to carrying data, this frame acknowledges previously received data.
• Data  CF-Poll: Used by a point coordinator to deliver data to a mobile station and also to request that the mobile station send a data frame that it may
have buffered.
• Data  CF-Ack  CF-Poll: Combines the functions of the Data  CF-Ack
and Data  CF-Poll into a single frame.
The remaining four subtypes of data frames do not in fact carry any user data.
The Null Function data frame carries no data, polls, or acknowledgments. It is used
only to carry the power management bit in the frame control field to the AP, to indicate that the station is changing to a low-power operating state. The remaining three
frames (CF-Ack, CF-Poll, CF-Ack  CF-Poll) have the same functionality as the
corresponding data frame subtypes in the preceding list (Data  CF-Ack, Data 
CF-Poll, Data  CF-Ack  CF-Poll) but without the data.
Management Frames
Management frames are used to manage communications between stations
and APs. The following subtypes are included:
• Association request: Sent by a station to an AP to request an association with
this BSS. This frame includes capability information, such as whether encryption is to be used and whether this station is pollable.
• Association response: Returned by the AP to the station to indicate whether
it is accepting this association request.
• Reassociation request: Sent by a station when it moves from one BSS to
another and needs to make an association with the AP in the new BSS. The
station uses reassociation rather than simply association so that the new AP
knows to negotiate with the old AP for the forwarding of data frames.
• Reassociation response: Returned by the AP to the station to indicate whether
it is accepting this reassociation request.
• Probe request: Used by a station to obtain information from another station
or AP. This frame is used to locate an IEEE 802.11 BSS.

471

• Probe response: Response to a probe request.
• Beacon: Transmitted periodically to allow mobile stations to locate and identify a BSS.
• Announcement traffic indication message: Sent by a mobile station to alert
other mobile stations that may have been in low power mode that this station
has frames buffered and waiting to be delivered to the station addressed in
this frame.
• Dissociation: Used by a station to terminate an association.
• Authentication: Multiple authentication frames are used in an exchange to
authenticate one station to another, as described subsequently.
• Deauthentication: Sent by a station to another station or AP to indicate that
it is terminating secure communications.

Security Considerations
IEEE 802.11 provides both privacy and authentication mechanisms.
The Wired Equivalent Privacy Algorithm
With a wireless LAN, eavesdropping is a major concern because of the ease
of capturing a transmission. IEEE 802.11 incorporates WEP to provide a modest
level of security. To provide privacy, as well as data integrity, WEP uses an encryption algorithm based on the RC4 encryption algorithm.
Figure 14.9a shows the encryption process. The integrity algorithm is simply
the 32-bit CRC that is appended to the end of the MAC frame (Figure 14.8a). For
the encryption process, a 40-bit secret key is shared by the two participants in the
exchange. An initialization vector (IV) is concatenated to the secret key. The resulting block forms the seed that is input to the pseudorandom number generator
(PRNG) defined in RC4. The PRNG generates a bit sequence of the same length
as the MAC frame plus its CRC. A bit-by-bit exclusive-OR between the MAC
frame and the PRNG sequence produces the ciphertext. The IV is attached to the
ciphertext and the resulting block is transmitted. The IV is changed periodically (as
often as every transmission). Every time the IV is changed, the PRNG sequence is
changed, which complicates the task of an eavesdropper.
At the receiving end (Figure 14.9b), the receiver retrieves the IV from the
data block and concatenates this with the shared secret key to generate the same
key sequence used by the sender. This key sequence is then XORed with the incoming block to recover the plaintext. This technique makes use of the following property of XOR:
A⊕B⊕BA
Thus, if we take the plaintext, XOR it with the key sequence, and then XOR the
result with the key sequence, we get back the plaintext. Finally, the receiver compares the incoming CRC with the CRC calculated at the receiver to validate integrity.

473

Authentication
IEEE 802.11 provides two types of authentication: open system and shared
key. Open system authentication simply provides a way for two parties to agree to
exchange data and provides no security benefits. In open system authentication,
one party sends a MAC control frame, known as an authentication frame, to the other
party. The frame indicates that this is an open system authentication type. The
other party responds with its own authentication frame and the process is complete.
Thus, open system authentication consists simply of the exchange of the identities
between the parties.
Shared key authentication requires that the two parties share a secret key not
shared by any other party. This key is used to assure that both sides are authenticated to each other. The procedure for authentication between two parties, A and
B, is as follows:
1. A sends a MAC authentication frame with an authentication algorithm identification of “Shared Key” and with a station identifier that identifies the sending station.
2. B responds with an authentication frame that includes a 128-octet challenge
text. The challenge text is generate using the WEP PRNG. The key and IV
used in generating this challenge text are unimportant because they do not
play a role in the remainder of the procedure.
3. A transmits an authentication frame that includes the challenge text just
received from B. The entire frame is encrypted using WEP.
4. B receives the encrypted frame and decrypts it using WEP and the secret key
shared with A. If decryption is successful (matching CRCs), then B compares
the incoming challenge text with the challenge text that it sent in the second
message. B then sends an authentication message to A with a status code indicating success or failure.

14.4 IEEE 802.11 PHYSICAL LAYER
The physical layer for IEEE 802.11 has been issued in three stages; the first part was
issued in 1997 and the remaining two parts in 1999. The first part, simply called
IEEE 802.11, includes the MAC layer and three physical layer specifications, two in
the 2.4-GHz band and one in the infrared, all operating at 1 and 2 Mbps. IEEE
802.11a operates in the 5-GHz band at data rates up to 54 Mbps. IEEE 802.11b
operates in the 2.4-Ghz band at 5.5 and 11 Mbps. We look at each of these in turn.

Original IEEE 802.11 Physical Layer
Three physical media are defined in the original 802.11 standard:

rates of 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps

Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
Up to seven channels, each with a data rate of 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps, can be used
in the DS-SS system. The number of channels available depends on the bandwidth
allocated by the various national regulatory agencies. This ranges from 13 in most
European countries to just one available channel in Japan. Each channel has a bandwidth of 5 Mhz. The encoding scheme that is used is DBPSK for the 1-Mbps rate
and DQPSK for the 2-Mbps rate.
Recall from Chapter 7 that a DS-SS system makes use of a chipping code, or
pseudonoise sequence, to spread the data rate and hence the bandwidth of the signal. For IEEE 802.11, a Barker sequence is used.
A Barker sequence is a binary {1, 1} sequence {s(t)} of length n with the
property that its autocorrelation values R() satisfy |R()|  1 for all ||  (n  1).
Further, the Barker property is preserved under the following transformations.
s(t) → s(t)

s(t) → (1)ts(t)

and

s(t) →  s(n  1  t)

as well as under compositions of these transformations. Only the following Barker
sequences are known:
n 2
n 3
n 4
n 5
n 7
n  11
n  13








The 11-chip Barker sequence is used. Thus, each data binary 1 is mapped into
the sequence {          }, and each binary 0 is mapped into the
sequence {          }.
Important characteristic of Barker sequences are their robustness against
interference and their insensitivity to multipath propagation.
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
Recall from Chapter 7 that a FH-SS system makes use of a multiple channels,
with the signal hopping from one channel to another based on a pseudonoise
sequence. In the case of the IEEE 802.11 scheme, 1-MHz channels are used. The
number of channels available ranges from 23 in Japan to 70 in the United States.
The details of the hopping scheme are adjustable. For example, the minimum
hop rate for the United States is 2.5 hops per second. The minimum hop distance in
frequency is 6 MHz in North America and most of Europe and 5 MHz in Japan.
For modulation, the FH-SS scheme uses two-level Gaussian FSK for the
1-Mbps system. The bits zero and one are encoded as deviations from the current
carrier frequency. For 2 Mbps, a four-level GFSK scheme is used, in which four
different deviations from the center frequency define the four 2-bit combinations.

CHAPTER 14 / IEEE 802.11 WIRELESS LAN STANDARD

Infrared
The IEEE 802.11 infrared scheme is omnidirectional (Figure 13.6) rather than
point to point. A range of up to 20 m is possible. The modulation scheme for the 1Mbps data rate is known as 16-PPM (pulse position modulation). In this scheme,
each group of 4 data bits is mapped into one of the 16-PPM symbols; each symbol
is a string of 16 bits. Each 16-bit string consists of fifteen 0s and one binary 1. For
the 2-Mbps data rate, each group of 2 data bits is mapped into one of four 4-bit
sequences. Each sequence consists of three 0s and one binary 1. The actual transmission uses an intensity modulation scheme, in which the presence of a signal corresponds to a binary 1 and the absence of a signal corresponds to binary 0.

IEEE 802.11a
The IEEE 802.11a specification makes use of the 5-GHz band. Unlike the 2.4-GHz
specifications, IEEE 802.11 does not use a spread spectrum scheme but rather uses
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Recall from Section 11.2 that
OFDM, also called multicarrier modulation, uses multiple carrier signals at different frequencies, sending some of the bits on each channel. This is similar to FDM.
However, in the case of OFDM, all of the subchannels are dedicated to a single
data source.
The possible data rates for IEEE 802.11a are 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps.
The system uses up to 52 subcarriers that are modulated using BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM,
or 64-QAM, depending on the rate required. Subcarrier frequency spacing is 0.3125
MHz. A convolutional code at a rate of 1/2, 2/3, or 3/4 provides forward error correction.

IEEE 802.11b
IEEE 802.11b is an extension of the IEEE 802.11 DS-SS scheme, providing data
rates of 5.5 and 11 Mbps. The chipping rate is 11 MHz, which is the same as the original DS-SS scheme, thus providing the same occupied bandwidth. To achieve a
higher data rate in the same bandwidth at the same chipping rate, a modulation
scheme known as complementary code keying (CCK) is used.
The CCK modulation scheme is quite complex and is not examined in detail here.
Figure 14.10 provides an overview of the scheme for the 11-Mbps rate. Input data are

treated in blocks of 8 bits at a rate of 1.375 MHz (8 bits/symbol  1.375 MHz  11
Mbps). Six of these bits are mapped into one of 64 codes sequences based on the
use of the 8  8 Walsh matrix (Figure 7.17). The output of the mapping, plus the
two additional bits, forms the input to a QPSK modulator.

14.5 RECOMMENDED READING AND WEB SITES
[OHAR99] is an excellent technical treatment of IEEE 802.11. [GEIE99] also provides
detailed coverage of the IEEE 802.11 standards, and numerous case studies. [CROW97] is a
good survey article on the 802.11 standards. Neither of the last two references covers IEEE
802.11a and IEEE 802.11b. [GEIE01] has a good discussion of IEEE 802.11a.
