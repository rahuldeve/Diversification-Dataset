Transmission Media

• Transmission medium
– Physical path between transmitter and receiver
– May be guided (wired) or unguided (wireless)
– Communication achieved by using em waves
• Characteristics and quality of data transmission
– Dependent on characteristics of medium and signal
– Guided medium
∗ Medium is more important in setting transmission parameters
– Unguided medium
∗ Bandwidth of the signal produced by transmitting antenna is important in setting transmission parameters
∗ Signal directionality
· Lower frequency signals are omnidirectional
· Higher frequency signals can be focused in a directional beam
• Design of data transmission system
– Concerned with data rate and distance
– Bandwidth
∗ Higher bandwidth implies higher data rate
– Transmission impairments
∗ Attenuation
∗ Twisted pair has more attenuation than coaxial cable which in turn is not as good as optical fiber
– Interference
∗ Can be minimized by proper shielding in guided media
– Number of receivers
∗ In a shared link, each attachment introduces attenuation and distortion on the line

Guided transmission media
• Transmission capacity (bandwidth and data rate) depends on distance and type of network (point-to-point or
multipoint)
• Twisted pair
– Least expensive and most widely used
– Physical description
∗ Two insulated copper wires arranged in regular spiral pattern
∗ Number of pairs are bundled together in a cable
∗ Twisting decreases the crosstalk interference between adjacent pairs in the cable, by using different
twist length for neighboring pairs

– Transmission characteristics
∗ Single-encoded beam of light transmitted by total internal reflection
∗ Transparent medium should have higher refractive index compared to surrounding medium
Refractive Index – The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a medium
under consideration
∗ Optical fiber acts as a waveguide for frequencies in the range of about 1014 to 1015 Hz (IR and visible
regions of spectrum)
∗ Step-index multimode
· Rays at shallow angles are reflected and propagated along the fiber
· Other rays are absorbed by the surrounding material
∗ Multimode transmission
· Allows for multiple propagation paths, with different path lengths and time to traverse the fiber
· Signal elements can be spread over time
· Limits the rate at which data can be accurately received
· Best suited for transmission over very short distances
∗ Single-mode transmission
· Reduced fiber core will allow fewer angles to be reflected
· Single transmission path reduces distortion
· Typically used for long-distance applications
∗ Graded-index multimode
· Lies in between single-mode and multimode

Transmission Media

28

· Higher refractive index at the center implies that the rays close to axis advance slowly compared
to rays close to the cladding
· Light in the core curves helically reducing its traveling distance (does not zig zag off the cladding)
· Shorter path and higher speed makes light at periphery as well as at the axis travel at the same
speed
∗ Light sources
1. Light-emitting diode (led)
· Cheaper and works over a greater temperature range
· Longer operational life
2. Injection laser diode (ild)
· More efficient and can sustain greater data rates
– Wavelength-division multiplexing
∗ Multiple beams of light at different frequencies can be transmitted simultaneously
∗ Form of frequency-division multiplexing (fdm) commonly known as wavelength-division multiplexing
(wdm)

∗ Fixed rigidly with a focused beam along line of sight to receiving antenna
∗ With no obstacles, maximum distance (d, in km) between antennae can be
√
d = 7.14 Kh
where h is antenna height and K is an adjustment factor to account for the bend in microwave due
to earth’s curvature, enabling it to travel further than the line of sight; typically K = 43

∗ Fewer repeaters than coaxial cable but needs line of sight
– Transmission characteristics
∗ Frequencies in the range of 2 – 40 ghz
∗ Higher frequency implies higher bandwidth leading to higher data rates
∗ Loss L due to attenuation over distance d at wavelength λ is expressed as

2
4πd
L = 10 log
dB
λ
· Loss varies as the square of distance
· For twisted pair and coaxial cable, loss varies logarithmically with distance
∗ Repeaters may be placed further apart compared to coaxial cable
∗ Attenuation may increase with rainfall, especially above 10 ghz
∗ Interference is a problem, leading to regulated assignment of frequencies
• Satellite microwave
– Physical description
∗ Communication satellite is a microwave relay station between two or more ground stations (also called
earth stations)

∗ A single satellite can operate on a number of frequency bands, known as transponder channels or
transponders
∗ Geosynchronous orbit (35,784 km)
∗ Satellites cannot be too close to each other to avoid interference
· Current standard requires a 4◦ displacement in the 4/6 ghz band and 3◦ displacement at 12/14
ghz
