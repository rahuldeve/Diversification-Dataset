The More Global Warming Emissions are Reduced, the Less Severe the Consequences Will Be

California has a choice: 

continue emitting large quantities 
of global warming pollutants from 
its cars, power plants, and factories, or be 
a climate leader by making significant cuts 
in emissions and slowing global warming. 
  heat-trapping emissions have to be 
greatly reduced in order to avoid the most 
severe consequences of global warming.  
if the industrialized world were to follow 
californias lead of reducing emissions  
80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, 

and industrializing nations followed there-
after, global emissions would remain in or 
below the lower emissions scenario (see 
table above), thus increasing the likelihood 
that california and the world would be on 
track to avoid the more severe effects of 
climate change. emission reduction targets 
such as those set by the state of california 
could create the incentives and spur in-
novation necessary to lead a global tran-
sition to cleaner and more resource-
efficient technologies. n
