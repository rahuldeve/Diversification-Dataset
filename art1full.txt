O

n August 29, 2005, Hurricane
Katrina made landfall on the gulf
coast of the United States, east of
New Orleans,1 with the storm’s eye passing
within 10 to 15 miles of the city. The effect
on New Orleans, as well as on the entire
coastal region, was devastating.
In the aftermath of the storm, about 80
percent of the city (much of which is below sea level) was flooded. A recent article
estimated damages in excess of $200 billion, making Katrina one of the most economically costly hurricanes ever to strike the
United States.2 Reacting to the widespread
destruction, the 109th Congress enacted
two supplementary appropriation bills totaling $62.3 billion for emergency response
and recovery needs.3 The death toll has been
estimated at more than 1,200.4 In addition,
tens of thousands of citizens were evacuated
to other parts of the Nation.
Besides taking its toll on the human,
social, and psychological fabric of the city,
the storm had a notable effect on the city’s
economy, its labor market dynamics, and its
individual businesses. Just what these effects
were has been the subject of some discussion. This article joins the discussion in its
analysis of employment and wage data.
In what follows, trends in employment and
wage patterns based on data provided by the

Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
(QCEW) program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, the Bureau) are compared before
and after the storm to measure the extent of the
losses during the first 10 months (September
2005 to June 2006) following Katrina.
The findings indicate the extensive effect of
Katrina on the New Orleans labor market. The
over-the-year loss to the city economy averaged
95,000 jobs during the first 10 months after the
hurricane. The job-loss trough occurred in November 2005, when the employment total was
105,300 below what it had been a year earlier.
Ten months after the hurricane, in June 2006,
the over-the-year job loss had diminished
to 92,900. The loss in wages during the 10
months following Katrina was approximately
$2.9 billion, with 76 percent of it, or $2.2 billion, associated with the private sector.5

The New Orleans economy
In order to understand fully the economic
impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans, it is important to assess the impact
of the economic forces driving the city. In
making this assessment, two approaches offer insights.
The first approach, which occupies the
next section and to which the analysis returns
at the end of the article, evaluates the diverMonthly Labor Review  •  June 2007  

Effects of Katrina on New Orleans

sity within the New Orleans economy compared with that
of the Nation. This comparative and static approach uses
location quotients based on employment concentration by
industry sector; it points out which industrial sectors of
the New Orleans economy have a higher concentration
of jobs compared with those same industrial sectors of the
national economy. (If a New Orleans industry has a greater
share than expected, compared with the U.S. share of that
industry, then the industry, with its “extra” employment, is
assumed to be “basic,” or an export industry, because those
additional jobs are above what a local economy needs to
serve local needs. Basic New Orleans industries become
particularly relevant in assessing New Orleans opportunities for recovery, because it is those industries which connect New Orleans to the rest of the Nation.)
Generalizing the analysis from industry concentration
to include the total New Orleans economy, the second
analytic approach is a time-focused comparison of changes in the total number of jobs, total wages, and average
weekly wages, which together define the New Orleans’
labor market. Assessing these changes affords additional
insights, because they represent New Orleans at two different points in time and underscore temporary population displacement and its effect on the local economy.
This approach, which provides a basis for assessing the
effects of Katrina, will be utilized throughout the rest of
the article.

Export industries of New Orleans
As can be seen in table 1, the New Orleans economy can
be compared to a three-legged stool, with tourism, port
operations, and education serving as the legs of the stool
and thereby providing its foundation.
Tourism (arts, entertainment, and recreation; accommodation
and food service).  As is widely recognized, New Orleans
is, or at least has been, among the most visited cities in the
United States. Besides the attraction of its French Quarter, its internationally renowned restaurants, and its firstclass accommodations, a series of celebrations, including
Mardi Gras, the New Orleans Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, and
the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, has drawn
thousands of tourists to the city.
Port operations (mining; transportation and warehousing).
Less recognized than tourism is the importance of the
Port of New Orleans. In combination with the Port of
South Louisiana located in nearby LaPlace, the Port of
New Orleans handles the most bulk tonnage in the world.
  Monthly Labor Review  •  June 2007

About 5,000 ships from nearly 60 countries dock at the
Port of New Orleans each year. Chief exports—to other
countries and different regions of the Nation—include
grain and foodstuffs produced by Midwestern farmers and
petroleum products mined in the Gulf of Mexico. Among
the port’s leading imports are chemicals, petroleum, coffee, and cocoa beans. The port handles more trade with
Latin America than any other U.S. gateway.6
Educational services.  Also less recognized than tourism is
the role of New Orleans as a center of higher education.
Located within the city are Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, Loyola University New Orleans,
Xavier University of New Orleans, Southern University of
New Orleans, Dillard University, and the Louisiana State
University Medical School. In addition, a number of community colleges and technical schools lie within the city’s
boundaries. Of special note is the fact that Dillard, Xavier,
and Southern University—all serving predominantly African-American students—have educated significant numbers of professionals who have resided in the city.

Pre-Katrina
From 1990 to 2000, the U.S. economy, as measured by
total employment, grew by 19.5 percent, or 21.4 million
jobs. During the same period, the country’s population increased by 13.1 percent, or 32.7 million people.7 In New
Orleans, however, the results were different: during the
decade, the city lost both jobs and population (as regards
the latter, more than 12,000 residents, or 2.5 percent of
the city’s population base).
In 1990, almost half of employment in New Orleans
(48.5 percent) was associated with four sectors: accommodation and food services (10.9 percent), retail trade
(9.3 percent), health care and social assistance (9.2 percent), and government (19.1 percent). In the aggregate,
these four sectors provided 39.8 percent of the total wages
generated in the city.
Accommodation and food services, a significant part of
the “three-legged stool,” is also an export New Orleans industry. By contrast, in local industries, such as retail trade
and health care and social assistance, job levels are related
to the local population size and reflect the needs of that
population.
The 1990 New Orleans average weekly wage in private
industry, $424, was 2.1 percent below the national average of $433, due to fact that a high percentage of New
Orleans jobs were in the lowest paying sectors, namely, accommodation and food services, and retail trade.8 Despite

this relatively low average wage, a defining strength of
the city’s economy was its wide distribution of industries
providing employment opportunities. Other than tourism, which represented 12.2 percent of employment, and
government, which, as mentioned earlier, accounted for
19.1 percent of jobs, no individual sector dominated the
economic landscape.
By 2000, a shift had taken place in the New Orleans
employment base: the city lost 2.3 percent of its 1990 private-sector job base. (See table 2.) But this loss was only
part of the story. During the decade, the tourism industry increased in importance until, by 2000, it represented
16.0 percent of employment and 8.0 percent of the total
wages generated in the city. Government also increased in
significance and represented 20.8 percent of all jobs and
24.7 percent of total wages. In 2000, 1 out of 5 people
working in New Orleans was employed by Federal, State
or local government, 1 out of 6 in tourism, and 1 out of
10 in health care.
In 10 years, the national average weekly wage in private
industry had increased to $648, 13.1 percent higher than
in New Orleans.9 Thus, in terms of average wages, the
gap between New Orleans and the Nation had widened.
Both the level and the change in average wage underscore
the importance of the “three-legged stool” to the New
Orleans economy. Although the average New Orleans

2004

wage was below that of the United States, the city did
have an array of high-paying industries. Table 3 shows
the 10 highest average weekly wages among New Orleans
subsectors in 1990 and 2004. Oil and gas extraction, water
transportation, and warehousing and storage—all important elements of the “three-legged stool”—were among
the highest ranked industries in the city.
Similarly, despite job losses and relatively low average
wages in the city, a number of subsectors experienced notable increases in wages between 1990 and 2004. Five of the
10 industries with the largest increases during this period
were from the “three-legged stool” sectors, as indicated in
table 4. In all of these subsectors, wages grew at a rate that
was almost 2 times the all-industry average for the city.
Job and population losses in New Orleans, identified during the 1990s, continued into the 21st century.
By 2004, the New Orleans economy had lost more than
16,000 jobs (6.2 percent) since 2000. (See table 5.) The
city’s population declined by an additional 23,000 residents, or 4.7 percent, during the same period.
By comparison, during this same timeframe U.S. population increased by 4.1 percent, or 11.5 million. Employment in the country, however, remained relatively fixed,
declining by about 860,000 jobs, or less than 1 percent.10
The average weekly wage in New Orleans private industry
increased to $643, while in the Nation the average weekly

wage rose to $712, about 11.0 percent higher than the
New Orleans figure. Tourism maintained its importance
in the city’s economy, representing 16.0 percent of jobs
and 10.0 percent of total wages.
Despite the overall decrease in the city’s employment
base compared with 2000, jobs in professional and technical services increased by 3.3 percent from 2000 to 2004.
With average weekly wages of $964, this was one of the
highest paying sectors among the city’s private establishments and represented 7.9 percent of total wages, second
only to health care and social assistance.
By the end of June 2005, private-sector employment in
New Orleans continued its decline. The second-quarter
average figure of 191,701 jobs represented a further decrease of about 3,500 jobs, or 1.8 percent, compared with
the figure for the same quarter the previous year.

Post-Katrina
To gain a clear picture of the effect of Katrina, this section
presents a series of charts that display various monthly
time series of over-the-year employment changes from
2004 to 2006. Monthly data from January 2004 to June
2006 summarize employment and total pay (exclusive of
benefits) of workers covered by State and Federal unemployment insurance. Coverage is broad and is estimated at
97.0 percent of all wage and salary employees working in
New Orleans during the 2004–06 period.
The methodology presented compares employment
levels in the current month with those of the same
month in the previous year. (The 42 data points are thus
reduced to 30 in each chart.) This approach overcomes
problems associated with seasonal patterns in employ-

ing and others were contracting. To evaluate the impact of
Katrina on rates of growth (or decline), as well as to assess the magnitude of the loss, a trend line was inferred
from January 2003 to August 2005. The deviation from
this trend line during the subsequent months indicates the
impact of Katrina, not only in terms of job loss, but also on
the rate of sector growth, and both of these were considered
in evaluating the economic effects of the hurricane.

ment data that are not seasonally adjusted.
Not all industries were affected to the same extent by
the hurricane, because the economic circumstance of each
sector varied. Before Katrina, some industries were grow-

Chart 1 presents a picture of job losses in the New Orleans economy from January 2004 to June 2006. Both
the gradual, but steady, loss of jobs—from January 2004
to August 2005—and the dynamic and catastrophic loss
of jobs—from September 2005 to June 2006—are represented. The trend line extrapolates what the New Orleans economy would likely have looked like had Katrina
not occurred.11 As stated previously, the findings indicate
Katrina’s devastating effect on New Orleans’ labor market.
During the first 10 months after the hurricane, the city
suffered an over-the-year average loss of 95,000 jobs. At
the trough of the job loss, in November 2005, employment was 105,300 below the previous year’s November
figure. By June 2006, the over-the-year job loss, though
smaller, was still substantial (92,900). Lost wages over
the 10-month period from September 2005 to June 2006
were about $2.9 billion, with 76 percent of the loss attributable to the private sector.

Job losses by sector: a visualization
To provide additional information about the effects of
Katrina, this section examines separate sectors of the New
Orleans economy to see how they responded to the storm
and its aftermath.
Tourism.  As noted earlier, tourism had been one of the
bright spots in the New Orleans economy in terms of
employment. Between 1990 and 2004, jobs grew by 33.0
percent (10,715) in the sector, and they continued to grow
in the months preceding the hurricane. As chart 2 shows,
the industry was particularly hard hit by Katrina. First,
tourism experienced the largest job loss among all sectors; second, tourism would have shown further gains in
employment had the hurricane not struck the city.
During the 10-month period studied, the tourism
industry lost approximately 22,900 jobs. Over the 10
months following the hurricane, the loss in wages in the
sector was about $382.7 million.

Port operations.  Chart 3 points up the effects of Katrina
on port operations. As the chart shows, employment was
severely affected by Katrina, the sector having added
jobs prior to the hurricane. After a precipitous decline
commencing in August 2005, the sector started to rebound. However, the rebound was short lived, and due to
the higher wages paid in the sector, the overall financial
impact of the jobs that were lost was disproportionately
higher than the impact in the tourism sector. During the
10-month period, port operations saw about 3,500 jobs
disappear and lost wages amounted to approximately
$136.1 million.
Professional, scientific, and technical services.  In 2005,
prior to the hurricane, the professional, scientific, and
technical services sector recorded a loss of jobs during
most of the year. Like the entire New Orleans economy,
the sector experienced a precipitous decline after August
2005, but demonstrated a marked improvement begin  Monthly Labor Review  •  June 2007

ning in September. As chart 4 shows, the professional
and technical services sector was one of the bright spots
in the New Orleans economy, returning to its pre-Katrina employment trend line by mid-2006. During the
10-month period, the sector lost approximately 1,680
jobs overall. The loss of wages was about $84.6 million.
Construction.  The construction sector has been the one
industry registering job gains in the New Orleans economy. Immediately following the hurricane, job losses
were registered, but as recovery efforts began and then
took hold, there was an overall increase in employment
during the 10-month period examined. (See chart 5.)
The sector posted a net gain of 4,927 construction jobs,
adding $1.8 million to the city’s economy.
Educational services.  The educational services sector
had experienced volatility in employment even before
Katrina devastated the city. In the aftermath of the

hurricane, the sector reached its nadir in job losses in
November 2005, after which it began a steady recovery.
By May 2006, educational services had almost reached
pre-Katrina employment levels; however, employment
losses began again soon after. (See chart 6.) During the
10-month period, educational services lost approximately 1,910 jobs, amounting to $66.4 million in lost
wages.
Health care and social services.  Job losses in the health
care and social services sector mirrored those of the New
Orleans economy as a whole. That is, precipitous losses
occurred immediately following Katrina, and significant
losses continued throughout the 10-month period studied. (See chart 7.) During that period, health care and
social services posted a loss of 13,418 jobs, with $377.8
million in lost wages.

Employment and wages
As shown in charts 2–7, Katrina’s devastating effect on
the New Orleans economy was not shared equally by

all sectors. In assessing the 10-month aftermath of the
hurricane, it becomes apparent that sectors having the
lowest average weekly wage were hardest hit. Besides
eliminating jobs from the New Orleans economy, the
loss of these lower paying jobs had an effect on the entire
economic structure by raising the average weekly wage
for the city. In order to further a more complete understanding of that effect, this section divides the post-Katrina period into three specific quarters and analyzes the
economic impact of the storm during each quarter.
Fourth quarter, 2005.  For the months of October,
November, and December 2005—the timeframe that
immediately followed the hurricane—average overthe-year job losses were 103,316, or 41.7 percent of the
city’s fourth-quarter, 2004, job base. (See table 6.) An
examination of these job losses reveals that 46.1 percent
were centered in just three sectors: retail trade, which lost
12,140 jobs, or 62.8 percent of its job base; accommodation and food services, in which 21,133 jobs, or 59.3 percent of its job base, were eliminated; and health care and
social assistance, which lost 14,330 jobs, or 56.4 percent

of its job base. As data from table 5 indicate, these sectors
were among the lowest paid in the entire New Orleans
economy. Because of the disproportionate loss of jobs in
all three sectors, the average weekly wage for those jobs
remaining in the city rose 29.4 percent.
Although retail trade, accommodation and food services, and health care and social assistance bore the brunt
of the job losses due to Katrina, practically all sectors of
the New Orleans economy suffered notable job losses
that, in effect, paralyzed most of the city. (In the utilities
and mining sectors, in which the number of jobs was
relatively small, employment was static on an over-theyear basis).
Job losses during the fourth quarter were due to two

	NOTE:  Percentage bases include the approximately 0.3 percent
of private employment with nonclassifiable industries.

factors: the destruction of the city’s infrastructure, thereby eliminating places of employment; and the destruction of homes and the subsequent public-health crisis,
which together forced large segments of the employed
population to leave the city.
First quarter, 2006.  For the months of January, February, and March 2006, a slight improvement in New Orleans’ economic structure began to emerge. The average
over-the-year loss of jobs during the quarter was 99,114,
or 41.0 percent of the city’s first-quarter, 2005, base.
(See table 7.) Over the quarter, 44.1 percent of all job
losses were associated with retail trade (10,955 jobs, or
58.0 percent of the industry’s job base), accommodation

As a result of this continued disproportionate number of
job losses at the lower end of the wage scale, the average
weekly wage for those jobs which remained in the city
increased by 33.7 percent.
Significant job losses continued throughout many
of the sectors making up the New Orleans economy.
However, some rays of light had begun to emerge. On
an over-the-year basis, employment in the construction
sector increased by 31.2 percent (about 1,700 jobs) as the
city began the initial steps to rebuild. A revival in business
activity also was indicated by a slowing of job losses in the

professional, scientific, and technical sector (the sector lost
just 8.8 percent of its job base on an over-the-year basis), with average monthly employment increasing from
the previous quarter. Clearly, the city’s economy was still
desperate, but some signs of slight improvement were
visible.
Second quarter, 2006. During April, May, and June 2006,
the intensity of job loss continued to abate. By the end of
the quarter, losses stood at 93,594 jobs, or 38.3 percent
of the city’s second-quarter, 2005, job base. (See table
8.) Of all the job losses in the New Orleans economy
over the quarter, 44.4 percent were associated with retail
trade (about 9,770 jobs, or 51.4 percent of the industry’s

job base), accommodation and food services (18,070
jobs, or 49.1 percent of the industry’s job base), and
health care and social assistance (13,718 jobs, or 57.9
percent of the industry’s job base). As a result of these
job losses, the average weekly wage for all jobs rose
28.2 percent.
Although grim, the economic climate in the city
was improving. Employment in the construction sector continued to grow, increasing, on average, by an
additional 2,000 jobs compared with the previous
quarter’s figure. On an over-the-year basis, employment in the sector increased by 27.0 percent, or 1,580
jobs. Employment in the professional, scientific, and
technical sector held steady at 12,500 jobs, but, on an

over-the-year basis, registered a 7.3-percent decline
of 988 jobs.

Over-the-year comparison
As noted, the two most significant effects of Katrina were
a massive loss of jobs and a significant rise in the city’s
average weekly wage. On an over-the-year basis, average
weekly wages increased 28.2 percent, to $887. The loss
of jobs changed the city’s employment patterns, but did
not alter the relation of the local to the base (export)
economy. By the second quarter of 2006, 81.4 percent
of those jobs which remained in the city were associated with the private sector; previously, private-sector

employment had accounted for 78.4 percent of all jobs.
Within the private sector itself, however, a redistribution
in employment had taken place. Whereas in the second
quarter of 2005 accommodation and food services, the largest employer in New Orleans, accounted for 15.0 percent
of all jobs, a year later the sector represented 12.4 percent
of employment (still the largest in the economy, though).
Employment shares for health care and social assistance had
decreased from 9.7 percent to 6.6 percent, while those for
retail trade had decreased from 7.8 percent to 6.1 percent.
By contrast, the following sectors increased their employment shares: professional, scientific, and technical, from 5.5
percent to 8.3 percent; and educational services, from 3.5
percent to 5.3 percent.
The rise in the proportion of private-sector jobs was
the result of a notable loss of government jobs: 46.7
percent, or 24,584 jobs, from the second quarter of
2005 to the same quarter of 2006. All segments of government experienced significant reductions in employment. Federal employment was reduced by 22.8 percent (2,838 jobs), and State employment decreased by
36.6 percent (6,944 jobs). However, it was in the local
governmental sector that massive job losses occurred:
on an over-the-year basis, the city reduced its governmental workforce by 69.6 percent, or 14,802 jobs.

Ten-month assessment
Over the 10-month period studied, 1 out of every 4
private-sector jobs lost (25.4 percent) was in the accommodation and food services sector. (See table 9.)
Due to lower-than-average wages associated with the
sector, those lost jobs accounted for just 1 out of every
7 dollars (14.5 percent) lost in total wages in the New
Orleans economy. About 1 out of every 6 jobs lost (17.9
percent), amounting to 1 out of every 5 dollars in lost
wages (19.6 percent), was associated with the health
care and social services sector, while 1 out of every 7
jobs lost (14.3 percent) and 1 out of every 10 dollars in
lost wages (10.5 percent) were associated with the retail
trade sector.
Thus, in terms of its effect on the private sector,
about 6 out of every 10 jobs lost (57.6 percent) and
nearly half of all dollars in lost wages (44.6 percent)
were associated with just three sectors: accommodation
and food services, health care and social assistance, and
retail trade.

and education serving as the legs of the stool and
thereby providing its foundation. Of interest is how
Katrina, with its effect on the employment and wage
dynamics of the city, may have altered that foundation.
In particular, what influence has the loss of so many
jobs, concentrated in a few specific industry sectors, exerted on New Orleans’s overall economic picture?
Examining the 2-year change in location quotients
(from the second quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of
2006) affords a number of insights into this issue. Despite
the extensive loss of jobs in the accommodation and food
services sector, tourism, with a 2006 location quotient of
1.60 (down from 1.90 in 2004) remains a basic (that is,
export) component of the New Orleans economy. (See
table 10.) Port operations, with a location quotient of
2.22 (compared with 1.80 in 2004), has increased in importance, as has educational services, with a 2006 location
quotient of 3.30, compared with 2.52 in 2004.
Of special note is the increase in strength recorded in
the professional, scientific, and technical sector (which

moved from a location quotient of 1.15 in 2004 to
1.57 in 2006), along with the weakening registered in
health care and social assistance (which dropped from
a location quotient of 1.04 in 2004 to 0.63 in 2006).
Significant job losses in this sector clearly weakened
its influence in the city’s economy and may indicate a
real deterioration in the availability of social services,
which are, of course, critical during a time of recovery
from a disaster.
Within the New Orleans economy, the location quotient for oil and gas extraction increased from 13.7 in
2001 to 14.0 in the second quarter of 2006, and that for
the related industry of marine cargo handling rose from
18.5 to 20.6 over the same period. Advances in technology have increased the proportion of exploratory wells,

enhanced offshore drilling capacities, and extended the
productive, useful life of existing wells. The supplies of oil
and gas, nonrenewable resources, depend heavily on their
price, which has fluctuated.
In addition, the overall New Orleans tourist industry has been based not only on the presence of physical structures, but also on the manifestation of the city’s
history in the lives of its people. Prior to the hurricanes,
the unique heritage of New Orleans as a former French
colony had lived on in its museums (with a location quotient of 2.32) and in the French tradition of converting
the experiences of daily life into song and music (musical groups and artists had a location quotient of 3.91).12
These location quotients show that, despite the shock to
the New Orleans economy as a result of Hurricane Katrina, industries associated with the “three-legged stool”
(that is, tourism, port operations, and educational services) have maintained their relative strength. 
Moreover,
the employment outlook overall for these sectors is
favorable.13
National numbers project that, over the next decade, overall employment in colleges and universities
is expected to rise by 34.3 percent, with increases of
25.1 percent in arts, entertainment, and recreation and
16.6 percent in accommodation and food services.14
Thus, despite a lackluster economy prior to Katrina,
the structure of the New Orleans economy has a triumvirate source of economic strength—tourism, port
operations, and education—that bodes well for the future. Current data indicate that the rebuilding of New
Orleans has resulted in steady, continuing employment
growth.
Chart 8 presents two trend lines.15 The top line, commencing in January 2004, projects the long-term employment level in New Orleans had Katrina not devastated the city. The bottom line, starting in October
2006, after the initial destruction and amidst job losses,
is projected forward. After having hit its low point of
137,785 jobs in January 2006, the New Orleans employment level continues to increase, suggesting that there
is a base for recovery. in the post-Katrina New Orleans
labor economy.

For the purposes of this article, “New Orleans” refers to the city
of New Orleans (Orleans Parish), as opposed to the larger metropolitan area composed of 12 parishes. The city’s employment and wage
losses were just part of the total economic damage caused by Katrina.
The analytic framework presented herein will focus on second-quarter data to maintain consistency with the latest quarter (the second
quarter of 2006) for which data are available for New Orleans.

To avoid the effects of seasonal fluctuation, estimates of employment and wage loss were based on year-to-year differences in monthly
employment before and after Hurricane Katrina. Within a given quarter,
monthly employment differences were multiplied by the base quarter’s
average weekly wage. In evaluating the relative shares of the private-sector loss among industry sectors, this analysis was performed at the North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) sector level. Because
the over-the-year loss spanned into higher employment in previous years
(annual levels of employment had been declining in New Orleans every
year since 2001), this method may have slightly overstated the overall
employment loss. The wage loss, however, may have been understated,
because it was based on year-old average wage levels. The base-quarter
average wage, as opposed to the more recent wage, more accurately re18  Monthly Labor Review  •  June 2007

Therefore, estimates of employment and wages lost to the hurricane
are likely conservative.
