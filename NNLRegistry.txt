NATIONAL REGISTRY OF NATURAL LANDMARKS 
 
Summary: This publication lists all National Natural Landmarks (NNL) currently included on the 
National Registry of Natural Landmarks.  This listing provides information on each landmarks 
natural values, designation date, and ownership type. 
 
For Further Information Contact: Natural Resources Stewardship and Science, National Park 
Service, 1201 I Street N.W., Washington, D.C., 20005. 
 
Supplemental Information: The National Natural Landmarks Program was established by the 
Secretary of the Interior in 1962, under authority of the Historic Sites Act of 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 
et seq.) to identify and encourage the preservation of the full range of geological and biological 
features that are determined to represent nationally significant examples of the Nations natural 
heritage.  Potential sites are evaluated by qualified scientists and, if determined nationally 
significant, recommended to the Secretary of the Interior for designation.  Once a landmark is 
designated it is included on the National Registry of Natural Landmarks, which currently lists 
586 NNLs nationwide. 
 
The National Registry of Natural Landmarks includes nationally significant geological and 
biological features in 48 states, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  
Of the 586 landmarks currently listed on the Registry approximately one-half are administered 
solely by public agencies (e.g., Federal, State, county, or municipal governments), nearly one-
third are owned entirely by private parties and the remaining are owned or administered by a 
mixture of public and private owners.  Because many natural landmarks are privately owned 
and/or not managed for public access, owner permission must be obtained prior to visitation.  
Designation in no way infers any right of public access. 
 
National Natural Landmark designation is not a land withdrawal, does not change the ownership 
of a site, and does not dictate use or activity.  However, Federal agencies should consider the 
unique properties of these nationally significant areas in completing compliance under the 
National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and there may be State or local 
planning or land use implications. 
 
National Registry of Natural Landmarks 
 
The following list contains all NNLs included on the National Registry of Natural Landmarks as 
of June 2009.  The landmarks are arranged alphabetically by state and county.  The number of 
landmarks in each state is enclosed in parentheses following each states name.  A description 
of each landmarks natural values, designation date, and ownership type is provided.  
Ownership categories include Federal, State, county, municipal, Indian Trust, and private.  The 
order does not reflect the relative amount of land owned by any party.  The information 
contained herein can also be found on the NNL website at http://www.nature.nps.gov/nnl/.

(extends into Mobile and Washington Counties)  Mobile-Tensaw 
River Bottomlands is one of the most important wetlands in the 
nation.  The site contains a variety of habitats, including mesic 
floodplains, freshwater swamps and brackish water marshes, and 
supports several rare and endangered species.  Designation: 1974.  
Ownership: State, private. 
 
 
 
The Dismals is a moist sandstone gorge cut by Dismals Branch.  
The site contains a rich diversity of native plant life, including a 
stand of virgin timber composed chiefly of hemlock, tulip poplar, 
sweetgum, and beech.  Huge blocks of sandstone have broken 
away from the gorge walls and lie in haphazard fashion on the floor, 
producing many natural bridges and damp rockface microhabitats.  
Designation: 1974.  Ownership: Private. 

 
 
The Red Mountain Expressway Cut exhibits an unusual 
combination of stratigraphic and structural features that record the 
geological development of this part of the Southern Appalachian 
fold belt during Paleozoic time.  In one location, because the strata 
are tilted, exposed rocks represent a 150 million-year geological 
record along a distance of only 650 feet.  Additionally, the exposed 
rocks contain a rare Silurian trilobite species.   Designation: 1987.  
Ownership: Municipal. 
 
 
 
Beaverdam Creek Swamp, located within Wheeler National Wildlife 
Refuge, is a prime tupelo gum swamp.  Occurring within the Interior 
Low Plateaus biophysiographic province, this habitat type is an 
unusual occurrence, as it is typically found farther south in the Gulf 
Coastal Plain biophysiographic province.  Designation: 1974.  
Ownership: Federal.

Developed in fossiliferous Warsaw Limestone of Mississippian Age, 
Shelta Cave contains a large underground lake deep within.  The 
cave is noted for its diverse and complex aquatic fauna, including 
some species that are known to exist only in this cave.  Designated: 
1971.  Ownership: Private. 
 
 
 
Located within Cathedral Caverns State Park, Cathedral Caverns 
consists of a series of large chambers containing flowing 
underground streams and a variety of decorative speleothems, 
such as stalagmites, totem poles, dripstone slopes and walls.  The 
huge entrance to the cave is 125 feet wide by 50 feet high and is 
spanned by a thin, almost flat arch.  Designated: 1972.  Ownership: 
State. 
 
 
 
(see Baldwin County) 

 
 
 
Newsome Sinks Karst Area occupies a north-south trending karst 
valley about 4 miles long, 3/4 mile wide and 400 feet deep.  Both 
ends of the drainage basin are higher in elevation than the valley 
floor, forcing water runoff to escape through subterranean 
passageways.  The Newsome Sinks area is hollowed out by more 
than 40 caves, with over 50,000 feet of known passages.  Most of 
the passages are dry, carrying water only during periods of heavy 
rainfall.   Designated: 1973.  Ownership: Private.

Aniakchak Crater, located within Aniakchak National Monument, is 
one of the largest explosive craters in the world, averaging 6 miles 
wide and 2000 feet deep.  The crater contains Surprise Lake, a 
warm springs fed lake that provides spawning grounds for a unique 
subspecies of salmon.  The lake is the source of the Aniakchak 
River, which flows through a breach in the crater rim to the Pacific 
Ocean.  The last eruption of this volcano was in 1931.  Designated: 
1967.  Ownership: Federal. 
 
Located within Gates of the Arctic National Park, the Arrigetch 
Peaks have long been a landmark to the Nunamiut Eskimo people 
of northwest Alaska.  Carved by glacial ice and running water, the 
conspicuous granite pinnacles rise thousands of feet above the 
surrounding glacial valleys of tundra and boreal forest.  The 
Arrigetch Peaks illustrate several phases of alpine glacier activities 
and reveal abrupt transitions from metamorphic to granitic rock.  
Designated: 1968.  Ownership: Federal. 

Located within Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, Bogoslof 
Island, a product of several volcanic eruptions, is recognized by 
geologists to be a prime example of volcanism at work.  The most 
recent eruption in 1992 added a new dome to the east end of the 
island.  The island supports an important rookery and haulout for 
endangered Steller sea lions, and nesting grounds for over 50,000 
murres, kittiwakes and other sea birds. Designated: 1967.  
Ownership: Federal. 
 
Located within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, the 
Clarence Rhode National Wildlife Range is an excellent example of 
coastal and upland tundra habitat; consisting of more than 50,000 
lakes and ponds, meandering streams, extensive tide flats and low 
shrub and sedge tundra.  The site provides nesting grounds for 
most of the world's black brant, cackling and emperor geese, and 
numerous other waterfowl, shorebirds, and sandhill cranes.  
Designated: 1968.  Ownership: Federal, State, private. 
 
Iliamna Volcano, located within Lake Clark National Park, is a 
broad, cone-shaped active stratovolcano that rises to a summit of 
10,016 feet.   Most of the volcano is covered by snow and ice and 
at least 10 glaciers radiate from its summit.  Its great height and 
proximity to Cook Inlet make it readily visible from the east side of 
the inlet and from Anchorage.  Designated: 1976.   Ownership: 
Federal.

At the time of its designation, Lake George was the largest glacier-
dammed lake and one of the most consistent self-dumping lakes in 
North America.  The lake emptied almost annually for 49 years 
before 1967.  When the lake outlet was blocked by the Knik Glacier, 
the lake swelled with water until summer when the dam broke and 
the water dumped in a spectacular torrent into the Knik River.  
Designated: 1967.  Ownership: Federal, State, private. 
 
Malaspina Glacier, located primarily within Wrangell-St. Elias 
National Park, is the largest piedmont glacier in North America and 
one of the largest outside the ice cap regions of the world.  It 
provides classic examples of glacial mechanisms and fluctuations.  
This large body of ice has been noted by explorers concerned with 
navigation of the western coast of North America for more than two 
centuries.  Designated: 1968.  Ownership: Federal, State, private. 
 
The McNeil River State Game Sanctuary contains a portion of the 
McNeil River with a series of low, shallow falls that afford easy 
wading and good visibility for brown bears fishing for salmon.  The 
concentration of bears fishing at the falls provides a world 
renowned bear viewing opportunity.  The site provides permanent 
protection for brown bear and other fish and wildlife populations and 
their habitats.  Designated: 1968.  Ownership: State. 
 
An active volcano of great mass, Mount Veniaminof contains a 
cupped ice field of 25 square miles, the most extensive crater-
glacier in the nation.  The caldera originated when the former 
summit collapsed.  It is the only known glacier on the continent with 
an active volcanic vent in its center.  Located within Alaska 
Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge, Veniaminof is usually shrouded 
in fog and clouds, and local residents indicate that the entire 
volcano is visible only one or two days a year.  Designated: 1967.  
Ownership: Federal. 
 
An active stratovolcano, Redoubt Volcano is the second highest of 
the 76 major volcanoes of the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian 
Islands.  Located within Lake Clark National Park, extensive 
glaciers and ice fields cover much of the volcano.  There was a 
major eruption of Redoubt in 1989, with ash deposition as far north 
as central Alaska.  Designated: 1976.  Ownership: Federal. 
 
Located within Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, Shishaldin 
Volcano is the highest volcano on Unimak Island.  Used for 
centuries as a landmark, this explosive stratovolcano is primarily 
known for its remarkable form, a near perfect cone, which it has 
retained despite violent eruptions.  Designated: 1967.  Ownership: 
Federal.

One of the islands in the Shumagin Island Group, Simeonof Island, 
within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, is an ancestral 
hauling ground for sea otters.  The rich kelp and eel grass beds in 
tideland waters surrounding the island are rich in marine life 
providing ideal habitat for sea otters.  Upland areas on the island 
support Arctic fox, ground squirrels, river otters, and various 
species of waterfowl, shorebirds and passerines.  Designated: 
1968.  Ownership: Federal. 
 
Exposures of petrified logs and stumps along the shores of Unga 
Island are remnants of a sequoia or metasequoia forest buried as a 
result of volcanic activity in the Tertiary Period.  The petrified forest 
remains hold scientific significance for the passage of species 
between Asia and America and help portray the climate and 
environment of the Aleutian Arc before humans inhabited Alaska.  
The site is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.  
Designated: 1968.  Ownership: State, private. 
 
Walker Lake, located within Gates of the Arctic National Park, is a 
striking and scenic example of the geological and biological 
relationships of a mountain lake at the northern limit of forest 
growth.  It is typical of the glacial lakes formed in rock basins or 
behind moraine dams along both flanks of the Brooks Range.  
There is representation of a full range of ecological communities 
from white spruce forest on the shores to the barren talus slopes 
2000 feet above the lake.  Designated: 1968.  Ownership: Federal, 
State, private. 
 
Walrus Islands are the southernmost primary haul-out area for bull 
walruses, and the only remaining area in the United States where 
they haul-out in appreciable numbers.  Over 4,000 have been 
counted here during the summer.  The landmark consists of seven 
islands that make up the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary.  
Designated: 1968.  Ownership: State. 

examples of most glacial features from accumulation areas to 
terminal moraines.  Partially located within Worthington Glacier 
State Recreation Site, it is one of the most road accessible glaciers 
in Alaska.  Visitors can park their vehicle nearby and then walk 
close to the face of the glacier.  Designated: 1968.  Ownership: 
State.

the last glaciation.  The ice stagnation features at the site, including 
eskers and kame deposits, are highly visible and well-preserved 
owing to the arid climate and lack of vegetation, and so are perhaps 
the most illustrative of such features in the United States.

The Great Gravel Bar of Moses Coulee contains the largest and 
best example of a pendent river bar formed by catastrophic glacial 
outburst floods that swept across the Columbia Plateau prior to the 
last Pleistocene glaciation.  The impressive scale of this feature, 
deposited in Moses Coulee, provides dramatic evidence for the 
violent flood waters that formed and once filled the coulee.  As a 
constructional landform, it thus serves as a complement to 
Drumheller Channels, which was eroded during the same flood 
events further downstream.  Designated: 1986.  Ownership: State, 
private. 
 
Withrow Moraine and Jameson Lake Drumlin Field contains the 
best examples of drumlins and the most illustrative segment of the 
only Pleistocene terminal moraine in the Columbia Plateau 
biophysiographic province.  Both features together provide readily 
observable evidence of the large-scale depositional and erosional 
processes that accompany continental glaciation.  They are also 
the only such glacial features in the world to show a clear 
geological relationship to catastrophic flooding, which occurred prior 
to the last advance of the ice sheet.  Designated: 1986.  Ownership: 
Private.
