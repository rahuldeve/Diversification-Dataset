The secure operation of the routing protocol is one of the major
challenges to be met for the  proliferation  of  the Mobile Ad hoc
Networking 
security
enhancements  have  been  proposed  mostly  for  reactive  MANET
protocols. The proposed here Secure Link State Routing Protocol
(SLSP) provides secure proactive topology discovery, which can
be  multiply  beneficial  to  the  network  operation.  SLSP  can  be
employed as a stand-alone protocol, or fit naturally into a hybrid
routing  framework,  when  combined  with  a  reactive  protocol.
SLSP  is  robust  against  individual  attackers,  it  is  capable  of
adjusting  its  scope  between  local  and  network-wide  topology
discovery,  and  it  is  capable  of  operating  in  networks  of
frequently changing topology and membership.

1. Introduction

The collaborative, self-organizing environment of the Mobile
Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) technology opens  the network  to
numerous  security  attacks  that  can  actively  disrupt  the  routing
protocol  and  disable  communication.  Recently,  a  number  of
protocols  have  been  proposed  to  secure  the  route  discovery
process  in  frequently  changing  MANET  topologies.  These
protocols  are  designed  to  perform  route  discovery  only  when  a
source node needs to route packets to a destination; that is, they
are reactive routing protocols [1-3]. Nevertheless, in many cases,
proactive  discovery  of  topology  can  be  more  efficient;  e.g.,  in
networks with low- to medium-mobility, or with high connection
rates  and  frequent  communication  with  a  large  portion  of  the
network nodes. Furthermore, hybrid routing protocols [4], which
are  the  middle  ground,  have  been  shown  to  be  capable  of
adapting  their  operation  to  achieve  the  best  performance  under
differing  operational  conditions  through  locally  proactive  and
globally reactive operation.

the  discovery  and 

In  this  paper,  we  study  how  to  provide  secure  proactive
routing  and  we  propose  a  proactive  MANET  protocol  that
secures 
link  state
information  across  mobile  ad  hoc  domains.  Our  goal  is  to
provide correct (i.e., factual), up-to-date, and authentic link state
information,  robust  against  Byzantine  behavior  and  failures  of
individual  nodes.  The  choice  of  a  link  state  protocol  provides
such robustness, unlike distance vector protocols [5], which can

be  significantly  more  affected  by  a  single  misbehaving  node.
Furthermore, the availability of explicit connectivity information,
present in link state protocols, has additional benefits: examples
include  the  ability  of  the  source  to  determine  and  route
simultaneously  across  multiple  routes  [6],  the  utilization  of  the
local topology for efficient dissemination of data [7] or efficient
propagation  of  control  traffic  [8].  Finally,  a  wide  range  of
MANET  instances  is  targeted  by  our  design,  which  avoids
restrictive  assumptions  on  the  underlying  network  trust  and
membership,  and  does  not  require  specialized  node  equipment
(e.g., GPS or synchronized clocks).

We  present  here  our  Secure  Link  State  Protocol  (SLSP)  for
mobile  ad  hoc  networks,  which  is  robust  against  individual
attackers.  SLSP  shares  security  goals  and  bears  some
resemblance  to  secure  link  state  routing  protocols  proposed  for
the  wired  Internet,  but,  at  the  same  time,  it  is  tailored  to  the
salient  features  of  the  MANET  paradigm.  More  specifically,
SLSP  does  rely  on  the  requirements  of  the  robust  flooding
protocol  [9],  that  is,  a  central  entity  to  distribute  all  keys
throughout  the  network  and  the  reliable  flooding  of  link  state
updates  throughout  the  entire  network.  SLSP  does  not  seek  to
synchronize the topology maps across all nodes or to support the
full exchange of link state databases [10]. Note that nodes cannot
be  provided  with  credentials  to  prove  their  authorization  to
advertise  specific 
the
continuously  changing  network  connectivity  and  membership.
Finally, the participation of nodes in routing does not stem from
their possession of credentials [12], since in MANET, all nodes
are expected to equally assist the network operation.

The  Secure  Link  State  Protocol  (SLSP)  for  mobile  ad  hoc
networks 
the  discovery  and
distribution  of  link  state  information.  The  scope  of  SLSP  may
range from a  secure neighborhood  discovery  to  a network-wide
secure  link  state  protocol.  SLSP  nodes  disseminate  their  link
state updates and maintain topological information for the subset
of  network nodes  within R hops,  which  is  termed  as  their  zone
[4].  Nevertheless,  SLSP  is  a  self-contained  link  state  discovery

protocol, even though it draws from, and naturally fits within, the
concept of hybrid routing.

2.1. Assumptions and network model

Each node is equipped with a public/private key pair, namely
EV and DV, and with a single network interface per node within a
MANET  domain.1  Key  certification  can  be  provided  by  a
coalition  of  K  nodes  and  the  use  of  threshold  cryptography
[15,13],  the use  of  local repositories  of  certificates  provided  by
the  network  nodes  [14],  or  a  distributed  instantiation  of  a  CA
[15].

Nodes  are  identified  by  their  IP  addresses,  which  may  be
assigned  by  a  variety  of  schemes,  e.g.,  dynamically  or  even
randomly  [16].  Although  EV  does  not  need  to  be  tied  to  the
nodes  IP  address,  it  could  be  beneficial  to  use  IP  addresses
derived  from  the  nodes  public  keys  [17].  Nodes  are  equipped
with  a  one-way  or  hash  function  H  [18,19]  and  a  public  key
cryptosystem.

Adversaries may disrupt the protocol operation by exhibiting
arbitrary malicious behavior: e.g., replay, forge, corrupt link state
updates, try  to  influence  the  topology  view  of  benign nodes,  or
exploit the protocol to mount Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

SLSP 

is  concerned  solely  with  securing 

topology
discovery; it does not guarantee that adversaries, which complied
with  its  operation  during route  discovery,  would  not  attempt  to
disrupt the actual data transmission at a later time. The protection
of the data transmission is a distinct problem, which we address
in a different publication [6].

the 

2.2. Overview

To counter adversaries, SLSP protects link state update (LSU)
packets  from  malicious  alteration,  as  they  propagate  across  the
network.  It  disallows  advertisements  of  non-existent,  fabricated
links, stops nodes from masquerading their peers, strengthens the
robustness  of  neighbor  discovery,  and  thwarts  deliberate  floods
of control traffic that exhausts network and node resources.

To  operate  efficiently  in  the  absence  of  a  central  key
management, SLSP provides for each node to distribute its public
key to nodes within its zone. Nodes periodically broadcast their
certified  key,  so 
their
subsequent link state updates. As the network topology changes,
nodes  learn  the  keys  of  nodes  that  move  into  their  zone,  thus
keeping  track  of  a  relatively  limited  number  of  keys  at  every
instance.

the  receiving  nodes  validate 

that 

SLSP  defines  a  secure  neighbor  discovery  that  binds  each
node V to its Medium Access Control (MAC) address and its IP
address, and allows all other nodes within transmission range to
identify V unambiguously, given that they already have EV.

their 

incident 

restricts  the propagation  of  the  LSU  packets  within  the  zone  of
their origin node. Receiving nodes validate the updates, suppress
duplicates,  and  relay  previously  unseen  updates  that  have  not
already propagated R hops. Link state information acquired from
validated LSU packets is accepted only if both nodes incident on
each link advertise the same state of the link.

2.3. Neighbor Discovery

Each  node  commits  its  Medium  Access  Control  (MAC)
address and its IP address, the (MACV, IPV) pair, to its neighbors
by broadcasting signed hello messages. Receiving nodes validate
the  signature  and  retain  the  information;  in  the  case  of  SUCV
addresses [17] the confirmation for the IP address can be done in
a memory-less manner.

The proposed binding of the MACV strengthens the robustness
of our scheme, by disallowing nodes from appearing as multiple
ones at the data link layer, and by assisting in protection against
flooding DoS attacks.

To achieve these goals, we propose that the Neighbor Lookup
Protocol (NLP) be an integral part of SLSP. NLP is responsible
for the  following tasks:  (i) maintaining  a mapping  of  MAC and
IP  layer  addresses  of  the  node's  neighbors,  (ii)  identifying
potential discrepancies, such as the use of multiple IP addresses
by  a  single  data-link  interface,  and  (iii)  measuring  the  rates  at
which  control  packets  are  received  from  each  neighbor,  by
differentiating the traffic primarily based on MAC addresses. The
measured rates  of  incoming  control  packets are  provided  to  the
routing protocol. This way, control traffic originating from nodes
that selfishly or maliciously attempt to overload the network can
be discarded.

Basically, NLP extracts and retains the 48-bit hardware source
address  for  each  received  (overheard)  frame,  along  with  the
encapsulated IP address. This requires  a  simple modification  of
the device driver [20], so that the data link address is passed up
to  the  routing  protocol  along  with  each  packet.  With  nodes
operating in promiscuous  mode,  the  extraction  of  such  pairs  of
addresses  from  all  overheard  packets  leads  to  a  significant
reduction  in  the  use  of  the  neighbor  discovery  and  query/reply
mechanisms for medium access control address resolution.

Each  node  updates  its  neighbor  table  by  retaining  both,  the
data-link  and  the  network  interface  addresses  addresses.  The
mappings between the two addresses are retained in the table as
long as transmissions from the corresponding neighboring nodes
are overheard; a lost neighbor timeout period2 is associated with
each table entry.

 NLP issues a notification to  SLSP,  according  to  the  content
of a received packet, in the event that: (i) a neighbor used an IP
address  different  from  the  address  currently  recorded  in  the
neighbor table, (ii) two neighbors used the same IP address (that
is,  a  packet  appears  to  originate  from  a  node  that  may  have
                                               
2  The  lost  neighbor  timeout  should  be  longer  than  the  timeout
periods associated with the flushing of routing information (link
state, routing table entries), related to the particular neighbor.

"spoofed"  an  IP  address),  (iii)  a  node  uses  the  same  medium
access control address as the detecting node (in that case, the data
link  address  may  be  spoofed).  Upon  reception  of 
the
notification, the routing protocol discards the packet bearing the
address that violated the aforementioned policies.

2.4. Link State Updates

Link  state  updates  are  identified  by  the  IP  address  of  their
originator  and  a  32-bit  sequence  number,  which  provides  an
ample  space  of  approximately  four  billion  updates.  To  ensure
that the LSUs propagate only within the zone of its origin, i.e., R
hops away, the node selects a random number X and calculates a
hash chain: Xi = Hi(X), i=1,...,R, H0(X)=X. It places XR and X1 in
the  zone_radius  and  the  hops_traversed  fields  of  the  LSU
header,3 respectively, and sets TTL equal to R-1, with R placed in
the RLSU field. Finally, a  signature  is appended,  with the header
format is shown in Figure 1.

Receiving  nodes  check  if  they  have  the  public  key  of  the
originating  node,  unless  the  key  is  attached  to  the  LSU  (see
section 2.5 below). For an  LSU  that has already  traveled  over  i
hops  (i=R-TTL),  if  i  is  less  than  the  radius  of  the  originating
node,  the  packet  is  not  relayed  unless  HR-i(hops_traversed)
equals  zone_radius.  Each  relaying  node  sets  hops_traversed
equal  to  H(hops_traversed),  decrements  TTL,  and  rebroadcasts
the LSU.

Figure 1: LSU Header

The  provided  information  is  discarded  after  a  confirmLS
timeout,  unless  both  nodes  incident  on  a  link  report  the  same
state.  Finally,  NLP  notifications  result  in  discarding  an  update
relayed by a misbehaved node. The flooding of the LSU packets
renders  the  protocol  resilient  against  malicious  failures  (e.g.,
packet  dropping,  alteration,  or  modification  of  the  packets
hops_traversed  field).  Meanwhile,  the  localized  flooding  keeps
the transmission and processing overhead low.

                                               
3 Hash chains have a wide range of applications; in the MANET
context, they have been used to assist in hop count authentication
[21].

2.5. Public Key Distribution

Nodes  use  Public  Key  Distribution  (PKD)  packets,  or  attach
their  certified  keys  to  LSU  packets.  PKD  packets,  shown  in
Figure  2,  are  flooded  throughout  the  zone,  or  they  may  be
distributed less frequently throughout an extended zone.

The LSU-based key broadcast provides for timely acquisition
of  the  key  and  thus  validation  of  routing  information  to  nodes
that move into a new zone. It also reduces to  a  great  extent the
transmission  of  PKD  packets,  thus  reducing  the  message
complexity.  On  the  other  hand,  the  distribution  within  an
extended zone can reduce the delay of validating new keys when
nodes outside a zone eventually enter the zone.

Key broadcasts are timed according to the network conditions
and  the  device  characteristics.  For  example,  a  node  can
rebroadcast  its  key  when  it  detects  a  substantial  change  of  the
topology of its zone; that is, if at least some percentage of nodes
has  departed  from  the  node's  neighborhood  since  the  last  key
broadcast.

The certificate vouches for the public key. Additionally, the
authenticity  and  freshness  of  the  PKD  packet  are  verified  by  a
signature  from  the  node  that  possesses  and  distributes  the  key.
The  PKD  sequence  number  is  set  to  the  next  available  value,
following the increasing values used for LSU packets. When the
LSU-based key broadcast is used, no additional PKD signature is
required.

Nodes  validate  PKD  packets  only  if  they  are  not  already
aware of the originator's public key. Upon validation, EV and the
corresponding  source  IP  address  are  stored  locally,  along  with
sequence  number.4  Each  node  can
the  corresponding 
autonomously decide whether to validate a key broadcast or not.
For  example,  if  it  communicates  with  a  nearby  destination,  it
might have no incentive to validate a PKD that originates from a
node at a large distance. Similarly, a validation could be avoided
if  the  node  considers  its  topology  view  broad  enough,  or
sufficient to support its communication. This could happen for a
dense network or zone, when not all physically present links are
necessary.

2.6. Protection from clogging DoS attacks

In  order  to  guarantee  the  responsiveness  of  the  routing
protocol,  nodes  maintain  a  priority  ranking  of  their  neighbors
according  to  the  rate  of  control  traffic  observed  by  NLP.  The
highest priority is assigned to the nodes generating (or relaying)
link state updates with the lowest rate and vice versa. Quanta are
allocated  proportionally  to  the priorities  and  non-serviced,  low-
                                               
4 This information is maintained in a FIFO manner. If the entire
sequence is covered, a new key is generated and distributed, after
the node voluntarily remains disconnected for a period equal to
NLPs neighbor_lost. This temporary disconnection ensures that
the  possible  change  of  the  nodes  IP  address  does  not  cause
neighbors to  perceive  this as a possible  attack  (i.e.,  spoofing  of
an IP address).

priority  packets  are  eventually  discarded.  Within  each  class,
updates are serviced in a round-robin manner.

Figure 2: PKD packet

Selfish  or  malicious nodes  that  broadcast  control  traffic  at  a
very  high  rate  are  throttled  back,  first  by  their  immediate
neighbors and then by nodes farther from the source of potential
misbehavior.  On  the  other  hand,  non-malicious  traffic,  that  is,
updates originating from benign nodes will be affected only for a
period  equal  to  the time  it takes to  update the  priority  (weight)
assigned to a misbehaving neighbor. In the meantime, the round
robin servicing provides the assurance that benign control traffic
will be relayed even amidst a "storm" of malicious or extraneous
updates.

Moreover,  malicious  floods  of  spurious  PKD  packets  are
countered by several mechanisms: (i) NLP imposes a bottleneck
thanks  to  the  lost  neighbor  timeout,  (ii)  PKD  packets  will  not
propagate more than R hops, unless they are carried farther by
adversaries  (e.g.,  when  they  dont  update  the  hops_traversed
field), (iii) nodes can autonomously decide whether to validate a
public key or not (e.g., for an very high R), and (iv) PKD packets
are also subject to restrictions imposed  by  the  above-mentioned
penalizing priority mechanism.

3. Discussion

SLSP 

remains  vulnerable 

to  colluding  attackers; 

two
malicious nodes M1, M2 may be able to convince nodes in  their
zones  of  a non-existent  (M1, M2)  link.  However,  it is  important
that any  coalition  of  adversaries  can  fabricate  connectivity  only
among  themselves.  Furthermore,  the  use  of  a  protocol  such  as
SMT  on  top  of  SLSP  will  promptly  reveal  such  forged  links,
unless  the  adversaries  relay,  i.e.,  tunnel  data  across  such  a
virtual link.

The use of public key cryptography may be a concern as well,
especially for resource-constrained devices. Clearly, SLSP nodes
should  be  able  to  perform  public  key  operations.  Since  nodes
periodically  generate  (sign)  updates  but  receive  (validate)
updates  more  frequently,  a  cryptosystem  with  the  properties  of
RSA would be preferable. Most importantly, SLSP provides for a

number  of  ways  nodes  can  minimize  their  processing  while
retaining  the  efficiency  of  the  topology  discovery.  First,  nodes
reduce  or increase  their  LSU  broadcast  period  according  to  the
network conditions. With the selection of the appropriate update
strategy, a reduced rate of broadcasts does  not affect  the  ability
of  nodes 
information.
Moreover,  only  a  small  fraction  of  PKD  packets  needs  to  be
validated  by  nodes.  Furthermore,  the  mechanisms  that  mitigate
clogging denial of service attacks ensure that spurious traffic will
not consume node resources.

to  maintain  up-to-date  connectivity 

4. Conclusions and future work

We  proposed  a  secure  link  state  protocol  (SLSP)  for  mobile
ad  hoc  networks.  SLSP  is  robust  against  individual  Byzantine
adversaries.  Its  secure  neighbor  discovery  and  the  use  of  NLP
strengthen SLSP against attacks that attempt to exhaust network
and  node  resources.  Furthermore,  SLSP  can  operate  with
minimal or no interactions with a key management entity, while
the credentials of  only  a  subset  of  network nodes  are necessary
for  each node  to  validate  the  connectivity  information  provided
by its peers.

The  securing  of  the  locally  proactive  topology  discovery
process by SLSP can be beneficial for MANET for a number of
reasons. The security mechanisms of SLSP can adapt  to a  wide
range  of  network  conditions,  and  thus  retain  robustness  along
with efficiency. As the next step of our research, we will present
a  detailed  performance  evaluation  of  SLSP,  both  independently
and as part of a hybrid framework (i.e., combine it with a secure
reactive  protocol),  and  for  various  network  instances  and  node
processing capabilities.
