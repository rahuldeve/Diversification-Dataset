McAfee Network Security 
Platform

A uniquely intelligent approach to network security

McAfee Network Security Platformpart of the Intel Security product 
offeringis a uniquely intelligent security solution that discovers and blocks 
sophisticated threats in the network. Using advanced threat detection 
techniques, it moves beyond mere pattern matching to defend against 
stealthy attacks with extreme accuracy, while its next-generation hardware 
platform scales to speeds of more than 20 Gbps with a single device to 
meet the needs of demanding networks. The Security Connected approach 
to security management streamlines security operations by combining 
real-time McAfee Global Threat Intelligence (McAfee GTI) feeds with rich 
contextual data about users, devices, and applications for fast, accurate 
response to network-borne attacks.

Protect Against Todays Stealthy Threats 
Your network faces advanced, stealthy attacks 
that can evade traditional detection methods, 
leaving your network exposed to crippling 
breaches and downtime. Unfortunately, most 
organizations lack the financial and operational 
resources to implement and manage the com-
bination of tools and technologies required to 
provide adequate defense.  

McAfee Network Security Platform is an 
integrated network security solution that 
combines next-generation threat prevention 
with intuitive security management to improve 
detection accuracy and streamline security 
operations. It provides industry-leading 
coverage against malware, zero-day threats, 
denial-of-service attacks, and botnets.

Unparalleled threat prevention 
McAfee Network Security Platform is based 
on a next-generation inspection architecture 
designed to perform deep inspection of 
network traffic while maintaining line-rate 
speeds. It uses a combination of advanced 

inspection techniquesincluding full protocol 
analysis, threat reputation, behavior analysis, 
and advanced malware analysis to detect and 
prevent both known and zero-day attacks on 
the network.

Comprehensive malware defense
No single malware detection technology 
can prevent all attacks, which is why McAfee 
Network Security Platform incorporates several 
advanced malware analysis techniques to 
prevent unwanted malware from wreaking 
havoc on your network. It combines file-
reputation from McAfee GTI, deep file analysis 
with JavaScript detection, and an advanced 
anti-malware engine to detect zero-day threats, 
custom malware, and other stealthy attacks.

Security Connected
Getting your hands on the data you need has 
never been easier. McAfee offers real-time 
integration with McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 
(McAfee ePOTM) software and McAfee Enterprise 
Security Manager for real-time correlation of 
network events across all relevant sources.

Through integration with McAfee ePO software 
and McAfee Enterprise Security Manager, 
McAfee Network Security Platform gets an 
accurate view of threats as they relate to 
devices and users and which ones present the 
greatest risk to the organization. The solution 
incorporates device details, user information, 
endpoint security posture, vulnerability assess-
ments, and other rich information to help 
organizations understand threat severity and 
business risk factors. 

Performance and scalability
Get the best of both worldssecurity and 
high performance. McAfee Network Security 
Platform combines a single-pass, protocol-
based inspection architecture with purpose-
built, carrier-class hardware to achieve real-
world inspection of more than 20 Gbps in a 
single device. Its ultra-efficient architecture 
preserves performance regardless of security 
settings, while other IPS solutions can 
experience up to 50% reduction in throughput 
with security over performance policies. 

Visibility and control
Make informed decisions about the applications 
and protocols on your network. McAfee 
Network Security Platform is the first and 
only IPS solution to combine advanced threat 
prevention and application awareness into a 
single security decision engine. We correlate 
threat activity with application usage, including 
layer 7 visibility of more than 1,500 applications 
and protocols, to allow you to make more 
informed decisions about which applications 
you allow on your network. In addition to 
application identification, McAfee Network 
Security Platform provides user and device 
visibility. It prioritizes risky hosts and users, 
including active botnets, through the identifica-
tion of anomalous network behavior. 

Intelligent security management
Make the most of your security investment 
through intelligent network security manage-
ment. McAfee Network Security Manager offers 
scalable web-based management from two to 
several hundred network security appliances. It 
offers intuitive progressive disclosure workflows 
that guide administrators to relevant alerts as 
well as easy-to-use security dashboards that 
automatically prioritize events based on alert 
severity and relevancy. McAfee Network Security 
Platform integrates with McAfee ePO software 

to give your organization a consolidated view of 
risk and compliance across the entire enterprise, 
including up-to-the-minute assessments of at-risk 
infrastructure based on system vulnerabilities, 
network defenses, and endpoint security levels.
