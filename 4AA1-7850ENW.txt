HPE Network Node Manager i
Network management software

HPE Network Node Manager i (NNMi) software provides powerful out-ofthe-box capabilities that enable your network operations team to efficiently
manage physical and virtual networks of massive scale. The HPE NNMi
Smart Plug-in add-on modules enhance NNMi’s awareness of specialized
network environments, providing your team with the information needed
to identify and fix problems more quickly.
In the Internet era, IP networks and hosted applications including those on virtualized
servers have become essential business enablers. For example, today’s networks support
end-user communication services, such as email and IP telephony, in addition to revenuegenerating transactions. Due to this strategic reliance on networks, companies cannot
afford network downtime.

Businesses must also stay competitive by making smart network management software
investments, including using automation. But even with automation, achieving some key
business requirements can remain elusive. Your network operations teams can have
difficulty finding a solution that incorporates some (but not all) of the following:
•	 Scalability to accommodate many large environments
•	 Multi-tenant capabilities to more securely manage multiple customers or sites
•	 Low cost of ownership
•	 Intelligent automation
•	 The ability to discover and monitor a modern virtualized infrastructure

Innovative technology
Workspaces and dashboards—visual workflows
With increased network complexity comes the problem of how to navigate network constructs.
Enter workspaces and dashboards. Workspaces provide purpose-based displays for groups
of managed elements. Dashboards provide guided workflow through a problem for and across
managed elements. Operators can easily move back and forth with the use of breadcrumbs.
In addition, NNMi provides unique ways to see virtualized constructs such as the hypervisor
wheel in Figure 3.

Figure 3. NNMi dashboard

At its core, NNMi software includes definitive root cause analysis (RCA) and continuous discovery.
Continuous discovery is important because if you are trying to investigate a problem and your
tool is telling you a connection goes between A and B (which it did yesterday) but now goes
from A to C, you will certainly come to the wrong conclusion due to no fault of your own.
Many solutions will discuss RCA, but NNMi’s RCA is definitive, which means it confirms a fault
by two methods, not just one used by many tools that can provide false positives.
Virtualization complicates network management
Virtualized environments are much more dynamic. Connections and relationships spin up and
down quickly, and therefore, they need to be managed immediately. When they are done, they
need to be gracefully removed. Further, they can move around; a virtual instance might be on
host A one moment and host B the next.

and loom (right)

NNMi provides out-of-the-box support for visualization and management of virtualized
infrastructure, allowing network operators to have a consistent view across their physical
and virtual infrastructure.
Exception-based management enhances productivity
NNMi software was specifically designed to increase the productivity of your network
operators. The NNMi GUI (graphical user interface) was designed around an exception-based
management paradigm, which enables you to focus on priority incidents quickly.
Features of the NNMi exception-based management paradigm include:
•	 User roles and node/interface grouping features enable you to focus NNMi views to
specific management domains and important nodes and interfaces within those domains.
•	 Out-of-the-box groupings for critical interfaces and nodes provide immediate visibility
to high-priority exceptions and reduce configuration time.
•	 Key incidents can be aligned with your environment, allowing you to define your
relevant, service-impacting events.
•	 Incident lifecycle management enables you to focus on assigned open incidents.

Reporting
NNMi provides detailed reporting to help you keep your network running smoothly for the long run.
Scheduled reporting and predefined reporting:
•	 Capacity planning
•	 Trend analysis
•	 Traffic engineering
Ease-of-use
From installation to operation, NNMi software is easy to use. For example, the NNMi quick-start
configuration wizard’s guided multistep configuration process enables rapid time to value for
most networks. Dashboards provide customizable visual workspaces to make managing specific
situations easier and more efficient.
NNMi automates on-demand diagnostics so pushing one button runs a series of
diagnostic actions to help determine the problem, and collects data immediately so that
no troubleshooting information is lost.
Level 1 operators now have the tools to solve many incidents that were previously passed
on to Level 2, increasing the efficiency of your staff.
Business benefits
•	 Reduce the cost of delivering improved network availability.
•	 Consolidate your network management infrastructure (for example, reduce the number
of management servers).
•	 Achieve low total cost of ownership with features such as wizards and a continuous discovery
process (for example, there is no need to regularly staff an episodic discovery process).
•	 Achieve greater staff productivity and efficiency with intelligent automation, an exceptionbased management paradigm, and a modern GUI.
•	 Reduce mean-time-to-repair (MTTR) with a deterministic and adaptive RCA and other
intelligent automation features.

NNM Smart Plug-ins (iSPIs)
iSPIs are optionally installable modules that bring extra intelligence, functionality, and value
to NNMi. Some iSPIs come with the NNMi Premium edition; all iSPIs come with the Ultimate
edition. Install only the plug-ins you need for your environment.
The plug-ins are:
•	 NNM iSPI Performance for Metrics (Premium/Ultimate)
•	 NNM iSPI Performance for Quality Assurance (Premium/Ultimate)

NNM iSPI Performance for Metrics
With the resiliency of today’s IP networks, fault and availability management is not enough.
Network performance problems are just as likely to affect a business. Therefore, an effective
management solution should incorporate network performance management, encompassing
device, interface, and link performance. As important as including performance management is,
how you incorporate it into your solution is equally critical. Management solutions must drive
increased productivity and efficiency. Disparate fault and performance solutions or loosely
integrated point tools require that operators toggle back and forth between separate systems.
Unified fault, availability, and performance management increase operator efficiency and
productivity. For example, the NNM iSPI Performance for Metrics allows NNMi to determine
and display the status of network interfaces from all three dimensions in one view. Additionally,
you can progress through a unified workflow to the NNM iSPI Performance for Traffic (Ultimate
only) to understand what types of traffic are flowing across these interfaces, and then drill down
in context to view out-of-the-box performance reports.

Figure 5. Performance data in the context of network topology HPE NNM Path,
Path Health report, and application flow report

Path Health performance report
A particularly powerful example of unified fault and performance management is illustrated by
the Path Health performance report (Figure 5). NNMi software calculates and visualizes the
Layer 2 and Layer 3 path between any two endpoints within the network. Then in concert, NNM
iSPI Performance for Metrics produces the Path Health performance report for all devices and
interfaces along that same path. NNM iSPI Performance for Traffic (Ultimate only) provides an
understanding of the types of application traffic flowing over these interfaces, and the NNM
iSPI for Quality Assurance notifies operators if service assurance tests configured for this path
are performing outside of acceptable ranges. This allows a unified workflow to troubleshoot
performance problems between endpoints, sites, and application pairs.
Business benefits
•	 Increase network availability by empowering operators with near-real-time and historical
performance management capabilities.
•	 Improve staff efficiency with workflows using contextual navigation between out-of-the-box
reports and rich interactive reporting, and troubleshoot problems more quickly through
unified fault, availability, and performance management.

NNM iSPI Performance for Quality Assurance
The NNM iSPI Performance for Quality Assurance (NNM iSPI Performance for QA) monitors
quality of network service levels discovered by Network Node Manager to ensure network
services are performing to the desired levels.
The NNM iSPI Performance for QA also provides the Intelligent Response Agent (iRA),
which monitors performance of such response probes on the Microsoft® Windows® and
Linux systems that NNMi is managing. This allows for more precise source-to-destination
tests and prevents additional load on critical network devices.
Business benefits
•	 Detect problems even when there are no users on the network so you can fix issues before
they affect users, and thereby increase network uptime.
•	 Discover and monitor QoS-enabled interfaces for exceptions and display them in the NNMi
console; reduce training on additional tools.

NNM iSPI Performance for Traffic
The NNM iSPI Performance for Traffic software (“Traffic”; Ultimate only) extends the capability
of NNMi to monitor how applications place loads on the performance of the network. It also
measures node-to-node traffic. For example, the network is running slow between point A and
B. By using Traffic, you can determine if a system backup is running during normal working
hours, instead of at night, and it is clogging the network and affecting other users. Knowing
the backup is the problem, you can take action to reduce its impact on the network and users.
Business benefits
•	 Receive data for capacity planning and traffic engineering.
•	 Maximize performance levels or reduce spend on overprovisioned links.

NNM iSPI for IP Telephony
NNM iSPI for IP Telephony (Ultimate only) provides comprehensive fault and availability
management of your business-essential IP telephony service. This iSPI provides discovery
and in-depth monitoring for the critical IP telephony infrastructure, including gateways, gateway
endpoints and channels, gatekeepers, and IP phones. It also improves efficiency by giving
telecom and data teams a common diagnostic and monitoring solution. The NNM iSPI for
IP Telephony supports Avaya, Cisco, and Nortel IP telephony systems.
Business benefits
•	 Increase IP telephony service availability by reducing mean time to identify and repair
voice service issues within the converged voice and data network.
•	 Increase operational efficiency and productivity for both voice and data teams
by standardizing on a unified management console.
•	 Reduce costs by leveraging existing HPE software investments (i.e., HPE NNMi software)
to manage the converged voice and data network.

NNM iSPI for IP Multicast
The NNM iSPI for IP Multicast (NNM iSPI MC; Ultimate only) extends NNMi to be aware of IP
multicast environments. It improves fault isolation for IP multicast applications by automatically
discovering and displaying views of multicast nodes and interfaces and their relationships, as
well as generating alarms based on events related to the multicast environment.
Business benefits
•	 Identify service problems early and improve the quality of multicast services through
proactive monitoring of IP multicasts and the health of multicast routers.
•	 Reduce the complexity of managing multicast services with general tools—and ultimately
operational costs—and increase uptime through rapid problem identification.

NNM iSPI for MPLS
The NNM iSPI for MPLS (Ultimate only) monitors multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)
service availability and inventory. In addition to traditional Layer 3 virtual private networks
(L3 VPN), the NNM iSPI for MPLS handles core, traffic-engineered, and pseudo-wire
management (L2 VPN).
Business benefits
•	 Improve uptime with continuous MPLS-specific core, Layer 2 and Layer 3 monitoring,
and alerting.
•	 Increase operator efficiency by consolidating MPLS with other network management
in the same tool.
•	 Reduce training by leveraging NNMi, a tool that your team is already familiar with.

NNM iSPI Network Engineering Toolset
NNM iSPI Network Engineering Toolset (NET; Ultimate only) delivers key tools and workflow
automation for network engineers and operators. It provides workflow automation from an
embedded limited-use version of HPE Operations Orchestration software. The NET also
provides trap analytic capabilities and topology export to Microsoft Visio. Both the tools and
the workflow automation save operators and engineers time when it is most valuable—during
a problem—resulting in faster repairs and less downtime.
Business benefits
•	 Improve time to repair by capturing problem information before the network changes
in a way that removes the data.
•	 Quickly resolve problems by finding where hosts with problems are connected to the network.
•	 Receive additional visualization and documentation via export of your NNMi topology
into Microsoft Visio; no extra tools required.
•	 Tune your management environment for efficient operations.

An integrated solution
NNMi software features a web service integration interface, which allows for feature-rich, flexible
integrations. Furthermore, NNMi software is delivered with out-of-the-box integrations to other
Hewlett Packard Enterprise software products (for example, HPE Network Automation software
and HPE Operations Orchestration software) for seamless workflows that increase productivity
and efficiency.
NNMi integrates with HPE Operations Manager i (OMi) by providing a qualified, authoritative
network event stream. This stream allows OMi to provide a unified view of events including
network events.
Another NNMi integration is with HPE Operations Analytics; this happens in two ways. First,
incidents forwarded to OMi are then forwarded to Operations Analytics. Further performance
data from NNMi goes directly to Operations Analytics for analysis.

Specifications and advanced features
NNM iSPI Performance for Metrics (Premium/Ultimate)
The iSPI Performance for Metrics in particular focuses on fundamental network interface
(SNMP MIB-II) and device component performance variables. It continuously collects, stores,
and manages performance-related metrics from across your network and includes multiple
prebuilt reports for exploring that data.
•	 NNM iSPI Performance for Metrics contains the Network Performance Server (NPS), which
is the central component for building and viewing network reports. NPS provides out-ofthe-box and highly customizable reporting across any iSPI domain.
•	 The highly scalable architecture of the NPS foundation handles up to 25,000 nodes and
500,000 performance-polled interfaces on a single server, storing the data for two years
at the most granular level. In addition, higher scalability can be achieved, with the Global
Network Manager (GNM) solution.
•	 NPS provides baseline metrics that define the normal or expected range of values for any
given metric. The baseline metrics enable you to forecast the future value of a metric on
the basis of historical data, as well as provide the ability to threshold on deviation from
normal situations.
•	 Tight integration between the NNMi operator console and the reporting interface provides
operators with seamless transitions from fault data to performance reports and back.
•	 Reduce network and device loads with unified performance polling, relative to disparate
collection processes; NNMi collects fault, availability, and performance data through the same
polling process.
•	 Establish the status of network devices and interfaces with unified status calculation and
visualization; NNMi uses fault, availability, and performance state information.
•	 NNM iSPI Performance for Metrics can be installed on the NNMi management server or on
a dedicated server. It can be distributed on multiple servers to share the processing load.
•	 Support for high availability clusters is available.
NNM iSPI Performance for QA (Premium/Ultimate)

NNM iSPI Performance for Traffic (Ultimate)
Traffic tracks and reports on all network traffic in an enterprise that is being collected
via the industry-standard protocols:
•	 NetFlow
•	 J-Flow
•	 sFlow
•	 IPFIX
It provides aggregated, detailed reports on the volume of traffic flowing between host servers,
which can be scoped by individual router interfaces. It can characterize all applications in the
system by means of powerful configurable rules and thus present an integrated view of packet
flow in the network.
Traffic consists of the Master and Leaf Collectors. Leaf Collectors collect the IP flow records
from different routers and forward the summarized data to the Master Collector. Leaf Collectors
can be installed in locations close to your devices configured to supply flow data. The Master
Collector then consolidates data from different Leaf Collectors and integrates with the Network
Performance Server (NPS). The NNMi extension for Traffic is the only component that must be
co-resident with NNMi itself.
Traffic reports on LAN, WAN, and VLAN virtualization; port aggregation; and equal cost
multipath (ECMP).
