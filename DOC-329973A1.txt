Internet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013 

 
Introduction.  This report summarizes information about Internet access connections over 200 kilobits 
per second (kbps) in at least one direction in service in the United States on December 31, 2013, as 
collected by FCC Form 477.  Form 477 gathers standardized information about subscribership to Internet 
access services in the fifty states, District of Columbia, and inhabited insular areas (American Samoa, 
Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands).  The information is reported by 
telephone companies, cable system operators, terrestrial wireless service providers, satellite service 
providers, and other facilities-based providers of advanced telecommunications capability.1  This is the 
eleventh report to include details about subscribership differences among census tracts and counties, as 
well as subscribership differences among the states.2   
 
Notable developments between December 2012 and December 2013 include: 
 

Internet connections overall are growing.  The number of connections over 200 kbps in at least 
one direction increased by 12% year-over-year to 293 million.   

 

 
 

In December 2013, there were 78 million fixed and 133 million mobile connections with 
download speeds at or above 3 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload speeds at or above 768 
kbps as compared to 65 million fixed and 65 million mobile connections a year earlier.  Figure 1 
illustrates the trend in connections speeds from December 2010 through December 2013, and 
Figure 2 presents a side-by-side comparison of fixed and mobile connection speeds in December 
2013.3    
 
 

1 See the Technical Notes and the Glossary that appear at the end of this report for more-detailed information about 
the Form 477 data collection and the meaning of terms used in this report.   

Readers should note two key aspects of the Form 477 data.  First, if service connections of different speeds are 
available to a particular consumer for purchase  from one or more suppliers  then only the purchased connection 
is counted by Form 477.  Second, the reported connection speed is typically the advertised speed of the purchased 
service, and it is possible that the purchased service will not operate at its advertised speed at all times.  The 
Commission has sponsored tests of actual consumer broadband speeds.  See, e.g., Federal Communications 
Commission, Office of Engineering and Technology and Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, 2014 
Measuring Broadband America Fixed Broadband Report (June 2014), available at www.fcc.gov/measuring-
broadband-america.   
2 Census tract-level data were first collected for December 2008.  For an overview of program history, see High-
Speed Services for Internet Access:  Status as of December 31, 2008 (February 2010) (December 2008 High-Speed 
Report) at pp. 1-4, available at http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/high-speed-services-internet-access-reports.  
Readers who are interested in historical trends in the Form 477 data should note the changes in reporting 
requirements that were effective in 2008 and earlier, in 2005.          

3 Reporting entities place connections into speed tiers defined by predetermined ranges of upload and download 
speeds.  Note that the Commission has decided to implement a different approach starting with data as of June 30, 
2014.  For each fixed product subscribed to in a census tract, the provider will report connections by the maximum 
advertised upload and download speeds of the product in that census tract.  For each mobile product subscribed to in 
a state, the provider will report connections by the minimum advertised upload and download speeds of the product 
in that state.  As the Commission explained, while the maximum advertised speed is a reasonably reliable indicator 
of the speed of fixed service that subscribers receive, a wireless service providers targeted minimum data speed in a 
market typically is a primary driver of the wireless network design that determines the market coverage boundaries.  
See Modernizing the FCC Form 477 Data Program, WC Docket No. 11-10, Report and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 9887, 
9908-09, 9915, paras. 42 n.138, 62 (2013) (June 2013 Form 477 Modernization Order).

                   Connections include both residential and business connections.  In December 2013, total connections were reported as 30%
                   residential fixed connections, 3% business fixed connections, 54% mobile connections to non-business subscribers, and 13%
                   mobile connections to business subscribers.

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     3  The number of connections with downstream speeds of at least 10 Mbps increased by 104% over 

December 2012, to 122 million connections,4 including 64 million fixed connections and 58 
million mobile connections.    
 

  Growth is particularly high in mobile Internet subscriptions.  The number of mobile subscriptions 
with speeds over 200 kbps in at least one direction grew to 197 million  up 16% from December 
2012.  The number of fixed-location connections at speeds over 200 kbps in at least one direction 
increased by 4% year-over-year to 96 million.     

 
 
Connection speeds in detail.  The Form 477 program categorizes reportable connections into 72 speed 
tiers defined by eight ranges of downstream and nine ranges of upstream speed.  In this overview 
discussion, we organize the extensive information collected for December 2013 into three groups of 
downstream speeds and three groups of upstream speeds.  We do this separately for fixed-location 
connections and for mobile connections.  As in previous reports, we use the Form 477 speed tier 
breakpoints of 3 Mbps and 6 Mbps to organize the information about downstream speeds, and we use the 
Form 477 speed tier breakpoints of 768 kbps and 1.5 Mbps to organize the information about upstream 
speeds.5   
 
 
connections reported for December 2013 were distributed across the three ranges of downstream speed 
defined by breakpoints at 3 Mbps and at 6 Mbps.

our narrative discussion of the speeds of mobile connections is summarized more concisely in Chart 5, at p. 22.    

The Commission benchmarked broadband as a transmission service that enables an end user actually to download 
Internet content at 4 Mbps and to upload Internet content at 1 Mbps over the service providers network.  That 
benchmark does not exactly match any Form 477 speed tier, and the Commission decided to evaluate the evidence 
of broadband availability using the Form 477-defined breakpoints of 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream to 
proxy the speed benchmark of 4 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream.  See Inquiry Concerning the Deployment 
of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, and Possible 
Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Amended by 
the Broadband Data Improvement Act, GN Docket Nos. 09-137, 09-51, Report, 25 FCC Rcd 95560, 9563, 9568,

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     8Providers by census tract by connection speed.  In Figure 5(a), we estimate the percentages of 
households located in census tracts where zero, one, two, or three or more providers reported residential 
fixed-location connections of several different speeds in December 2013.  In doing so, however, we 
emphasize that a provider that reports residential fixed-location connections of a particular speed in a 
particular census tract may not necessarily offer service at that speed everywhere in the census tract.  
Accordingly, the number of providers shown in Figure 5(a) does not necessarily reflect the number of 
choices available to a particular household, and does not purport to measure competition.  We note that 
the Commission has adopted changes to Form 477 that will enable a more precise analysis in future.10

10 The Commission is adding deployment information to Form 477 starting with data as of June 30, 2014, and the 
information about fixed broadband deployment will be reported by census block.  (There are approximately 11 
million census blocks and approximately 74,000 census tracts, although not all contain households.)  See June 2013 
Form 477 Modernization Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 9902-05, paras. 32-35. 

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     9In Figure 5(b), we estimate the percentages of households in census tracts where providers reported 
purchased residential fixed-location connections of different speeds or reported operating a mobile 
wireless network capable of sending or receiving data at the indicated speeds.  Again, we emphasize that 
such providers may not necessarily offer services at those speeds everywhere in the census tract, and that 
these data do not necessarily reflect competition.

about the adoption of fixed-location Internet access connections faster than 200 kbps in at least one 
direction for more than a decade.  Figure 6 illustrates the adoption of fixed-location Internet access 
connections (that is, all reportable connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction except mobile

  Between December 2003 and December 2013, total (business and residential) reportable fixed-

location connections grew from 28 million connections to 96 million connections  at a 
compound annual growth rate of 13% per year.12  

 

 

 

11 For data through December 2004, only those providers with at least 250 connections in a state were required to 
report.  Historical fixed-location connection counts not included in this report may be found in June 2008 High-
Speed Report at Tables 1 and 3, available in Excel format at http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/high-speed-services-
internet-access-reports.       

12 The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is a smoothed rate of growth calculated in three steps.  First, divide 
the ending (December 2013) value by the beginning (December 2003) value.  Second, raise the result of that 
division to a power equal to one divided by the number of years in the period (in this case, 10 years, so the power is 
1/10).  Third, subtract the number one from the result of the second step.   

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     11  Over the same ten-year period, residential fixed-location connections grew from 26 million 

connections to 88 million connections  also at a compound annual growth rate of 13% per year.   

  As we reported previously, between June 2003 and June 2013, household adoption  which we 
track in Figure 6 by comparing the number of residential fixed-location connections over 200 
kbps in at least one direction to the number of households  increased from 18 connections per 
100 households to 69 connections per 100 households.13    

 

 

 

 
Other report highlights. 

 
Residential subscribership 

  Residential fixed-location Internet access connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction 
increased by 4% between December 2012 and December 2013, to 88 million.  See Table 3.    

 
  Reported residential mobile wireless service subscribers with mobile devices and data plans for 
full Internet access increased by 21%, to 159 million, between December 2012 and December 
2013.  See Table 3.  

 
  The reported data show a 28% annual increase in the number of residential fixed-location 

connections that are at least 6 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream (from 38.1 million in 
December 2012 to 48.6 million in December 2013) and a 27% annual increase in the number of 
connections that are at least 10 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream (from 38 million in 
December 2012 to 48.3 million in December 2013).14  See Chart 12.   

 

13 See Internet Access Services:  Status as of June 30, 2013 (June 2014) at p. 12, available at 
http://www.fcc.gov/reports/internet-access-services-reports,  We calculated residential fixed connections per 100 
households using, in the denominator, U.S. household estimates from the Census Bureaus Current Population 
Survey (CPS) for July of each year and, for Puerto Rico and the other inhabited island areas, Census 2010 
households for 2010 and later years and Census 2000 households for the earlier years.  (The CPS also estimates U.S. 
households for March and November of each year.)  Ratios calculated for different dates or by using alternative 
household estimates will differ somewhat from the ratios reported in Figure 6.   

We also show total (including business as well as residential) fixed-location connections per 100 population in 
Figure 6, which we calculated using U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for the United States and Puerto Rico 
 which are as of July 1 each year  and, for the remaining inhabited island areas, Census 2010 population for 2010 
and later years and Census 2000 population for the earlier years.  This statistic, which is routinely reported by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), incorporates connections to business locations 
into a comparison to persons.  A more accurately measured indicator of this type would include only connections to 
residential locations, but OECD does not have comprehensive, consistent information about residential connections 
in the member countries.  (We note that the ratio of accurately measured residential fixed-location connections to 
population has a maximum value for any given country and point in time  the value when every household is 
connected  if we assume that no household would have more than one fixed connection to its premises.  For the 
United States in June 2013, for example, the maximum value would be 39 because there were about 125 million 
households in the United States and inhabited insular areas and a population of about 320 million according to the 
sources used for Figure 6.)      

14 These increases are largely due to a change in upstream-speed reporting by a single aDSL services provider.   
 

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     12Household adoption of faster speeds 

  As a national average in December 2013, there were 60 residential fixed-location connections per 
100 households for connections with speeds that were reported to be at least 3 Mbps downstream 
and 768 kbps upstream.15  See Table 13. 

 
Census tract and county shares of households with reportable connections 
 
  We estimate the share of households with fixed-location Internet access connections over 200 

kbps in at least one direction in individual census tracts and counties as of December 31, 2013.  
We continue to observe substantial variation among these estimates.  See Charts 15 and 16.   

 
  For both census tracts and counties, we continue to find estimates above 100% for the share of 
households with reportable fixed-location Internet access connections.  While this is likely to 
occur more frequently in areas where the number of housing units is substantially greater than the 
number of households, such as resort areas and beach communities, these results suggest that 
some filers are not accurately assigning customer connections to census tracts, and anecdotal 
evidence supports that conclusion.16    

Household adoption rates and subscribership demographics  

  The report includes charts that illustrate correlations between household subscribership, or 
adoption, rates and demographic measures.  We update charts based on income, household 
density, education, age, and race.  The data indicate that some demographic variables are 
correlated with the adoption of Internet access service.  See Charts 17-29.  

Maps of providers by census tract 
 
  Maps depict the number of providers of reportable connections by census tract:  (1) providers of 
total (combined residential and business) reportable fixed-location connections, (2) providers of 
residential reportable fixed-location connections, (3) providers of residential fixed-location 
connections at least 3 Mbps downstream and 768 kbps upstream, and (4) providers making 
reportable mobile wireless service available.17   

 

 

 

 

 

15 Increases over time in the ratio of residential fixed-location connections to households indicate that increasing 
shares of households are connected at home.  The ratio is somewhat different from the take rate of offered service 
(which may also be called an adoption rate) because, as discussed in connection with Figure 5(a), some 
households may be located in areas where no fixed-location service is offered.  These methodological differences 
are discussed in greater detail in Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability 
to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, and Possible Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant 
to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Amended by the Broadband Data Improvement Act, GN 
Docket No.11-121, Eighth Broadband Progress Report, 27 FCC Rcd 10342, 10386, para. 94 (2012).      

16 For example, while contacting Form 477 filers with questions about reported data, FCC staff continue to find 
situations in which all connections reported for a county have been assigned to a single, anomalous census tract. 

17 As discussed in the Technical Notes, a mobile wireless provider should only report service availability in census 
tracts where the provider operates a network capable of sending or receiving data at speeds above 200 kbps.         

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     13Remainder of the report.  The remainder of the report consists of tables, charts, and maps that highlight 
different aspects of Internet access service subscriptions.  This information is organized into four sections, 
as described below.  As always, publicly accessible data that are too voluminous to include in this report 
are available online at www.fcc.gov/wcb/iatd/comp.html.  
 

  Detailed Summary Statistics:  The Nation.  Tables 1-12 and Charts 1-14 focus in order on:  

number of connections, speed of connections, technology of connections, and number of 
providers.      

 
  Detailed Summary Statistics:  The States.  Tables 13-21 present comparable information for the 

individual states and our estimates of the shares of households that are connected at different 
speeds.   

  Detailed Summary Statistics:  Counties and Census Tracts.  Charts 15-16 and Tables 22-26 

present information about differences among counties and census tracts.  This section concludes 
with two maps that illustrate differences among census tracts in the estimated share of connected 
households and the four maps (discussed above) that illustrate providers by census tract. 

 

 

  Detailed Correlation Results:  Demographic Measures.  Charts 17-29 present details of the 

correlations observed between the estimated share of connected households and demographic 
measures.

Cumulative

Not Cumulative

This chart shows cumulative and non-cumulative subscribership ratios by income deciles.  Counties were grouped into income deciles based on county median household income in 2009, as reported by the
Census Bureau.  For each decile, the height of any red, non-cumulative bar represents the ratio of the sum of residential fixed connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction across counties in the
decile to the sum of households across counties in the decile.  The height of the blue, cumulative bar for decile N represents the ratio of the sum of residential fixed connections over 200 kbps in at least
one direction across all counties in decile N and all deciles less than N to the number of households in all the counties in decile N and deciles less than N.

Wherever a number of providers is cited in this report, multiple Form 477 filers within a holding 
company structure count as one provider. 
 
Form 477 collects information about Internet access connections in service to end-user locations that are 
advertised to deliver information to and/or from the end user  that is, in at least one direction  at transfer 
rates (speeds) above 200 kilobits per second (kbps).  Information is collected about connections in 72 
speed tiers (nine upstream tiers and eight downstream) defined by ranges of upstream speeds and 
downstream speeds.  Connections are further categorized by the technology employed by the part of the 
connection that terminates at the end-user location.   
 
End users are residential, business, institutional, or government entities who use services for their own 
purposes and who do not resell such services to other entities.  Facilities-based providers report 
information about connections they provide directly to their own end-user customers and also connections 
that they provide to Internet Service Providers for resale to end users.  For Form 477 purposes, the 
facilities-based provider of a connection is the entity that owns the portion of the physical facility that 
terminates at the end-user location, obtains an unbundled network element (UNE), special access line, or 
other leased facility that terminates at the end-user location and provisions/equips it as a connection that 
transfers information at rates over 200 kbps in at least one direction, or provisions/equips a wireless 
channel that transfers information at rates over 200 kbps in at least one direction to the end-user location 
over licensed spectrum or over spectrum that the provider uses on an unlicensed basis.  
 
The mutually exclusive Form 477 technology categories are:  asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line 
(aDSL in this report), symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (sDSL), other wireline, cable modem, 
optical fiber to the end-user premises (FTTP), satellite, fixed wireless (using licensed or unlicensed 
spectrum), mobile wireless (using licensed or unlicensed spectrum), electric power line, and all other 
(which is included to capture deployment of additional technologies over time).  In the Form 477 data 
collection, aDSL-based services delivered over fiber-to-the-node architecture are reported in the aDSL 
category.  The other wireline category comprises T1/DS1, T3/DS3, and other copper-based connections, 
not elsewhere categorized, that deliver Internet access service at the end-user location.  Ethernet 
connections delivering Internet access service are reported in the other wireline category if the connection 
terminates over copper and in the FTTP category if the connection terminates over fiber.  Connections 
deployed over hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) architecture are reported in the cable modem category.  Wireless 
ISPs (WISPs) report in the fixed wireless category if providing service to dispersed, fixed end-user 
locations and report in the mobile wireless category if providing a commercial service that can be 
received at any location within a service footprint.  Wireless local area networks (such as Wi-Fi hotspots) 
that only enable local distribution and sharing of a premises connection are not included, although the 
shared premises connection is included. 
 
Numbers of connections presented in this report are not adjusted for the number of persons at a single 
end-user location who have access to, or who use, the Internet access services delivered over the 
connection to that location. 
 

U.S. Federal Communications CommissionInternet Access Services:  Status as of December 31, 2013     79Numbers of residential connections are estimated based on the total connections and percentage-
residential connections information reported on Form 477.   
       
Census tracts 
 
Starting with data as of December 31, 2008, facilities-based providers of reportable fixed-location 
Internet access connections must report connection counts and percentage residential information at the 
census tract level of detail.  Because of the inherent mobility of their service, facilities-based mobile 
wireless providers do not report subscriber counts by census tract.  Instead, they report the census tracts in 
the state that best represent the areas where service is available over the providers own network, for each 
of the speed tiers in which the provider offers service. 
 
The census tract-level data summarized in this report were collected for tracts in the 2010 decennial 
census.  For the purposes of this report, there are 73,767 census tracts because we exclude census tracts 
delineated specifically to cover large bodies of water.   
 
About 110 of the census tracts have population but no households because the population resides in group 
living quarters.  For the purpose of estimating residential subscribership rates by census tract, we assume 
these census tracts have no reportable residential Internet access service because persons residing in 
group quarters would have Internet access over a business connection provided to the operator of the 
group quarters.  Therefore, these census tracts are included in the zero column. 
 
Ratios of residential fixed-location connections to households that exceed 100% 
 
We estimate the share of households with fixed-location connections in individual census tracts by taking 
the ratio of the reported number of fixed-location residential service connections to the estimated number 
of households.  We continue to find outlier estimates at or above 100% and to find that the number of 
outliers is substantially reduced when estimates are made for individual counties rather than for individual 
census tracts.   
 
Possible explanations of ratios at or above 100% include (1) geocoding misallocations of service locations 
to census tracts; (2) proper allocation of connections to the county level by some filers, but improper 
allocation of all connections to a single tract in the county; (3) possible overestimation of residential 
connections in service plans for which the customer base is primarily residential; and (4) connections at 
seasonally or occasionally occupied housing units, such as vacation homes, while the household is 
counted elsewhere.  Most of the numbers of households in census tracts that were used to generate the 
estimated ratios are themselves estimates (from GeoLytics, Inc.), which could have an independent effect.  
     
Maps showing residential subscribership rates by census tract 
 
The two maps based on estimated Internet access connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction per 
1,000 households (that is, estimated household subscribership rates) exclude all connections identified as 
business connections and necessarily exclude residential mobile wireless connections (which are reported 
for the state but not for individual census tracts).
