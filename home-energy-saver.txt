Abstract
The Home Energy Saver (HES, http://HomeEnergySaver.lbl.gov) is an interactive web
site designed to help residential consumers make decisions about energy use in their
homes. This report describes the underlying methods and data for estimating energy
consumption. Using engineering models, the site estimates energy consumption for six
major categories (end uses); heating, cooling, water heating, major appliances, lighting,
and miscellaneous equipment. The approach taken by the Home Energy Saver is to
provide users with initial results based on a minimum of user input, allowing
progressively greater control in specifying the characteristics of the house and energy
consuming appliances. Outputs include energy consumption (by fuel and end use),
energy-related emissions (carbon dioxide), energy bills (total and by fuel and end use),
and energy saving recommendations. Real-world electricity tariffs are used for many
locations, making the bill estimates even more accurate. Where information about the
house is not available from the user, default values are used based on end-use surveys and
engineering studies. An extensive body of qualitative decision-support information
augments the analytical results.

1. Introduction
The Home Energy Saver (HES, http://HomeEnergySaver.lbl.gov) is an interactive web site
designed to help residential consumers make decisions about energy use in their homes. Its aims
are to increase consumer interest in energy efficiency and to foster market activities that capture
those opportunities. The site is developed and maintained by the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory with sponsorship (past and/or present) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE),
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the California Energy Commission.
Development of the Home Energy Saver began in 1994, and the site first went on-line in 19961,
originally sponsored by the ENERGY STAR program, operated by EPA and DOE (Mills 1997)2.
The Home Energy Saver uses state-of-the-art data and models to support the Federal energy
mission by helping to build national recognition of Federal energy efficiency programs and by
enabling consumers to quantify the energy savings and environmental benefits that can be
achieved by improving the energy efficiency of their home. The site is also used periodically by
researchers, designers and contractors as a tool for analyzing residential energy performance
issues, and for learning from actual homeowners about their experiences with implementing
energy-saving upgrades. Finally, through the Energized Learning module, science educators at
the high school and college level regularly use HES as part of their science curricula
(http://EnergizedLearning.lbl.gov). As of August 2004, there are approximately 460,000 toppage visits per year. Based on a user-feedback form, submitted thus far by approximately 1100
users, approximately 80% of users are homeowners or renters, with the balance made up of those
who visit for professional/educational reasons, such as building professionals, educators,
contractors etc.
The Home Energy Saver provides two basic services to the residential consumer
• A calculation of energy consumption by end use, for the entire household
• Estimate of energy bills based on end use consumption, and a comparison of
consumption to a “typical” household and subsequent recommendations for bill
reduction.
In this report, we first provide a description of the method for calculating energy consumption,
and the levels of input detail available to the user and the output reported to the user. We then
describe the calculation of energy bills based on consumption. Finally, we document the
presentation by which consumers can compare results for their household to households typical
in their geographical area, and which suggest possibilities for energy bill reduction. The report
includes appendices that describe the user interface and software/hardware architecture
underlying the site3.

An earlier version developed at LBNL was called WebCalc.
In 2000, the ENERGY STAR program sponsored the development of a simplified consumer web site derived from
the HES, called Home Energy Advisor (Advisor, http://hit.lbl.gov). In most cases, Advisor uses the same data and
calculation methodologies as HES, but employs a more constrained building description and provides different
outputs

A companion report (Warner 2005) describes the use of the DOE-2.1E simulation model for handling space
conditioning.

The goal in developing the Home Energy Saver web site has been to provide consumers with a
simple way to use state-of-the-art residential energy calculation tools and energy data. The site
integrates a variety of models, algorithms, and data sources developed over several decades at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, other DOE National Labs, utilities, and elsewhere in
the energy community. Historically, access to and use of such materials has required more
extensive expertise and knowledge of energy and building technologies than that possessed by
consumers. Making these tools and information available via a web-based interface, enables lay
users to obtain energy use and savings estimates tailored to their particular home, climate,
lifestyles, etc. While not discussed further here, the site also provides extensive “decisionsupport” information to accompany the analytical results (via the “Librarian” and “Making it
Happen” modules).
Consumer-oriented home energy calculators are most effective if they combine careful energy
analysis with energy cost information in a fashion that yields meaningful energy bills. Energy
tariffs (particularly those for electricity) are becoming increasingly complex, as they are
redesigned to encourage efficient use of energy at the margin and management of peak demand.
For example, the so-called “inverted block tariffs” present the user with an increasing per-unit
electricity price as consumption rises. “Time-of-Use” tariffs present the user with high electricity
prices at times when the utility system is likely to be facing peak demands (e.g. weekday
afternoons during summer), and correspondingly low prices at off-peak times. Most energy
calculators utilize highly stylized prices (e.g. a flat cents-per-kilowatt-hour value), which fail to
capture the real-world conditions facing consumers. To address this void, the Home Energy
Saver site includes a process to model electricity bills using actual utility tariffs.
1.1. Limitations and Advantages of Web-based Energy Modeling
• State – Unlike a computer based application, the web based environment does not
maintain a constant connection between a user and the application. For each new action,
the web server must be given information to connect a user with their particular session,
in the form of cookies or a session ID. If this information expires, the user is required to
start the process over.
•

Network Latency and Errors – the internet is a conglomeration of servers, routers and
transmission paths that are largely independent of each other. Delays or lack of service in
any part can make it appear to a user that our site is unavailable or slow. To a great
extent, the internet compensates for outage and bottlenecks by re-routing traffic to areas
with greater capacity, but some bottlenecks can’t be avoided, such as the link from the
user’s computer to their ISP.

•

User comprehension – energy modeling is a complex process, and has its share of
technical language. We’ve attempted to use common language in parsing inputs and
results, but misunderstandings and confusion can still occur. The lack of a trained
professional on hand to assist may limit some users experience.

Advantages include ease of distribution, version control, platform independence and the ability
to locate computation-intensive simulation engines such as DOE-2 on a central (free to the
public) server, rather than requiring users to install and administer them on home personal
computers.

2. User Interface
The Home Energy Saver was the first Internet-based tool for calculating energy use in residential
buildings. The approach taken by the web site is to provide users with results based on a
minimum of user input, and then, for those interested in continuing, allowing them progressively
greater degrees of control in specifying the house and energy consuming appliances
characteristics. This allows users with limited knowledge or time to access results that are
generally applicable to their situation, while more informed or persistent users can get greater
accuracy and relevance by customizing their house description. This design philosophy results in
a progressive three-tiered approach to estimating energy consumption.
At the initial level of inputs, users are asked solely for their zip code (Figure 1). An initial set of
results are immediately derived from the zip code input. These results are averages for the
housing stock in their region, based on the 2001 Residential Energy Consumption Survey
(RECS) (US DOE. 2004). HES also presents potential savings for a typical house in that region.
Simultaneously, users are shown the questions for the second, “simple inputs” level of the Home
Energy Saver (Figure 2). This set of questions focuses on those appliances and housing
characteristics that cause large variance in energy consumption (e.g. floor area, heating
equipment, etc.). These key inputs can be used to refine the energy estimation further.
After answering the questions in the “simple inputs” level of HES, users can either calculate the
energy used by their house (Figures 3 to 5) based on the description provided by the “simple
level” of questions or further refine the house description before calculating by accessing the
third, “detailed inputs” level of the model. In the detailed input pages, they can adjust nearly all
of the envelope, site and appliance characteristics that go into estimating energy consumption for
their home.
When the user is satisfied with the house description, they calculate the energy consumption,
which replaces the prior default results based on a house in their area. At this time they can also
view more detailed reports (Figures 6 and 7).
For both the “simple inputs” and “detailed inputs” levels, the models used to estimate energy
consumption are identical, with user-entered values substituting for default values as the user
progresses through the “detailed inputs” level. There are six major categories (end-uses) where
energy consumption is estimated; heating, cooling, water heating, major appliances, lighting, and
miscellaneous equipment. The Home Energy Saver uses engineering models to estimate energy
consumption for all these end-uses.
2.1 Entry Page
The entry point to the calculation process is through the main page of the Home Energy Saver
website. In addition to all of the informational content about energy efficiency, the users can
choose to enter their ZIP code and initiate a session, or enter their session number from a
previous visit, which will return them to the results of that session.

Figure 1. Entry Page for Home Energy Saver Website.

2.2. Initial “Simple” Inputs Page with ZIP-Code-Based Bill
After entering a zip code, the users see the first page, which shows the average energy
consumption for a typical house in their area, taken from the Residential Energy Consumption
Survey (RECS) (US DOE 2004), see Section 4.1 for details on how this average bill was
generated. The lower half of the screen shows the questions for the “simple” level of calculation
(Figure 2). Users have the choice of calculating the bill for their house, based on those questions,
or providing more detail about their house before calculating. By answering the detailed
questions (below the bar chart in Figure 2), users get results calculated using a house description
that more closely matches their house.

2.3. Error Handling
2.3.1 User Input Validations
Where appropriate, the user interface is designed with javascript and occasionally using serverside input validations to ensure that the answer submitted by the user is valid. There are two
main types of javascript validations, the first prevents non-valid characters from being typed into
text boxes (e.g. alphabetic characters not allowed in an integer text field), while the second
checks the final value against the allowable range (e.g. percentage values must be between 0%
and 100%). Additionally in a few instances, there are server side validations that check inputs for
more complicated problems (e.g. window area is greater than wall area when framing members
and area of doors is included). When an error is noted, a message is displayed to the user,
identifying the problem and asking them to correct their inputs.
2.3.2 Failures in the DOE-2.1 Calculation
On occasion, a dropped network connection or an inappropriate house description can cause the
DOE-2 engine to experience failure. The Home Energy Saver has error traps in place to prevent
the loss of data in a situation where there is a DOE-2 failure. After the results of the DOE-2 run
are returned to the web application, the returned energy consumptions are tested for valid values.
If an error is detected, the web application discards the returned values, continuing the
calculation with the previous energy consumptions for heating and cooling. If results are not
returned from DOE, the application again reverts to previously stored data.
2.4. Results Page
After the energy calculations are complete, users are presented with a new page showing the
condensed results of the calculation (Figure 3). The top half of the page now contains results
generated from their house description (rather than a typical house in their area). The more
detailed results page (Figure 4) shows a list of possible retrofits for their house, based on the
current house description, ranked by payback time, as well as links to tips and other reports about
the user’s energy use and information on how to save energy. Subsidiary pages show monthly
energy use by major end use and electricity by time-of-use (TOU) period (for cases where the
user has specified a TOU tariff (Figure 5).

The Home Energy Saver utilizes data from a variety of sources to provide default input values
and energy consumption. The bulk of the data compilation for the Home Energy Saver was
completed in 1997-1999, and the most current data available at that time was used. For timesensitive series such as equipment efficiencies, the final data point has been used to provide
values for subsequent years. The only exception to this is for the state energy prices, which have
been updated to use the most current data available at the time of this report.

3.1 Heating and Cooling Calculation
This section deals with the determination of heating equipment efficiencies, thermal distribution
(air or hydronic) efficiencies, infiltration, and thermostat management. The energy consumption
for most types of heating and cooling equipment is estimated using the DOE-2 building
simulation program (version 2.1E), developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (Birdsall et al.,
1990). A companion report (Warner 2005) describes the thermodynamic modeling of the home,
and the relevant characterizations of the building’s thermal envelope (windows, insulation, etc.)
The program performs a sophisticated series of calculations, modeling the energy consumption
in the user’s house in a full annual simulation for a typical weather year (involving 8760 hourly
calculations). Users can choose from approximately 285 weather locations around the United
States. Energy use for some heating and cooling equipment types are estimated independently of
DOE-2 and are documented in this report. Interactions between space-conditioning equipment
and the waste heat from occupants and appliances are also treated in the modeling process.
User inputs (or defaulted values, where user-entered values aren’t available) are gathered
together and sent to the DOE 2.1E model to calculate the heating and cooling (and water heating
if user specified that water heating was tied to a central boiler system) energy consumption. The
DOE 2.1E model requires inputs on the location (longitude, latitude, altitude, etc.) and climate (a
specified “weather city” corresponding to a TMY, TMY2 or CTZ weather tape) of the house;
general information about the house (orientation, stories above ground level, ceiling height,
house shape and dimensions, etc.); construction details about the house
(roof/ceiling/wall/floor/foundation construction details; type, size, shading and location of
windows, skylights and doors; external shading (garage location, size of surrounding trees);
details on the heating and cooling equipment (equipment type, efficiency, duct location,
thermostat type and settings); and information about occupants and other sources of internal
gains.
3.1.1 Weather Modeling
When users enter their ZIP code, they are assigned a default city to provide a weather data file
for DOE-2 modeling. This assignment was done using a geographic information system (GIS)
analysis to locate ZIP codes that are “closest” to cities with associated weather data (Weather
Cities). These Weather Cities are listed in Appendix C. To represent the climatic variation
across the U.S., we used The Nature Conservancy (TNC) “Ecoregions” (TNC 2001) to associate
each Zip Code with an appropriate Weather City based on climate and environment, as well as
linear distance.
The Nature Conservancy has created a set of GIS layers delineating EcoRegions on four different
scales. The two smallest scales — the Province and the Section — were used in this analysis.
These EcoRegions describe areas with relatively homogeneous environmental factors such as
temperature, precipitation, humidity, vegetation, and landscape features. While not all these
factors are directly related to building energy use, the predominant factors are climate-related
and thus highly correlated with building energy use. On visual inspection, we also chose to use
the EcoRegions because they correlate well with other climate regions used in energy analysis
(e.g., the CEC climate zones) and are available nationally at a fine spatial scale. See Figure 8 for
examples of the EcoRegions used in this analysis. See http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/ecolink.html

for further description of the ecoregion concept. ZIP code boundary data were obtained from the
U.S. Census Bureau (2004)
Figure 9. Example EcoRegions in the Western U.S.

Source: . (TNC 2001).
Note that Sections (right) are subdivisions of Provinces (left).

To assign ZIP codes, we found the closest Weather City that is also within the same Ecoregion as
that ZIP code. For each ZIP code, we first tried to do this matching at the Ecoregion “Section”
(smallest scale) level, but if there was no matching Weather City we would then match at the
Province level. If no match was possible at the Province level, we simply used the closest
weather city (in geographic distance). Distances were based on ZIP code centroid to city center.
Finally, the matches were reviewed and adjusted manually.
For use in modeling water heating energy consumption, we estimate the annual average inlet
water temperature (from the domestic water system) by subtracting 2˚F from the annual average
dry-bulb air temperature reported in the weather data files. Inlet water temperatures in Alaska
were constrained to be greater than 32 degrees Farenheit. These values are listed in Appendix C.
Summary weather statistics for each weather data file were calculated using the DOE-2 weather
packing routines. These summary statistics include seasonal heating and cooling degree-days,
winter and summer design-day conditions, and weather-station location data. DOE-2 utilizes the
full TMY2 weather tape, extracting solar gains (insolation) and other needed information for use
in the annual simulation.
3.1.2 Default House Characteristics
To assist users with describing the characteristics of their house, when users first enter the Home
Energy Saver site, they are assigned default house characteristics based on the Census Division
in which their ZIP code is located. These default characteristics were developed by analyzing
16

the 1993 and 2001 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata4 (US DOE
1995a, US DOE 2004). Consumption and characteristics are based on RECS 2001 supplemented
by lighting and electrical cooking consumptions from RECS 1993. All analysis is based on a
subset of homes; mobile homes and single family homes (both attached and unattached). Where
a house characteristic can only have discrete values (e.g., type of heating fuel or presence of
dishwasher), we tabulated the saturation of that characteristic in the RECS data set and selected
the most common value. For example, if natural gas was the most common heating fuel in a
region, then the default house is assumed to use natural gas for heating. Appendix A. Default
House Characteristics contains the default input values for each census division. For the
remaining characteristics for the house, a single value was applied across all divisions. Table A-2
contains these nation-wide default housing characteristics. Default house shell characteristics, for
use in DOE-2, are described in the DOE-2 companion report (Warner 2005).

** Capacity for this equipment type is automatically calculated in the DOE-2.1 model.

For those equipment types modeled in DOE-2, the equipment characteristics (default values

3.1.3.1 Heating Equipment Efficiency
In the detailed inputs level of the model, users can select the purchase year for their heating and
cooling systems as an alternative to entering an efficiency value for the equipment. In these
cases, we derive a shipment-weighted efficiency based on the purchase year of the equipment
(Table 4 and Table 5). A shipment-weighted efficiency is the average efficiency for all units sold
within a particular year weighted by the number of units in each efficiency bin (AHAM 1996).
Efficiencies for furnaces are measured as AFUE, or Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency rating,
which represents the seasonal or annual efficiency of the furnace. Heat pumps efficiency is
shown as HSPF, Heating Seasonal Performance Factor.

3.1.3.2 Cooling Equipment Efficiencies
The cooling efficiency for Central Air Conditioners and Electric Heat Pumps are rated by the
seasonal efficiency of the equipment or SEER. Room Air Conditioners are rated by EER or
Energy Efficiency Ratio, the ratio of the cooling output (in BTU) divided by the electrical energy
consumption (in watt-hours).

3.1.3.3 Room Air Conditioner Consumption
Room air conditioners tend to be operated not by central thermostatic control, but rather in a
manual mode where the room occupant turns the air conditioner on and off depending on room
temperature and occupancy. These complex operating patterns are difficult to model with
thermal simulation models such as DOE-2. For this reason, we chose to use a simpler method
for estimating room air conditioner energy consumption, based on the AHAM (Association of
Home Appliance Manufacturers) test procedure. This method is summarized in Equation 1.

Energy-efficiency ratio (Btu/kWh)

Because cooling loads and usage vary with climate, we estimate a default days and hours/day
value for each of the cities for which we had weather data (Appendix C-1). We estimate the
default daily operating hours using equation 2. These values are rounded to the nearest integer.
Climate data used in this equation are drawn from the typical meteorological year (TMY2)
weather tapes (Marion and Urban 1995). The first term in equation 2 accounts for the severity of
the climate, in terms of dry bulb temperature, while the second term accounts for how humid the
climate is. Note that the humidity term is assumed to equal zero for locations above 40ºN
latitude. The parameters in equation 2 were estimated heuristically so as to yield results that
looked reasonable across a range of climates.

We then derive a value for annual RAC compressor hours from the AHAM test procedure
manual (AHAM 1982). We used the value corresponding to 66% of full-load, to account for
some cycling that occurs in normal room air conditioner operation (These values are shown in
Appendix C-1. Where one of our weather cities was not listed in the AHAM document, the
Cooling Load Hour value shown in Appendix C-1 is extrapolated from the geographically
closest city, using the TMY2 cooling-degree hours at 74º F as a scaling factor.
Finally, the average days per year of operation is simply the ratio of annual compressor hours to
the average daily hours of operation.
21

Room air conditioner capacity is either input by the user or a national-average typical value is
used (12,000 Btu/hour). EER is also either user-entered or drawn from the shipment-weighted
average for the year in which the air conditioner was sold (as specified by the user).
3.1.4 Thermostats and Thermostat Schedules
The Home Energy Saver is capable of modeling both standard and programmable thermostats.
The default thermostat assigned to a new session is a standard thermostat with the default
schedule and temperature settings outlined in Table 6. Users can adjust the temperature and time
schedules for the two periods (day and night), and can specify a separate schedule for weekdays
and weekends/holidays.

Alternatively, users can choose a programmable thermostat, which defaults to the schedule
outlined in Table 7. As with a standard thermostat, users can specify alternate times and
temperatures for the four periods, to differentiate between weekday and weekend/holiday
schedules.

The thermostat schedule is sent as an input to the DOE-2 calculation engine where it is used in
calculating energy consumption by the heating and cooling equipment.
3.1.5 Internal Gains
Anything producing heat as a waste product affects the heating and cooling loads within the
house. The waste heat causes an increase in the cooling energy consumption, and a decrease in
the heating energy consumption. The Home Energy Saver accounts for internal gains by passing
information about internal heat loads to the DOE-2 building simulation engine. Information
about the number of occupants and the energy consumption for lighting and appliances,
including water heater (when located in conditioned space), for all equipment located within the
conditioned space is sent as internal gains to DOE-2. This value also reflects waste heat from gas
appliances located within the conditioned space.
3.1.6 Thermal Distribution Efficiency
As documented in a companion report (Warner 2005), the Home Energy Saver uses the hourly
DOE-2 thermal simulation model to estimate heating and cooling consumption. The treatment of
air distribution duct losses in DOE-2 is very simple, allowing only a single value of duct losses
(expressed as a percent of air input to the ducts) that applies to every hour throughout the year.
22

Although it would be desirable to model duct efficiency as varying throughout the year, as a
function of the ducts' environmental conditions, this would require a significant effort in
modifying DOE-2.
Instead, we use an annual-average method for estimating the effect of duct materials and the type
of space in which the majority of their duct system is located, since duct losses differ
significantly depending on these factors. We used the ASHRAE 152P duct model to estimate
duct losses for use as an input to DOE-2 (ASHRAE 1997a). Although this model is intended to
calculate seasonal duct efficiencies based on detailed diagnostic testing, we assumed typical
values for most of the inputs (such as duct surface area and number of return ducts) so that the
number of inputs required of the user is more reasonable.
Users are able to specify whether or not the ducts are insulated and/or sealed, and the duct
location. Insulated ducts are assumed to have R-5 insulation, while uninsulated ducts are
assigned an insulation value of R-1 (to account for the thermal resistance of the external air film
on the ducts). Unsealed ducts are assumed to have a leakage of 30% of the total air handler flow,
based on field testing in existing California homes (Jump et al. 1996). Because concerted duct
sealing efforts can typically reduce leakage by one-half, we assume that sealed ducts have a
leakage rate of 15%. If users choose not to specify their duct location, we infer the location
based on the type of foundation and typical building practices. Table 8 shows the default duct
location that corresponds to each of the foundation types available in HES.

Foundation Type

Assumed Duct Location

Ventilated Crawlspace

Slab-on-grade

To account for the effect of local climate on ducts located in unconditioned spaces, the ASHRAE
152P model uses design-day weather data from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals
(ASHRAE 1997b). The model inputs are the winter 97.5% design dry-bulb and the summer
2.5% design dry-bulb, shown in Table C-1.
The ASHRAE 152P model generates seasonal duct efficiencies for both the heating and cooling
seasons, which are then averaged together using weights corresponding to the HDD and CDD in
that location, normalized to the national average degree-days (using TMY2 data). These
weighting factors are shown in Appendix C-1, in the “duct factor” columns. A single annual
average duct efficiency is passed to the DOE-2 model as an input to the hourly thermal
simulation. This annual duct efficiency is determined based on the type of heating and cooling
equipment in the house. The logic for determining the annual duct efficiency is captured in Table
23

2 by the intersection of heating columns and cooling rows based on the presence or absence of
ducts for each type of equipment.

3.1.6.1 Boiler Pipe Efficiency
Boiler pipes are assumed to have a baseline efficiency of 90% (Wenzel 1997). Users are able to
indicate whether their pipes are insulated. For insulated pipes we stipulate a 5% increase in
efficiency.
3.1.7 Infiltration
Air infiltration can be a significant component of thermal losses in residential buildings. In the
Home Energy Saver, we calculate the energy impact of air infiltration in the DOE-2 simulation
model, based on the leakage area of the thermal shell and location-specific weather data.
Although leakage area can be measured using diagnostic testing, few homeowners know the
leakage area of their home. To compensate for this lack of information, we estimate leakage area
using a database of measured leakage values compiled by LBNL. This database has been
analyzed to provide average leakage values for single-family homes based on a few key
parameters that strongly influence air leakage (Sherman and Matson 1997, Matson 1998). The
LBNL leakage database reports leakage values as Normalized Leakage (NL), or square feet of
leakage area per 1000 square feet of conditioned floor area. For input to DOE-2, we converted
these normalized leakage values to fractional leakage areas (FLA) using equation 3.
FLA =

stories = 1 if single-story house, otherwise stories = 2
8 = Assumed ceiling height (feet) for the house
0.3048 = conversion factor feet to meters
Source: Sherman, et. al. 1997
The key parameters used to select a house's leakage value from the database are: house vintage
(pre-1980, 1980 and later), stories (1, more than 1), shell condition (whether or not air leaks have
24

been sealed in a comprehensive way), presence of a ducted heating or cooling system, and air
leakage through the floor (slab or conditioned basement, vs. other foundation types). In addition,
for houses built in 1990 or later, we assume a leakage value that is consistent with the "tight"
thermal shells typically seen in new construction (NL = 0.5).
3.1.8 Combined Boilers
For houses where the main heating equipment also provides the hot water, the DOE-2 simulation
engine calculates the hot water energy consumption. There are two different types of combined
boiler, direct and indirect. Direct combined boilers heat the water upon demand. Indirect
combined boilers have a storage tank, similar to a stand-alone hot water heater, which provides
hot water upon demand. The boiler maintains a steady temperature within the hot water storage
tank.
3.1.9 DOE-2 Post-processing
When the DOE-2.1E simulation program executes, it produces a large text output file containing
a series of user-specified output reports. We then post-process the raw DOE-2 output file to
extract only those results that will be presented to the HES user. These results are drawn from
the BEPS, SV-A, SS-A, and PV-A standard reports offered by DOE-2 (Winkelmann, et. al.
1993). Table 10 shows which values are drawn from these reports. The post-processor is
implemented in the Perl scripting language.

3.2 Water Heater Energy Consumption
Two main types of water heaters are modeled in the Home Energy Saver, separate
“stand-alone” units, and cases where the home’s heating system (boiler) provides the
domestic hot water supply. When the hot water is supplied by from a boiler, water
heating energy is calculated in the DOE-2 building simulation model. All other water
heaters are modeled according to the methodology outlined in this section of the report.
For homes with a clothes washer and/or dishwasher, the required gallons of hot water per
day is provided as an input to the hot water model (described below) by the clothes
washer and dishwasher models.
This module calculates energy consumption for heating water in three steps5. The first
step is to estimate average daily hot water use. This calculation is based on number and
ages of people living in the house, presence or absence of a dishwasher and a clothes
washer, the water heater temperature setting and tank size, and the local climate (Lutz, et
al, 1996).
Once the average daily hot water use has been estimated, a simple calculation is
performed to determine the daily energy use by the water heater. The calculation uses the
energy consumption characteristics of the water heater as determined by the DOE Energy
Factor test, ambient air and inlet water temperatures, and how much hot water is used on
an average day. The last step is to convert the daily energy use into annual consumption
of specific fuels.
3.2.1 Daily Hot Water Use
The Home Energy Saver web site uses the following equation6 to estimate average daily
hot water use in gallons per day (Lutz, et al. 1996). This equation was modified and
improved from Lutz et al's version by subtracting out the constant assumed hot water use
of clothes washers and dishwashers (the variables cloth and dish in Equation 4), and
adding two variables (cwGals and dwGals) that allow users to individually specify their
clothes washer and dishwasher hot water use (e.g. specifying loads washed at certain
temperatures). These two variables (cwGals and dwGals) are used to allocate the water
heater energy consumption into three portions; clothes washer, dishwasher and other. The
energy consumed by the water heater for the clothes washer and dishwasher portions is
reported with the Major Appliance energy in the final report. The calculation of hot water
use by clothes washers and dishwashers is described elsewhere in this report.

5

Methodology for water heating provided by combined space and water heating systems is described in the
companion report (Warner 2005).
6

The original development of the water heating analytical method was sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Energy, Office of Building Technology, State, and Community Programs as part of their appliance
standards analysis program (US DOE 2000c).

3.2.2 Daily Water Heater Energy Use

3.2.3 Ambient Air Temperature
The average annual air temperature around the water heater (Tam ) is derived from the
location of the water heater. If the water heater is located inside conditioned space, Tam is
set to the indoor air temperature (default value of 67.5 °F). A future improvement of the
modeling would be to have this default indoor air temperature correspond to thermostat
settings. If the water heater is located in the basement, Tam is set to the average of the
indoor and outdoor air temperatures (outdoor air temperature taken from the 30-yearaverage weather tape data for their location, see Section 4.1 Weather Data), otherwise Tam
is set to the average outdoor air temperature.
3.2.4 Standby Heat Loss Coefficient
To calculate the standby heat loss coefficient, we use the equation for heat loss from the
DOE Energy Factor test procedure for water heaters, (US DOE 1993) as shown in
Equation 6.

3.2.6 User Inputs to the Water Heater Model
At the simple inputs level of the Home Energy Saver, users are asked to select the fuel of
their water heater. The water heater characteristics (tank size, year purchased, etc.) are
defaulted based on choice of water heater fuel (Table XX). The values for recovery
efficiency and rated input for the water heater are derived from manufacturers' product
specifications (GAMA 1996) for typical models of each fuel type. Tank size was taken
from Table 4.4 of the Energy Data Sourcebook (Wenzel 1997).

3.2.7 Water Heater Energy Factor
The energy factor for the water heater is a derived shipment-weighted efficiency based on
the year the equipment was purchased (Table 12). This number is the average efficiency
for all units sold within a particular year weighted by the number of units in each
efficiency bin (GAMA 1996). For LPG-fired water heaters, we assumed the same energy
factor as for natural gas-fire units. For fuel oil-fired units, we assumed an energy factor
of 0.54 before 1990 and 0.59 after 1990 (Lutz, personal communication).

3.3 Major Appliances
Refrigerators, freezers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, dishwashers, stoves and ovens are
included in the “Major Appliance” category. Using the number and approximate age of major
appliances, the model estimates energy consumption, based on historic sales-weighted efficiency
data. This section contains the energy estimation methodology for each appliance. The estimated
consumption across equipment types is summed to arrive at the “Major Appliance” category
totals.
3.3.1 Refrigerator Energy Consumption
Refrigerators can have very different energy consumption depending on the year of manufacture
and features that affect energy use such as size, automatic defrost, or side-by-side design. To
estimate the energy consumption of these appliances, we use the calculation method described in
the Energy Data Sourcebook (Wenzel et al. 1997). Due to changes in technology and Federal
efficiency standards, refrigerators have become significantly more efficient over time. Because
most consumers do not know the Energy Factor of their refrigerator(s), we use a shipmentweighted energy factor based on the year the refrigerator was purchased (Table 14). This number
is the average energy factor for all units sold within a particular year weighted by the number of
units in each efficiency bin (AHAM 1996). Note that for purposes of this model, all refrigerators
are assumed to be combined refrigerator/freezers. We do not distinguish between
refrigerator/freezers located in conditioned space vs. those located in unconditioned space (e.g.
in the garage).

EC =

( 365 × AV )

Equation 8

EF

where
€

EC = Annual energy consumption (kWh/year)
AV = Adjusted volume (cubic feet)
EF = Energy Factor (kWh/cubic feet•year)
The refrigerator / freezer adjusted volume is intended to capture in a single parameter the
relatively high energy intensity of the refrigerator's frozen food compartment compared to the
fresh food compartment. Equation 9 is used to calculate adjusted volume (US DOE 1995), and
corresponds to the definition used in specification of federal minimum efficiency standards.
AV = size × ( frac + (1− frac ) ×1.63)
where

€

Equation 9

AV = Adjusted volume (cubic feet)
size = "Nominal" refrigerator/freezer volume (cubic feet)
frac = Fraction of refrigerator volume devoted to fresh-food storage (0 ≤ frac ≤ 1)
For side-by-side refrigerators, a fresh-food fraction of 0.6 is used, while all other configurations
use a fraction of 0.66. Note that this model does not account for refrigerator usage factors that
32

might vary among units, such as refrigerator and freezer temperature settings, door opening
frequency, food loading rates, and ambient temperatures. While these factors can have a large
impact on energy consumption, their effect has not been quantified in a way that could be
incorporated into a parametric model such as this.
3.3.1.1 User Inputs to the Refrigerator Model
At the simple inputs level, users can specify the number of refrigerators in their house, from zero
to three refrigerators. Each refrigerator specified has default characteristics (appliance type, size
and year) assigned depending on whether it is the first, second or third refrigerator in the house
(Table 8). In the detailed inputs calculation mode, users can alter these default characteristics.

Notes on Refrigerator Energy Factors:
1. Energy Factor has units of (kWh/cubic feet_year), where cubic feet is adjusted volume.
2. Source: (AHAM 1996) (AHAM 2003) - AHAM changed the reporting of refrigerator efficiencies after 1996. Annual
data is available for the “General” category. Data for the other refrigerator types for years subsequent to 1996 was

33

derived from the “General” refrigerator efficiency by scaling the efficiency for a particular type of refrigerator
proportional to the annual change in efficiencies in the “General” refrigerator category.
3. Data has been held at 2003 levels for subsequent years.

3.3.2 Freezer Energy Consumption
Freezer energy consumption is driven by many factors such as configuration (e.g. upright
freezers versus chest freezers) and technology (automatic vs. manual defrost capability).
Additionally, over the years, freezers have increased in size, causing the overall energy
consumption to increase. To estimate the energy consumption of these appliances, we use the
calculation method described in the Energy Data Sourcebook (Wenzel et al. 1997). Because
most consumers do not know the Energy Factor of their freezer(s), we use a shipment-weighted
energy factor based on the year the freezer was purchased (Table 16). This number is the average
energy factor for all units sold within a particular year weighted by the number of units in each
efficiency bin (AHAM 1996). Note that for purposes of this model, all freezers are assumed to be
stand-alone units (no fresh food compartment).

EC =

( 365 × AV )

Equation 10

EF

where
€

EC = Annual energy consumption (kWh/year)
AV = Adjusted volume (cubic feet)
EF = Energy Factor (kWh/cubic feet•year)
The adjusted volume is intended to capture in a single parameter the relatively high energy
intensity of the freezer’s frozen food compartments. Equation 11 is used to calculate adjusted
volume (US DOE 1995). This definition corresponds to the volume used in defining federal
minimum efficiency standards

AV = size ×1.73

Equation 11

where

€

AV = Adjusted volume (cubic feet)
Size = "Nominal" freezer volume (cubic feet)
Note that this model does not account for freezer usage factors that might vary between units,
such as temperature settings, door opening frequency, food loading rates, and ambient
temperatures. While these factors can have a large impact on energy consumption, their effect
has not been quantified in a way that could be incorporated into a parametric model such as this.
3.3.2.1 User Inputs to the Freezer Model
In the simple inputs level, users can specify the number of freezers in their house, from zero to
two units. Each freezer specified has default characteristics (appliance type, size and year)
assigned depending on whether it is the first or second freezer in the house (Table 17). In the
detailed inputs level, users can alter these default characteristics.

Notes on Freezer Energy Factors:
1. Energy Factor has units of (kWh/cubic feet_year), where cubic feet is adjusted volume.
2. Source: (AHAM 1996) (AHAM 2003) - AHAM changed the reporting of freezer efficiencies after 1996. Annual
data is available for the “General” category. Data for the other freezer types for years subsequent to 1996 was
derived from the “General” freezer efficiency by scaling the efficiency for a particular type of freezer proportional to
the annual change in efficiencies in the “General” freezer category.
3. Data has been held at 2003 levels for subsequent years.

3.3.3 Clothes Washer Energy Consumption
Although clothes washers consume energy for both mechanical activities and water heating
energy, the majority of the energy used is for water heating. Both machine energy and water
heating energy are directly dependent upon the number of loads washed. To estimate the energy
consumption of these appliances, Equations 12 and 13 use the calculation method described in
the Energy Data Sourcebook (Wenzel et al. 1997). Equation 14 calculates the water heating
portion of the total clothes washer energy.

EC = ME + WE
where
€

Equation 12

EC = Annual energy consumption in utility units
ME = Machine energy (kWh/year)
WE = Water heating energy attributable to clothes washer in utility units (returned
from water heater module)
When ME and WE are in different units (e.g. for non-electric water heaters) the energy
consumption for the clothes washer is calculated and stored separately for both fuels (e.g. 126
kWh and 23 therms).
3.3.3.1 Calculating Machine Energy
The machine energy is the electrical energy consumed by all the physical processes necessary to
run a load of laundry (e.g. agitation, spin cycle), and is calculated using Equation 13.

ME = LE × loads × 52
where
€

Equation 13

LE = load energy (kWh/load)
loads = clothes washer loads/week
52 is weeks/year
Machine energy for the average new clothes washer has not changed significantly over time, so
is assumed to be 0.27 kWh/load for the purposes of this model (DOE 1990, Page 3-22 table
3.17).
37

3.3.3.2 Calculating Water Heating Energy from Clothes Washer Use
The gallons of hot water used by the clothes washer is sent to the water heating model, which
calculates the energy consumed by the water heater to supply this amount of hot water to the
clothes washer. The daily usage (gallons) attributable to the clothes washer is calculated
according to Equation 14 (Koomey et al. 1994).

use
€

day

Equation 14

7

where
Useday = hot water use (gallons/day),
Loadsweek = number of loads per week,
Useload = hot water use for the average load (gallons/load)
7 = days per week

Energy consumed by the water heater in providing the necessary gallons of hot water for the
clothes washer is calculated by the water heating model (see Section 3.2) and incorporated into
Equation 12 to arrive at the total energy consumption for the clothes washer.
3.3.3.3 User Inputs to the Clothes Washer Model
At the simple inputs level in the Home Energy Saver, users only indicate whether or not a clothes
washer is present in their house. A default value for the clothes washer contribution to gallons of
hot water per day is set for those houses with clothes washer.
For the detailed inputs level, the number of clothes washer loads is assumed to be 380 loads/year
(US DOE 1990) and gallons of hot water per load depends on the temperature setting for the load
(Lutz et al. 1996). The default distribution of clothes washer temperature settings was based on
our judgment about typical usage patterns. Users can customize the number of loads washed and
the temperature settings to match the usage patterns in their house.

3.3.4 Clothes Dryer Energy Consumption
Clothes dryers consume energy for both mechanical activities and the drying process. The
majority of the energy used is for drying. Both machine energy and drying energy are directly
dependent upon the number of loads dried. To estimate the energy consumption of these
appliances, Equations 15 and 16 use the calculation method described by Wenzel et al. (1997).

38

EC f = ME + DE
where
€

Equation 15

ECf = Annual energy consumption for fuel f
ME = Machine energy (kWh/year)
DE = Drying energy in utility units (kWh/year or therms/year)
Energy consumption is portrayed in “utility units” for each fuel type; the electric utility is kWh,
natural gas utility unit is therms,
3.3.4.1 Machine Energy
The machine energy includes the energy consumed by all the mechanical and electrical processes
necessary to dry a load of laundry (e.g. drum rotation, timers etc.). Equation 16 is used to
calculate the machine energy.
Equation 16

ME = LE × loadsweek × 52
where
€

LE = load energy (kWh)
loadsweek = clothes dryer loads/week
52 = weeks/year
Machine energy for the average new clothes dryer has not changed significantly over time, so is
assumed to be 0.23 kWh/load for the purposes of this model (PG&E 1995).
3.3.4.2 Drying Energy
The energy consumed by the clothes dryer to produce heat necessary to dry the clothing is called
the drying energy. The drying energy is calculated according to Equation 17.

DE = loadsweek × useload × 52

€

Equation 17

where
Loadsweek = number of loads per week,
Useload = drying energy consumption per load (kWh or therms)
52 = weeks per year
The Home Energy Saver models electric and gas clothes dryers. Electric clothes dryers use 3.8
kWh and gas clothes dryers use 0.22 therms per load (PG&E 1995) for drying energy alone. This
energy consumption is in addition to the electricity required to operate the mechanical functions
of clothes drying (air circulation, drum rotation, timers and sensors, etc.) Our calculation process
does not distinguish between models that have moisture-sensor termination and those that do not.
3.3.4.3 User Inputs to the Clothes Dryer Model
The method of estimating clothes dryer energy depends on the user inputs available for each of
the different levels of user inputs. At the simple inputs level in the Home Energy Saver, no user
inputs are available concerning the clothes dryer. An electric clothes dryer is assigned to the
house as the default if users indicate that they have a clothes washer. The number of loads dried
is assumed to be equal to the number of loads of laundry washed.
39

For the detailed inputs level of the Home Energy Saver, the initial number of clothes dryer loads
is assumed to be 380 loads/year (US DOE 1990). Users can customize the number of loads dried
and select the primary fuel used for providing heat.
3.3.5 Dishwasher Energy Consumption
Dishwashers consume energy for both mechanical functions and water heating, with the majority
of the energy used for water heating. Both machine energy and water heating energy are directly
dependent upon the number of loads washed. To estimate the energy consumption of these
appliances, Equations 18 and 19 use the calculation method described by Wenzel et al. (1997).

EC = ME + WE
where

Equation 18

EC = Annual energy consumption in utility units
ME = Machine energy (kWh/year)
WE = Water heating energy in utility units (returned from water heater)

€

When ME and WE are in different units (e.g. for non-electric water heaters) the energy
consumption is reported and tracked in terms of more than one fuel (e.g. 126 kWh and 23
therms).
3.3.5.1 Machine Energy
The machine energy (Equation 19) includes the energy consumed by all the physical processes
necessary to run a load of dishes (e.g. pumps, heating element for drying cycle).

ME = LE × loads × 52
where

Equation 19

LE = load energy (kWh/load)
loads = dishwasher loads/week
52 = weeks/year

€

Machine energy for dishwashers is assumed to be 0.78 kWh/load for the purposes of this model
(US DOE 1990, Page 3-8 table 3.4).
3.3.5.2 Water Heating Energy
The quantity of hot water used by the dishwasher is sent to the water heating model, which
calculates the energy consumed to supply this amount of hot water to the dishwasher. The daily
hot water usage (gallons) attributable to the dishwasher is calculated according to Equation 20
(Koomey et al. 1994).

7

where
Useday = hot water use (gallons/day),
Loadsweek = number of loads per week,
Useload = hot water user per average load (gallons/load)
7 = days per week
40

Energy consumed by the water heater in providing the necessary amount of hot water for the
dishwasher is calculated by the water heating model (see Section 3.2) and incorporated into
Equation 18 to arrive at the total energy consumption for the dishwasher.
3.3.5.3 User Inputs to the Dishwasher Models
At the simple inputs level, users are unable to indicate whether or not a dishwasher is present in
their house. A dishwasher is assigned to the house if the user indicates that they own a clothes
washer. The default value for the daily gallons of hot water used by the dishwasher is set at the
time of dishwasher assignment.
For the detailed inputs level, the number of dishwasher loads is initially defaulted to 208
loads/year (US DOE 1990) with hot water usage of 11 gallons per load (Lutz et al. 1996). Users
can indicate the presence of a dishwasher and the number of loads washed per week.

3.3.6 Stove and Oven Energy Consumption
3.3.6.1 Stove Energy Consumption
In the Home Energy Saver, users are allowed to select between electric and gas stoves. Equation
21 describes the method used to calculate energy consumption by electric stoves. Equation 22 is
used with gas stoves.

EC = power × usageday × 365
where
€

Equation 21

EC = Annual energy consumption in kWh
power = energy consumption rate of stove (kWh/hour)
usageday = hours of use per day for all burners combined
365 = days per year

41

For electric ranges, the power consumed is assumed to be 1 kW for the purposes of this model
(PG&E 1995).

EC = (burner _ rate × usageday × 365) + pilotLight
where
€

Equation 22

EC = Annual energy consumption in therms
burner_rate = energy consumed by stove (therms/hour)
usageday = hours of use per day for all burners combined
365 is days per year
pilotLight = energy consumed by the pilot light (therms/year)
For gas ranges, the rate of energy use is assumed to be 0.09 therms/hour and pilot light
consumption is 17 therms/year (PG&E 1995). The default usage is 1 hour per day for both
electric and gas ranges.
3.3.6.2 Oven Energy Consumption
In the Home Energy Saver, users are allowed to select either an electric and gas oven. Equation
23 describes the method used to calculate energy consumption by electric ovens. Equation 24 is
used for gas ovens.
Equation 23

EC = power × usageweek × 52
where
€

EC = Annual energy consumption in kWh
power = energy consumed by oven (kWh/hour)
usageweek = hours of use per week for the oven
52 = weeks per year
For electric ovens, the power consumed is assumed to be 2.3 kWh/hour [or 2.3 kW] for the
purposes of this model (PG&E 1995). For gas ovens,
EC = (oven _ rate × usageweek × 52) + pilotLight
where

€

Equation 24

EC = Annual energy consumption in therms
oven_rate = energy consumed by stove (therms/hour)
usageweek = hours of use per week for all burners combined
52 is weeks per year
pilotLight = energy consumed by the pilot light (therms/year)
For gas ovens, the energy consumed is assumed to be 0.11 therms/hour and pilot light
consumption is 17 therms/year (PG&E 1995). The default usage for all ovens is assumed to be 2
hours per week, regardless of oven fuel.

3.4 Miscellaneous Equipment Energy Consumption
3.4.1 General Methodology
The model allows estimation of energy consumption for about seventy-five miscellaneous gas
and electric appliances, with default values based on data compiled over the years by LBNL
researchers. As with the other modules, default values can be over-ridden by the user to create a
more accurate characterization of the type and use of miscellaneous equipment in the home.
The miscellaneous appliance category contains a varied assortment of small and/or unusual
devices that could occur in a house, both electricity and gas. They are divided into several main
categories; Entertainment, Home Office, Miscellaneous Kitchen Appliances, Hot Tubs and Spas,
and Other Appliances. Energy for a particular piece of equipment is calculated according to the
following equation and summed across all miscellaneous equipment to get total miscellaneous
equipment energy consumption.
 ActivePower + StandbyPower 
× NumberMachines


1000
where

UEC =

€

Equation 25

UEC = annual energy consumed by the equipment (kWh)
ActivePower = ((P1 * P1Usage) + (P2 * P2Usage) +... + (Pn * PnUsage))
Pn = the energy consumed at various power levels (e.g. active use, on but idle etc.)
PnUsage = hours per year the equipment spends at this power rate.
StandbyPower = (8760 – Sum(all active Usages)) * StandbyRate
StandbyRate = energy consumed in standby mode
1000 converts WattHours to kWh.
NumberMachines = the quantity of this type of equipment in the house.
Typical energy consumption rates (both Active and Standby rates) for each piece of equipment
as well as standard patterns of usage are documented in Table 21. We selected the default set of
miscellaneous equipment types present in a house by examining the national saturation for each
type. Those devices for which Sanchez (1998) estimated a national saturation greater than 80%
were selected as part of the default set for all houses.
At the detailed inputs level, users can add and remove specific miscellaneous equipment types
from the default set, and specify the usage for each item. Table 21 lists the equipment types
present in the Home Energy Saver, showing the number of instances of this type of equipment
included in the default set for all houses, the energy consumption for various modes of activity,
both per unit time and annual totals, and the default usage assumption.

3.4.2 Well-pump energy calculation method
To calculate electrical energy for well pumps, we first calculate the energy needed to lift and
pressurize the water for delivery to the home, then divide by the overall efficiency of the pump
and motor system (Wateright 2003 and Greenberg 2005). The amount of energy required is a
function of the amount of water consumed by the household. We estimate annual indoor water
consumption using the following equation developed through a water end-use metering study
(Mayer et al. 1999).
Equation 26

AIC = (37.2 × occupants + 69.2) × 365
where:

AIC
Occupants
365

€

= Annual indoor water consumptions (gallons)
= total number of household occupants
= converts daily to annual consumption

Outdoor water consumption is estimated using data from Mayer et al. (1999).7 Because outdoor
water use depends heavily on house-specific usage patterns (e.g., landscaping or swimming
pools), we allow the user to select their outdoor water usage category, shown in Table 22.

The Mayer et al. study shows that indoor water use is relatively constant across the country, but outdoor water use
can vary by a factor of 20 or more between regions of the country. A possible future improvement to our water use
model would be to use the Mayer et al. study to estimate the relationship between climate and outdoor water use.

48

3960

= Annual water consumption (gallons per year) ÷ 525,600 (min/year)
= Unit conversion constant (feet•gallons/minute to horsepower)

To calculate total dynamic head (TDH), we use the following equation.
TDH = WellDepth + AdditionalHeight + pressurizationHead
where:

Equation 28

AdditionalHeight = Additional Height from well head to house
€

In practice, dynamic head would be a function of the depth to water and also include a term for
friction losses in the piping. To simplify our calculations and make it easier for the user to
describe their well system, we calculate dynamic head using the well depth (which will always
be greater than the depth to water) and ignore piping friction losses, under the assumption that
these two factors approximately cancel each other out. As a default, we assume that the average
residential well in the U.S. is 150 feet deep. Because pressurization head (the pressure at which
water is delivered to the piping in the house) is normally expressed using units of pressure (rather
than feet of head), we convert from pressure to head using a ratio of 2.31 feet of head per psi.
We assume 50 psi as a typical pressurization level for residential water systems supplied by
wells. Pressurization head is only included if the user indicates that the water pressure in their
house is provided by a water pump (versus gravity flow from storage).

The efficiency of pump and motor systems can vary widely depending on the type of pump and
motor, well configuration, and maintenance practices. Representative values for efficiency are
€ published, but it has been suggested that overall efficiencies between 0.15 and 0.60 are
not
typical. For modeling in HES, we assume a combined efficiency of 0.40 for residential well
pump/motor systems. For modeling best available pump/motor systems, we assume a combined
efficiency of 0.60.
Finally, we calculate annual energy consumption for well pumping using the following equation:
Equation 30

PumpingEnergy = EP × 8760
where:

3.5 Lighting Energy Consumption
Accurately estimating the energy consumption of lighting requires detailed information about the
technical specification of the fixture and the typical usage pattern for that fixture. Since not all
consumers are willing or able to provide that level of detail, the Home Energy Saver offers a
means to arrive at lighting consumption with minimal user input as well as a more complete
49

calculation model. Lighting fixtures are grouped according to the room in which they are located.
Equation 31 calculates the lighting energy consumption for all fixtures in a room. Lighting
consumption at the household level is simply the sum of energy consumed by all rooms.
n

EC =

∑ FE

Equation 31

i

i =1

where
EC = Annual lighting energy consumption by room (kWh/year)
FE = Fixture energy (kWh/year)
n = number of fixtures in room
The fixture energy represents the energy consumption of both the lamp and ballast components
of a light fixture. A fixture consists of all the lamps controlled on a single circuit. Fixture energy
is calculated using Equation 32.

 P + Pballast 
FE =  lamp
 ∗ usage ∗ 365
1000



€

Equation 31

where
Plamp = combined power for all lamps in fixture (Watts)
Pballast = total ballast power for fluorescent fixtures (Watts)
usage = fixture usage (hours/day)
365 is days per year
Note that ballast energy is only applicable for fluorescent tube fixtures. Any ballast energy for
compact fluorescent fixtures and halogen fixtures is included in the total lamp wattage for the
fixture, entered by the user. Ballast fixture power is given by

 NL 
Pballast = 130 ∗  
 2 

Equation 32

where
130 = Ballast power (Watts)
NL = number of lamps in fixture

€

[Note (NL/2) is rounded to next-higher integer value]

3.5.1 User Inputs to the Lighting Model
At the simple inputs level of modeling, users are asked to specify the number of fixtures per
room. The model then estimates the energy consumption per room, using default values based on
the appropriate room (Table 22), derived from a Tacoma Public Utilities Study (Jennings et al.
1997; Tribwell and Lerman 1996). Where these default data are used, all fixtures in the room are
considered to be identical. Alternatively, at the detailed inputs level of modeling, users are able

50

to enter lamp type, number of lamps/fixture, total fixture wattage and usage individually for
every fixture.

4. Default Energy Consumption and House Configuration
4.1 Average Energy Bills for Existing Houses
In order to provide users an initial estimate of energy savings potential in their house, we
estimated average energy bills by climate region from the sample of single-family housing units
(including manufactured homes) in the 1993 and 2001 RECS microdata (US DOE 1995a, US
DOE 2004). Users see this information immediately following entry of the zip code.
Energy bills by end-use are based on the end-use consumption estimates reported in the RECS
microdata. For each housing unit in the RECS sample, EIA reports the Census Division in which
that housing unit is located, as well as summary climate data (HDD and CDD) from the
geographically closest weather station.
In order to provide finer geographic disaggregation of the RECS data, we assign each of the
RECS housing units to one of 19 climate regions in the U.S. These climate regions were
originally developed by LBNL in a project for the Gas Research Institute (Ritschard et al. 1992)
and extended by Huang (Huang et al. 1999) and Apte (Apte 2004). The 19 climate zones are
described in Table 24. Using these climate-region assignments, within each climate region we
select those single-family housing units that have the most common heating and cooling
51

characteristics (heating fuel, water heating fuel, and presence of central air conditioner) for that
region.
The energy consumption for space heating, space cooling and water heating was determined
from this subset of housing units. Energy consumption for appliances was derived from the full
set of single-family housing units for each climate zone. The 2001 Residential Energy
Consumption Survey has not included data on lighting consumption since 1993, so the lighting
energy consumptions was taken from the 1993 RECS microdata (US DOE 1995a). The final
consumption values are shown in Appendix B, Default Energy Consumption

The climate zone assignment is determined by the Census division and heating and cooling
degree days (see Table 24) which are directly taken from the RECS micodata set. We determine
the most common characteristics through the default house analysis described in section 3.1.2.
These characteristics, and the number of RECS records meeting those criteria, are shown in
Table 25. We select only the houses that had the most common characteristics because we want
their average energy use to correspond to the default house characteristics for that region (to
provide internal consistency within the HES model).
The default energy consumption values from the RECS survey and the calculated energy
consumption values returned from the DOE 2.1E building simulation model are converted from
Mbtu to utility units (kWh, therm, etc.) for presentation to the user, using the following
equations.

4.2 Bill Savings in Typical Houses due to Energy Efficiency Upgrades
In order to provide users an idea of how much they could potentially save on their energy bills,
we have estimated technical savings potentials for typical houses in U.S. regions. These
estimates of savings potential are applied to the average existing energy bills by climate region,
as described in the previous section. Users see this information immediately following entry of
their zip code.
53

To estimate the potential savings, we select a single house from the 1990 RECS sample to
represent each census division. These houses are selected such that their utility bills are within
10% of the median value in each census division, and they have the heating and cooling
equipment most common in that census division. These selected houses are single-family
detached, with floor area ranging from 1100 to 2900 square feet. 1990 RECS utility bill data are
inflated to 1995 dollars using the Consumer Price Indices for electricity, piped gas, and fuel oil.
The characteristics of the selected houses are shown in Table 26.
We then estimate the utility bills for these houses, assuming that “best available” technology
were applied to the building shell and the equipment contained in that house (according to the
RECS survey). Best available technology is generally defined as the most efficient products on
the market. The savings estimates are based on several sources, including an LBL supply curves
analysis (Koomey et al. 1991) and unpublished updates to that analysis; the U.S. DOE Water
Heater standards analysis (U.S. DOE 2000c); a U.S. EPA analysis of space conditioning
efficiency improvements (L’Ecuyer et al. 1993); the Honeywell Thermostat Energy Savings
Estimator program (Honeywell 1994); Mark Modera (1998); and model directories from the Air
conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI 1995), Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association
(GAMA 1996), and the California Energy Commission (CEC 1998). The resulting savings
factors are shown in Table 27. For lighting, we assume 50% savings are achievable with a
combination of compact fluorescent lamps and outdoor lighting controls.
4.3 Carbon Emissions in Typical Houses
To estimate carbon emissions (as CO2) for the default house consumption (Typical House), we
use regional emission factors for electricity, and national emission factors for fuel-fired
appliances and equipment. For electricity, we developed regional emissions factors using total
emissions for fossil steam generation units (US DOE 1996), divided by net generation in each
census division.8 We then added 8% transmission and distribution losses. Finally, we scaled up
to account for the additional generation (roughly 2% nationally, but different regionally) that is
associated with combustion turbines and internal combustion engines. This approach assumes
that the combustion turbines and IC engines have, on average, the same emissions per kWh as
the other fossil-steam plants. The resulting values are annual averages for all electricity
generated within that region. The resulting emission factors are shown in Table 28.

8

This methodology accounts for zero-emission generation from hydro, nuclear, and renewables.

5 Bill calculation
There are two primary methods used to calculated the electric bills in the Home Energy Saver.
The default method utilizes state level energy prices and the tariff method, where users can select
an electricity tariff. For non-electric fuels, state level prices are used to calculate the annual bill
for that fuel.
5.1 Default Energy Prices
When users first enter the Home Energy Saver site, they are assigned default energy prices based
on the state in which their ZIP code is located. These default energy prices are the most recent
available state averages from either 2004 (for electricity and natural gas) or 2000 (for LPG and

5.2. Bill Calculations with Utility Block-Rate and Time-of-Use Tariffs
Consumer-oriented home energy calculators are only effective if they combine careful energy
analysis with energy cost information in a fashion that yields meaningful energy bills. Energy
tariffs (particularly those for electricity) are becoming increasingly complex, as they are
redesigned to encourage efficient use of energy at the margin and management of peak demand.
For example, the so-called “inverted block tariffs” present the user with increasingly high perunit electricity prices as consumption rises. “Time-of-Use” tariffs present the user with high
electricity prices at times when the utility system is likely to be facing peak demands (e.g.
weekday afternoons), and correspondingly low prices at off-peak times.
Most energy calculators utilize highly stylized prices (e.g. a flat cents-per-kilowatt-hour value),
which fail to capture the real-world conditions facing consumers. To address this void, the
Home Energy Saver site includes actual electricity tariffs, which may be selected by the user
instead of default electricity prices (described in Section 5.1 Default Energy Prices of this
report).
An analysis of a home on Sacramento provides an illustration of the value of more realistic
electricity price assumptions. Using an actual standard residential tariff from the local utility
(SMUD) results in an annual cooling electricity bill that is 22% lower than that predicted using
the statewide “default” average electricity price results. Conversely, using one of SMUD’s TOU
tariffs results in a bill that is 32% higher than the basic SMUD residential tariff. A subsequent
thermostat setback reduces the TOU bill by 18%. The results would be even more dramatic for
more extreme cooling climates.

The purpose of this module is to allow users to compare their utility bills under alternative tariff
scenarios, and to assess the potential bill savings from upgrades to the house or changes in
behavior.
For TOU tariffs in particular there are a special set of consumer behaviors that can currently be
modeled in HES to attain energy bill savings. Examples include:
•
•

Use of the programmable thermostat module to represent setbacks/setups, etc.
Technical measures to reduce air-conditioning demand (efficient equipment, roof color
58

•
•
•

change, etc)
Energy-efficiency measures in general (savings apportioned to end-use load shape)
Shifting to a different tariff
Shifting to a non-electric fuel

Underlying our method, utility tariff data are stored in the Tariff Analysis Project (TAP)
database (http://tariffs.lbl.gov/), and TAP is utilized to provide a web service for retrieving tariff
data and calculating utility bills. Currently, 177 residential and agricultural tariffs from 87
utilities in 42 states are available in the TAP database. As new tariffs are entered into the
database, they are automatically made accessible to HES users. We allow users to choose among
residential as well as agricultural tariffs (as some homes located on farms will utilize an
agricultural tariff).
With the exception of heating and cooling (which are currently modeled on an hourly basis), the
end-use load shapes are static. Thus, users cannot currently define an alternate load shape and
compute savings (e.g. to represent line-drying of clothes in summer), although this capability
may be added in the future.
5.2.1 Tariff Analysis Project Database
TAP was originally developed to facilitate the analysis of electricity prices for the US
Department of Energy's Appliance Efficiency Standards program. The tariff database and bill
calculation applications have been used in particular for the Distribution Transformers and
Commercial Unitary Air Conditioning Equipment rules.
The tariff analysis infrastructure consists of two primary components: a database containing the
rate structure information and related data fields, and a web interface allowing users to enter, edit
and view tariffs (http://tariffs.lbl.gov/). Starting from these components, a variety of applications
can be built, including bill calculator programs, batch data-processing scripts, and methods that
allow TAP to interface directly with other software.
One of the key innovations in the development of TAP is the design of a data-table format that is
flexible enough to accommodate the wide range of tariff structures encountered in practice. This
general data-table can be thought of as a "universal tariff template". TAP currently
accommodates the following rate design features for electricity tariffs:
•
•
•

Fixed, energy and demand charges
Block rates with constant or variable block sizes
Hours charges, seasonal rates, time-of use rates

In addition to the actual rates, understanding electricity pricing requires access to information
about the variety of tariffs offered by a utility, including service types, customer classes,
geographic constraints etc. This additional information is built into TAP, and allows the user of
the database to sample the set of tariffs according to a wide variety of criteria.

5.2.2 User Interface for Tariff Module
The HES user interface allows users to select a utility tariff, and to view the results of timedifferentiated electricity bill calculations.
5.2.2.1 Tariff Selection
To select an electric utility tariff, users must specify their electric distribution utility, and the
specific tariff they wish to analyze. The relationship between the input pages is shown in
Figure 11. When editing their utility rates (on the existing HES energy prices input page),
users can choose an option that starts the process of selecting a utility. Users may also make
this choice to use a utility tariff rather than the state average prices from the Key inputs page.
After selecting a ZIP code, users are asked to select their utility from a list of available
60

utilities. The next page presents a list of available tariffs, based on their choice of utility9.
After selecting a tariff, users return to continue refining their house description, or to initiate
the calculation process.
Throughout this process, users retain the option to end the tariff selection and return to the
default, annual-average rates, for cases where their utility is not available in the TAP
database or they simply change their mind (by returning to the energy price page and
selecting the radio button corresponding to the average electricity price).
Figure 11. Relevant HES Input Pages.

Since large utilities in California typically have multiple climate zones, a link to a map showing the climate
zones specific to the utility is given when available. The user can use this as a visual aid to refine their choice
among the tariffs available for their utility

61

5.2.2.2 Presentation of Results
For users who choose not to use the utility tariff option, the HES result pages presents
estimates of the house’s annual energy consumption by end-use. Those users who select a
utility tariff are provided with one or two additional results pages. Tariff analysis has added
the capability to calculate energy use and peak demand by end-use within each month, and
by Time-of-Use (TOU) period (for tariffs with TOU periods). As shown in Figure 6, when
the user views the main results page (showing annual energy use by end-use), they are
offered up to two additional choices from the blue buttons on the right side of the page. One
button opens a page displaying their estimated monthly bills by end-use; the second links to a
display of monthly bills by TOU period. The button linking to the monthly bills by TOU
period is only present for those tariffs that contain TOU periods. These pages are small popup windows that display in front of the main results window. The user can close the pop-up
window to return to the main results page.
5.2.3 Load Processing Algorithms
The core of the new HES functionality is a load processing “module” that translates annual
electricity consumptions for several end-uses, along with hourly outputs from the DOE-2
model, into monthly utility bills.
Load processing follows the general flow shown in Figure 12. Three types of servers (DOE2, Witango, and TAP) perform different parts of the load processing. To ensure consistency,
all load calculations are based on the year 2005 calendar. There are several distinct steps
necessary to transform annual electricity into monthly electricity bills. First, the non-HVAC
end-uses (appliances, lighting, etc.) with similar load shapes need to be combined then
allocated to an 8760-hour profile according to the appropriate load shape curve. Second, all
the 8760 hourly profiles for the house (including the hourly output from the DOE-2 heating
and cooling simulation engine) need to be aggregated to form the hourly profile for the
house. This profile is used to identify the monthly peak demand in each TOU bin as well as
the total monthly electricity consumption for each bin. These numbers are sent to TAP,
which returns the monthly electricity bills. Finally these bills need to be allocated back to the
individual appliances.

5.2.3.1 Annual Energy Consumption by End-Use
HES currently calculates annual energy consumption by end-use. In some cases,
consumption for multiple end-uses is aggregated to correspond to the end-uses available in
the load shape files provided by the California Energy Commission (CEC). This
correspondence is shown in Table 31.

5.2.3.2 Utility tariff data
Information for the user-selected tariff is provided by the TAP database. These data include
a unique tariff ID, and the information required to define the TOU periods for this tariff.
TOU tariffs are currently available for selected utilities around the United States. Due to the
complex geographic variation of some utilities in California, we developed a correspondence
table to help users select their utility tariff. Within California, we generated a table that
matches each 5-digit ZIP code to a specific utility service territory. This information is
available at: http://hes.lbl.gov/hes/CalUtilZips.doc
5.2.3.3 Non-HVAC hourly loads
For non-HVAC end-uses, we have pre-calculated a set of fixed (i.e. household independent)
end-use load shapes. The monthly allocation factor (Table 32), distributes annual energy
consumption across the calendar year. This monthly energy is transformed into two 24-hour
profiles using the load factors in the “2-day-type” loadshapes (for each month, average
weekday and average weekend), derived from the California Energy Commission forecasting
model (Appendix D). These load shape data were developed by Primen Consulting, a
64

subcontractor to ICF, under contract to CEC and have been processed to better integrate with
our data processing system, based on the same underlying load data. These load shapes are
not user-variable. Finally using the 2005 calendar year to specify the appropriate day type, an
8760-hour profile is created for each end use.

5.2.3.4 Heating and Cooling Hourly Loads
For each household, DOE-2 generates annual, 8760 hourly loads. These loads are reported
as several components (variables), which must be aggregated with the individual 8760 “nonHVAC” profiles to create the whole-house load. Some of the variables returned in the DOE2 reports apply to non-electric consumption, which are ignored for the calculations described
here.
5.2.3.5 TOU Mask
TOU tariffs assign each hour of each day to one of several periods. The current
implementation of TAP allows three periods: peak, off-peak and shoulder. Different tariffs
apply in each period.
A TOU mask is a set of three time series P(j), F(j) and S(j), j=1,8760.
By definition:
•

P(j) = 1 if hour j occurs during a peak period, P(j) = 0 otherwise.
65

•
•
•

F(j) = 1 if hour j occurs during an off-peak period, F(j) = 0 otherwise.
S(j) = 1 if hour j occurs during a shoulder period, S(j) = 0 otherwise.
P(j) + F(j) + S(j) = 1 for all j.

5.2.3.6 Load Aggregator
The core of the load processing is called the “Load Aggregator.” The load aggregator is a
Fortran program that runs on the web application server. Input data for the load aggregator
are stored in a run-specific temporary directory on the web application server. The
aggregator processing steps are shown in Figure 13. Two versions of the load aggregator are
used – one for TOU tariffs and another for standard (one-period) block-rate tariffs. An
auxiliary program provides the ability to dynamically generate TOU mask files, if a cached
version does not exist on the web application server. These mask files are generated from a
summary description of the tariff TOU periods, retrieved in real-time from the TAP server
using the SOAP protocol. SOAP (Simple Objects Access Protocol) is a process that provides
a way for applications running on different operating systems, with different technologies
and programming languages to communicate over the internet.
5.2.4 Input Values to TAP Utility Tariff Web Service
The output of the Load Aggregator are six numbers per calendar month, corresponding to the
total energy consumption and maximum demand in each of three time periods (peak, offpeak and shoulder). These values, along with identification of the chosen tariff, are sent to
the TAP bill calculator using a SOAP interface. Bills are calculated for the specific tariff
using the TAP bill calculation web service. This terminology is drawn from TOU tariffs, but
essentially the same method applies to standard tariffs with only one time period. For nonTOU tariffs all the energy is allocated to the “off-peak” bin. Time periods are defined
differently for each utility or in some cases for each tariff.
5.2.5 Bill Allocation to Specific End-Uses
Once the monthly electricity bill has been returned by the TAP web service, the monthly
average (not marginal) electricity bills by end-use are estimated by allocating the wholehouse monthly bill according to the relative monthly energy consumption for each end-use
using Equation 37.

66

Equation 37
 annualEnergy enduse * monthlyFactorenduse 
monthlyBillenduse = monthlyBillhouse * 

monthlyEnergy house



€

where
monthlyBillhouse = monthly bill returned by TAP service
monthlyFactorendues = monthly allocation factor derived from CEC loadshapes
annualEnergyendues = calculated energy for endues
monthlyEnergyhouse = monthly energy consumption returned by Load Aggregator

The resulting energy bills are used to show both the main results page, and additional report,
the monthly electricity bill report, and where appropriate the TOU report, where monthly
energy is displayed according to TOU bin.

Start the Aggregator
process

Import DOE-2 hourly
output files (the hourly
heating and cooling energy
consumption).

Import non-HVAC hourly
load shapes (derived from
California Energy
Commission load shape
data).
Create hourly consumption
profile for non-HVAC
appliances using hourly
load shapes
Combine all hourly
consumption files into a
single whole-house hourly
consumption profile.
The TOU mask file
indicates the “bin” (peak,
off-peak or shoulder) to
which each hour’s energy
consumption should be
allocated. If the tariff has
been used prior to this
calculation, a TOU hourly
will exist. If not, a mask is
generated using details
about the tariffs rate
structure.
After applying the TOU
mask, sum consumption in
each bin, and find the
maximum demand for the
house.
Results from the process
are returned for use in
calculating energy bill.

5.2.6 TAP Web Service
As noted above, the TAP database was created expressly for the purpose of storing utility tariff
data and calculating customer bills using data from these tariffs. The web service consists of
several functions, described below. These functions provide a client with enough data to
ultimately select and generate a monthly bill from any tariff in the TAP database. In order to
integrate this capability with the current HES web site, a web service interface was added to the
TAP database. This web service was implemented using the SOAP protocol.
Three groups of methods provide an interface with the TAP database. These include: Utility
Listing methods to allow the user to select his or her utility, Tariff Listing methods to further
select individual rate schedules, and Bill Calculation methods to determine utility bills based on
load data.
•
•
•

Utility Listing Methods – Accept state or ZIP code data, and return corresponding utility
names and codes
Tariff Listing Methods – Return a list of available tariffs for a particular utility
Bill Calculation Methods – Return consumption, demand and fixed charges from
consumption values generated by load processing module

A complete description of the SOAP schema and sample XML syntax can be found on-line at
http://hes.lbl.gov/hes/ImplementingTAP.pdf
5.2.6.1 OnTAP SOAP Server Interface Description
The OnTAP server accepts HTTP POST request in the form of well formed XML. These
requested are then directed to a specific public function of the OnTAP server. Specific functions
are declared in the request XML. Requests that are do not call a registered method will return the
WSDL description of the OnTAP class.
The OnTAP class’ public methods function as follows:
5.2.6.2 Utility Listing Methods
The following methods accept different inputs and return the same utility information output as a
XML document. This document is in the form of an array of string indexed arrays values (a 2
dimentional hash table).
•
•

doGetUtilityListByState: This accepts either a state’s full name or it’s 2 letter
abbreviation as a string.
doGetUtilityListByZip: This accepts a 5 digit zip code as an integer.
The XML returned contains the following values:

country: the country in which the utility operates

69

url: a link to the utility’s home page within TAP
eia_code: a unique code given to each utility in the United States by the E.I.A.

•
•

The key value returned for each utility is util_id, which can then used to run the tariff Listing
Methods.
5.2.6.3 Tariff Listing Methods
doGetUtilityTariffs: This accept one value: util_id as a string. The XML returned contains the
following values:
util_id: the internal TAP utility id
tariff_id: the internal TAP tariff id

minDemand: the minimum demand required by the customer to use the tariff as defined by the utility
maxDemand: the maximum demand allowed by the customer as defined by the utility
url: a link the to the tariff’s description page within TAP

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The key value returned for each utility is tariff_id, this is used to run the Bill Calculation
Methods.
5.2.6.4 Tariff Description Methods:
doGetTOU: Returns specific time-of-use information for the tariff $tariff_id. This accepts 1
value: tariff_id as an integer. It returns the Time-of-use data for tariff_id as follows: An array

DoGetYearlyBill: Is a wrapper for the doGetMonthlyBill method, it allows clients to sent a
complete year’s worth of inputs and return a complete year’s worth of bills. It accepts and
returns a 12-element array (one for each month) of doGetMonthlyBill inputs and outputs.

6. User Reports
6.1 Summary by End Use
The energy consumed by devices in each of the major end-use categories (Heating, Cooling,
Water Heating, Major Appliances, Small Appliances and Lighting) is summed by utility fuel
(Equation 38) and presented in three forms, as an annual bill, as energy consumed and as
pollution, in the form of carbon emissions (as CO2). Some end-uses have subdivisions that can
also be presented to the user. This information is shown when the user has changed the inputs in
the more detailed area. For example, if the user doesn’t customize the inputs for Lighting, only
one number, Annual Lighting Consumption will be shown. If the user gives general information
about the lighting in each room of their house, then the information shown will include
summaries of consumption at the room level. If a user goes further to specify actual fixtures in
the various rooms, the summary report for Lighting will show this fixture level, as well as
summed consumption by room and for the entire house. For a list of the devices in each end-use,
see the associated calculation section above.
n

UECe, f = ∑UECe,d , f

Equation 38

d =1

where

€

UEC = Energy consumption
d = Device
e = End-Use category (e.g heating, cooling etc.)
f = fuel in utility units (kWh, therms, gallonslpg, fuel oil)
To arrive at the final bill and pollution for each end use, the energy consumption for each fuel is
multiplied by the price and emissions factor for each fuel (Equations 39 and 40). These values
are summed across all fuels to get the end use bill and pollution.
n

bille = ∑ (UECe, f * p f )

Equation 39

f =1

71

€

where
UEC = Energy consumption
bill = annual bill (dollars)
e = End-Use category
p = energy price (dollars)
f = fuel in utility units (kWh, therms, gallonslpg, fuel oil)
n

pollution e = ∑ (UECe, f * c f )

Equation 40

f =1

where

€

UEC = Energy consumption
pollution = annual pollution emissions (lbs/C)
e = End-Use category
c = emissions factor (lbs/C)
f = fuel in utility units (kWh, therms, gallonslpg, fuel oil)
Total house values for energy, bill and pollution emissions are calculated by summing across end
uses. These resulting values are displayed to the user on the results pages shown in Technical
Specification of the Home Energy Saver website(Appendix D).
6.2 Carbon Emissions Factors
To arrive at the carbon emissions (as CO2) for energy consumed in the user’s house, we multiply
the annual energy for each fuel type by the emissions factor for the respective fuel. Table 34
contains the state level emissions factors for electricity while Table 33 has the emissions factors
for all other fuels. Electricity emissions factors are from U.S. EPA’s eGRID (Emissions &
Generation Resource Integrated Database), which contains emissions and resource mix data for
virtually every power plant and company that generates electricity in the United States (US EPA
2003). Natural gas and fuel oil emission factors are derived from U.S. DOE (1994), while the
LPG emission factor is from U.S. DOE (1996).

Notes:
1) Source: 2001 RECS - Averages are for single-family houses with the characteristics described in Table 24.
2) All energy consumption values are presented in Mbtu in the RECS dataset. Additionally the energy consumption output from the DOE 2.1E
building simulation model is also presented in Mbtu. Therefore we retain energy consumption as Mbtu, and convert to utility units (kWh,
therm, etc.) for presentation to the user, using the fuel-specific conversion factors found in Table 2 above.

DB/WB ratio is the ratio of dry-bulb to wet-bulb temperature at the cooling design-day conditions. It is intended as a relative indicator of a climate's humidity
during the cooling season. DB/WB ratio has been rounded to 2 decimal places for the purpose of this report.
11
For “duct factor” a value of 0 implies that heating is never needed, thus all duct losses are assigned to cooling. A value of 1 implies that cooling is never
needed, thus all duct losses are assigned to heating. Duct Factor has been rounded to 3 decimal places for the purpose of this report.

J.L. Warner
Environmental Energy Technologies Division
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The space-conditioning calculation section of the Home Energy Saver utilizes the building
energy simulation program DOE-2.1E. DOE-2 macros are employed extensively to calculate
input quantities, convert input quantities to the correct formats, and select the correct lines of
conditional DOE-2 code for each house simulation. Many components of the house description
can be varied, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Weather data;
Materials and constructions;
Doors;
Windows and skylights;
Foundations;
Attics and roofs;
House geometry;
House shading and buffering;
Internal loads;
Infiltration and natural ventilation;
HVAC systems; and
Ducts and pipes.

Inputs and outputs are passed to and from the DOE-2 code by the surrounding Web
programming.
In the future, EnergyPlus could be substituted for DOE-2 in the Home Energy Saver.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Home Energy Saver (LBNL 2003) is a World Wide Web site devoted to residential energy
analysis. The space-conditioning calculation section of the Home Energy Saver utilizes the
detailed hourly building energy simulation program DOE-2.1E (Birdsall et al. 1990). User inputs
for the energy-related characteristics of houses are collected and interpreted by Web
programming outside of DOE-2 (Pinckard et al. 2003). The prepared data are then passed to a
master DOE-2 Building Description Language (BDL) file (Winkelmann et al. 1993a) through
macro input variables (Winkelmann et al. 1993b). These and other macro variables internal to the
DOE-2 BDL file are used to calculate input quantities, convert input quantities to the correct
formats, and select the correct lines of conditional DOE-2 code for each house simulation. DOE2 output files are scanned by a second set of Web programming. The relevant output quantities
are captured, converted and compiled, and returned for display on the Web (Pinckard et al.
2003).
The following report sections describe inputs to the DOE-2 model, the details of the model, and
outputs from the DOE-2 model.

2. INPUTS TO THE DOE-2 MODEL
The DOE-2 macro input variables used in the Home Energy Saver are listed in Table 1, along
with their definitions and possible values. Conditional variables are those used only when other
variables have certain values.

3. THE DOE-2 MODEL
1.1. Weather Data
The 239 second-generation Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) weather data files (Marion and
Urban 1995), 42 first-generation Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather data files (NCDC
1981), and four California Climate Zone (CTZ) weather data files listed in Table 2 are accessible
in the Home Energy Saver. Corresponding location and climatic data (U.S. DOE 1998) are also
shown for comparison. Of these parameters, only the elevation is not automatically read from
weather data files by DOE-2; its value must be input explicitly, as listed in Table 1.

1.2. Materials and Constructions
Table 3 shows the physical properties of the construction materials that can be modeled in the
Home Energy Saver. The constructions comprised of these materials are listed in Table 4. Of
special note are interior partition walls, floors, and ceilings, which are modeled as halfconstructions and doubled in area to account correctly for radiative heat transfer between interior
surfaces.

2

Foundation constructions are handled directly in the DOE-2 BDL file. Two-dimensional
response factors for all other constructions are precalculated using a program called WALFERF.
These response factors are accessed and used by DOE-2 during simulation.
Surface roughnesses are used in the calculation of exterior air film coefficients in DOE-2. Table
5 shows the roughness codes (Winkelmann et al. 1993a) assumed for the exterior surfaces of the
constructions listed in Table 4.
Home Energy Saver users can specify the relative shades of exterior wall and roof surfaces. The
solar absorptance values assigned to these shades are shown in Table 6.

1.3. Doors
The nominal door types shown in Table 7 can be modeled in the Home Energy Saver. The Ufactors for these door types are drawn from ASHRAE (2001a). Alternatively, users can specify
customized door types by U-factor. These U-factors incorporate the exterior air film coefficient
at ASHRAE winter design conditions, while DOE-2 calculates variable exterior air film
coefficients according to the hourly weather data supplied. Therefore, the input door U-factors
are adjusted in DOE-2 macros according to the equation
U' = 1 / [(1 / U) – (1 / ho)]

(1)

where
U = design coefficient of heat transfer for a door (Btu/h·ft2·˚F)
ho = design exterior air film coefficient (Btu/h·ft2·˚F)
U' = coefficient of heat transfer for a door, excluding the effect of the exterior air film
coefficient (Btu/h·ft2·˚F)
In accordance with the most up-to-date calculation, the design exterior air film coefficient is
assigned a value of 5.112 Btu/h·ft2·˚F (Köhler 2002).
All doors specified in the Home Energy Saver are assumed to be 6.67 ft high and 3 ft wide.

1.4. Windows and Skylights
The nominal window and skylight types shown in Table 8 can be modeled in the Home Energy
Saver. As with the doors, their properties are drawn from ASHRAE (2001a). Users can also
specify customized window and skylight types by U-factor and solar heat gain coefficient
(SHGC). The U-factors are adjusted in DOE-2 macros in the same way as those of doors.
Because DOE-2 uses the shading coefficient (SC) as the measure of solar transmission through
fenestration, the SHGCs must be adjusted in DOE-2 macros according to the equation
SC = SHGC / 0.87

(2)

3

where
SHGC = whole-window or whole-skylight solar heat gain coefficient (dimensionless)
SC
= whole-window or whole-skylight shading coefficient (dimensionless)

1.5. Foundations
Slabs-on-grade, unconditioned and conditioned basements, and unvented and vented
crawlspaces, with and without insulation, can be modeled in the Home Energy Saver, as shown
in Table 10. Mixed or “averaged” foundation types cannot be simulated. Basements are assumed
to be 8 ft high, with 1 ft above grade for standard basements and 4 ft above grade for raised
basements in split-level houses. Crawlspaces are assumed to be 2.5 ft high and entirely above
grade.
Foundation heat transfer is simulated according to the method first devised by Huang et al.
(1988) and subsequently updated (Winkelmann 1998; Huang 2003). This method utilizes
effective foundation U-factors and fictitious foundation insulation layers to account for the
insulating value of the surrounding soil. The effective U-factors for the foundation types
modeled in the Home Energy Saver are included in Table 10.

1.6. Attics and Roofs
Unconditioned attics, conditioned attics, and cathedral or vaulted ceilings can be modeled in the
Home Energy Saver. Mixed or “averaged” attic/roof types cannot be simulated.
Roof apexes are always modeled parallel to the long axes of houses. Only one skylight type can
be modeled per roof.

1.7. House Geometry
Figure 1 indicates the necessary input dimensions for the eight types of house floor plans that can
be modeled in the Home Energy Saver. Figure 2 provides further insight into the variety of house
floor plans that can be treated.
Different wall, door, and window types can be modeled on different sides of houses. However,
there is no provision for modeling mixed types on the same side.
Door and window areas are divided proportionately among the wall elements on a given façade.
Window areas are also divided proportionately among the stories of a given façade. To avoid
incorrect shading of doors and windows by one another, doors are always anchored at the left
edges of walls, while windows are centered in walls. Window areas extend the full height of
stories, resulting in offsetting errors in shading by other surfaces and objects.

4

Interior wall areas are taken to be half as great as conditioned floor areas, exclusive of basements
and attics.

1.8. House Shading and Buffering
House shading by roof eaves, patios, carports, trellises, and similar overhangs can be modeled in
the Home Energy Saver. Different extensions can be specified on different sides of houses. All
overhangs are positioned at the roof line and assumed to run the lengths of the façades from
which they extend. They are assigned a uniform solar transmittance of 0.
DOE-2 test simulations were performed to ascertain the buffering effects of a garage on different
sides of a small, single-story house in different climates. Reductions in heating and cooling
energy consumption of 1.5% were consistently obtained. These effects should be even less for
larger houses. Because estimates of energy consumption from the Home Energy Saver are
intended to be conservative, garages are not considered in the model.
Shade trees and neighboring houses can be specified independently on different sides of houses
in the Home Energy Saver. Both are centered with respect to house façades. Trees are considered
to have 6-ft-tall trunks, assigned widths of 15 ft, and positioned 10 ft away from the houses they
shade. Neighboring houses are assigned the same widths as the houses they shade and positioned
20 ft away. Trees are assigned a solar transmittance of 0.70.

1.9. Internal Loads
House occupants are assumed to release sensible and latent loads of 230 Btu/h and 190 Btu/h,
respectively, in the Home Energy Saver. Internal gains from appliances and lights are passed to
DOE-2 from elsewhere in the Homer Energy Saver (Pinckard et al. 2003). Gains from appliances
are assumed to be 80% sensible and 20% latent. The typical load profiles plotted in Figure 3
apply to all 365 days of the simulated year.

1.10. Infiltration and Natural Ventilation
The Sherman-Grimsrud Method (Sherman 1980; Winkelmann et al. 1993b) is the specified
infiltration calculation option in the Home Energy Saver. Terrain parameters for suburban
environments are used. Fractional leakage areas (FLAs) for conditioned spaces above grade are
selected outside of DOE-2 according to user-specified house airtightness, vintage, and number of
stories (Pinckard et al. 2003) and passed to DOE-2 through a macro input variable. Alternatively,
users can specify measured or estimated air leakage rates. These leakage rates are converted to SI
units in a DOE-2 macro according to the simple relationship
Q50 = 0.0004719474 Q50ip

(3)

where

5

Q50ip = conditioned house envelope air leakage rate at 50 Pa (ft3/min)
Q50 = conditioned house envelope air leakage rate at 50 Pa (m3/s)
Conditioned house envelope air leakage rates are then found using the equation
Q4 = Q50 (4 / 50)0.65

(4)

where
Q50 = conditioned house envelope air leakage rate at 50 Pa (m3/s)
Q4 = conditioned house envelope air leakage rate at 4 Pa (m3/s)
Effective leakage areas (ELAs) of conditioned house envelopes are determined using the
equation
ELA = Q4 / [4 (2 / ρ)]0.5

(5)

where
Q4 = conditioned house envelope air leakage rate at 4 Pa (m3/s)
ρ
= air density (1.2 kg/m3)
ELA = effective leakage area of a conditioned house envelope (dimensionless)
Lastly, ELAs are converted to FLAs, including a unit conversion, using the relationship
(6)

FLA = (ELA / 0.09290304) / Af
where
ELA = effective leakage area of a conditioned house envelope (dimensionless)
Af = conditioned house floor area (ft2)
FLA = fractional leakage area of a conditioned house envelope (dimensionless)

For simplicity, basements are assumed to have no air exchange with the exterior. Unvented and
vented crawlspaces are assigned FLAs of 0.0015 and 0.0030, respectively. Unconditioned attics
are assigned FLAs of 0.00242 (Treidler 1993).
The opening of windows for natural ventilation is simulated whenever the exterior temperature
and humidity would result in a cooling effect. One quarter of the total user-specified window
area is assumed open, and a discharge coefficient of 0.6 is applied.

1.11. HVAC Systems
The HVAC system types shown in Table 11 can be modeled in the Home Energy Saver.
Performance curves for equipment efficiency as a function of part-load ratio are drawn from

6

Henderson et al. (1999). Curves for equipment capacity and efficiency as functions of outdoor
temperature are unpublished LBNL derivations based on commercially available equipment
performance data.
Hot water heating is simulated in DOE-2 for tankless and indirect boiler types. The results for
system types simulated as other system types are converted after capture in the Web
programming as necessary.
Window-mounted air conditioners that are controlled manually (i.e., by on-off switches rather
than thermostats), whole-house fans, portable fans, and portable electric resistance heaters are
treated separately from DOE-2 as appliances (Pinckard et al. 2003).

1.12. Ducts and Pipes
A simplified estimate of duct delivery efficiency, based on draft ASHRAE Standard 152P
(ASHRAE 2001b), is currently used in the Home Energy Saver. This single numerical value is a
weighted average corresponding to the pre-estimated annual heating and cooling loads for the
house to be modeled. The development of a DOE-2 function for the hourly calculation of duct
efficiency, based on the same Standard, is proposed.
Boiler pipes are simply treated. Uninsulated and insulated pipes are assigned delivery
efficiencies of 0.90 and 0.95, respectively.

4. OUTPUTS FROM THE DOE-2 MODEL
Table 12 provides a brief description of the outputs captured from DOE-2 simulations in the
Home Energy Saver. Hot water heating results are captured for tankless and indirect boilers.

5. FUTURE WORK
In the future, EnergyPlus could be substituted for DOE-2.1E as the space-conditioning energy
calculator in the Home Energy Saver. This conversion would allow the simulation of such
innovative HVAC systems as ground-source heat pumps, evaporative coolers, and hydronic
radiant heating and cooling systems.
