MEASURES OF ECONOMIC

IMPACTS OF WEATHER

EXTREMES

Getting Better but Far from What Is Needed

A Call for Action

BY STANLEY D. CHANGNON

Improved estimates of economic impacts from extremes exist, but the values are still

uncertain and adversely affect government and business decisions, an issue now recognized

as a national problem needing attention.

E veryone recognizes that weather extremes cause

financial losses, but the question is How much?
Measures of the financial impacts of weather ex-
tremes are largely qualitative estimates, a situation of-
ten misunderstood by atmospheric scientists and
many users of impact information. Ironically, the me-
teorological community frequently gets the blame for
the questionable impact values. Four recent national
assessments of hazards (Kunreuther 1998; Heinz Cen-
ter 2000; Mileti 1999; NRC 1999) have pointed to
problems of loss data, calling for better data needed
to effectively guide government policies and business

activities attempting to assess and address hazard risks.
Unfortunately, assessment of losses has long been
a very challenging problem for several reasons. Pri-
mary among these is the lack of systematic collection
of loss data (outside certain sectors of the insurance
industry). No one has been in charge of collecting and
quality controlling natural hazard impact data. Hence,
analysis of economic impacts of weather extremes has
lagged until recent years, when increasing pressures
for loss information led to a few assessments and new
estimates.

Losses from and costs of weather extremes are dif-
ficult to assess for numerous reasons.1 These include
the fact that 1) there is extremely limited data avail-
able for some major impacts; 2) most impact data are
difficult to access; and 3) available data are complex
and hard to evaluate without multidisciplinary skills.

1 Losses herein refer to market-based negative economic impacts
and include the costs associated with the aftermath of extreme
events.

The information available about direct losses and
most costs (beyond government expenditures) is
based on estimates developed by a wide variety of in-
dividuals and institutions using differing estimation
approaches and data sources.

UNCERTAINTIES IN ECONOMIC IMPACTS
DATA AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION.
Wise use of data about economic losses from weather
extremes requires understanding of the limitations in
the loss values and the factors affecting their quality.
In-depth studies of a few major catastrophic weather
events including the 1988 drought (Riebsame et al.
1991), Hurricane Andrew (Pielke 1995), and the
record 1993 Midwestern flood (Changnon 1996) have
helped reveal how difficult it is to obtain meaningful
estimates of actual losses.

Too often the people who must estimate losses are
neither experienced nor skilled in this work. The oft
complex assessment of the impacts of weather ex-
tremes requires adjustments for differences in data
sources and time-changing conditions such as the
growing population along the coasts. Such assess-
ments require skills in economic analysis and the ca-
pabilities to wisely interpret highly different forms of
data. Principal sources of loss data for weather events
include government agencies (at the city, state, and
federal levels), agricultural sources, insurance records,
private businesses, field studies of events by experts
in loss assessment, economic models, and
environmental monitoring systems.

such as earthquakes and wildfires create equally costly
losses but occur less frequently than weather disasters
(NRC 1999).

Environmental damage due to weather extremes
is another form of loss about which there is little
economic data. Recent reports on natural hazards
indicate that financial measures of environmental
damage are needed but lacking (NRC 1999; Mileti
1999).

Benefits, both to the economy and the environ-
ment, result from most weather disasters, but these
are seldom addressed or estimated. The focus of
weather disasters has always been on financial losses,
but some benefits also accrue. For example, the con-
struction industry often realizes major additional in-
come from the rebuilding efforts after a major disas-
ter, as done after the 1993 flood (Changnon 1996).

PROBLEMS FROM USING IMPACT DATA.
Major problems result from a lack of reliable data on
the economic impacts of extremes and a lack of
knowledge of the data limitations. Examples of cer-
tain problems are offered to illustrate these problems.
Since the 1980s, government relief for damages
from extremes has grown dramatically and by the
1990s had become recognized as a threat to balanc-
ing the federal budget. One reason behind this esca-
lation of presidential disaster declarations involved
politics (Downton and Pielke 2001). It has been noted

Another problem in loss assessment has
been the lack of accounting of the delayed,
indirect losses, as well as the economic ben-
efits some realize from extremes. Those
experiencing losses immediately seek aid,
and losses are quickly estimated. Govern-
ment relief actions are driven by political
pressures to get emergency relief payments
approved quickly. These near-event esti-
mates are often limited, in that they do not
consider losses occurring months and years
after the event.

Reasonably good data available on losses
include government and insurance pay-
ments for losses, but many losses are not
insured. Insured losses, considered the
most reliable measures of severe weather
losses (NRC 1999), are shown in Table 1
for weather extremes during 195097. Also
shown are federal payouts, which include
flood insurance, related to weather disas-
ters during 195397. Other natural hazards

that the issuance of a declaration and the amount of
funding awarded can depend on whether the gover-
nor of a state with damages is a member or nonmem-
ber of the political party of the President (Sylves
1998). Another reason for the growth in payments
was a lack of understanding of how impacts from ex-
treme events were increasing as a result of societal
shifts,  including  an  ever-growing  population
(Changnon et al. 2000).

Meanwhile, the Clinton administration promoted
disaster mitigation as a way to reduce the ever-
escalating relief costs. Considerable funding was de-
voted to improving mitigation activities (Hooke
2000). However, the lack of reasonably accurate data
on losses, both past and present, greatly limited as-
sessment of how economically effective the mitigation
expenditures had been (FEMA 1997). For example,
the federal government and California invested $165
million in flood mitigation activities after the costly
losses, roughly estimated at $2 billion (1998 dollars),
from the 1982/83 El Nino storms. Flooding from
storms during the comparable 1997/98 El Nino event
in California caused losses estimated at $1.1 billion
(Changnon 1999). Because the loss estimates are so
uncertain, the difference in losses of $0.9 billion can-
not be considered as a meaningful measure of the
value of the mitigative activities (NRC 1999).

Another major problem occurred in the insurance
industry. Insured losses from weather extremes be-
gan escalating in the late 1980s and reached all-time
highs during the 1990s, with $40 billion in insured
losses during 199194. The property insurance and
reinsurance industry experienced major financial
losses, nine firms became insolvent, and several firms
withdrew coverage from high-risk areas. The prop-
erty insurance industry had not effectively related
insurance exposure to potential weather perils be-
cause it had never established a common database that
recorded all losses for each weather peril. Hence, the
industry had no sound basis for setting rates. They
could not detect how shifting conditions, be they
weather related or due to the shifting vulnerability of
society, could impact them (van der Link et al. 1998).
Business as usual did not workthe industry learned
the hard way that the loss from an F4 tornado in 1994
was much greater than the loss from an F4 tornado
in 1950 or 1964.

Informed decision making has been hampered by
the lack of reasonably precise loss data. For example,
a recent major assessment of the nations natural
disasters could only offer crude estimates of losses
from weather extremes (Mileti 1999). For example,
20-year losses for tornadoes were cited as between

$5.8 and $58 billion. Such ill-defined loss informa-
tion limits informed decision making about the seri-
ousness of each weather hazard and related re-
search priorities.

Without a reasonably correct measure of todays
losses, it is difficult to assess the potential future losses.
Losses caused by many weather disasters (e.g., floods,
hail, winter storms, and hurricanes) have increased
over the past 1025 years, and most of the increase
has been found to be a result of societal factors includ-
ing growing population, demographic shifts, increas-
ing  wealth,  and  poorer  construction  practices
(Changnon et al. 2000). Future population growth
and societal trends will likely continue to increase the
loss potential, but adequate planning for a sustainable
future society is limited by the lack of a more solid
foundation of todays levels of loss (Anthes et al.
2001). This lack of knowledge about losses has also
affected the setting of priorities for atmospheric re-
search. Scientists have claimed that global warming
will lead to more weather extremes, but the scientific
community has not been able to offer convincing es-
timates of potential future losses that these extremes
would create.

THE GOOD NEWS. Given the data limitations,
questionable estimates, and resulting problems, what
good news relates to the issue of economic impacts
of extremes? Fortunately, the need to improve the
estimates of the losses (and benefits) from weather
extremes has become widely recognized during recent
years as a national problem (NRC 1999; Heinz Center
2000; Kunreuther 1998; Mileti 1999). The rapidly
growing federal disaster payments for weather losses
led the Clinton administration to focus attention on
the natural hazards problems facing the United States.
Another factor driving efforts to better define losses
was the governmental desire to measure the effective-
ness of its mitigation efforts (NRC 1999).

The financial impacts of three recent exception-
ally extreme events (1988 drought, Hurricane An-
drew 1992, and 1993 floods) underwent in-depth
studies, and these helped create new awareness of the
data problems. Other activities addressed the need for
better loss information. The U.S. Weather Research
Program identified the issue as being critical to its re-
search mission (Pielke and Kimpel 1997). The AMS
recognized the need to enhance and present infor-
mation about socioeconomic impacts among the at-
mospheric sciences and in 1996 established a special
committee to enhance presentations of impact infor-
mation. The AMS and the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research (UCAR) prepared two docu-

ments to provide guidance to the new (2001) admin-
istration and Congress about natural hazard issues
(Anthes et al. 2001). Both documents were based on
the seriousness of losses and costs resulting from
weather extremes.

Other good news relates to results of recent impact
studies that yielded updated and improved loss val-
ues. Some studies were motivated by concerns over
global warming and its potential effects on extremes,
whereas others were a result of the large weather
losses of the 1990s suffered by the insurance industry
and the government. Economists, geographers, and
political scientists joined with atmospheric scientists
to derive better estimates of economic impacts. For
example, extensive assessments of past hurricane and
flood loss data have undergone extensive assessments
with time-adjusted values derived (Pielke and Landsea
1998; Pielke 2000). A two-year study of weather ex-
tremes using insurance catastrophic data yielded
time- and risk-adjusted annual loss values for nine
extreme conditions in the nation (Changnon et al.
2001). Resulting values, as shown in Table 1, are more
definitive estimates of the nations losses than existed
before (NRC 1999).

RECOMMENDATIONS. It is widely recognized
now that the nation needs a concerted effort, and a
continuing program, to routinely assess and measure
the losses from weather extremes and other natural
hazards if it wants to adequately monitor the ever-
growing impacts and to have policies that wisely ad-
dress the issues. We are dealing with a moving tar-
get, a time-shifting vulnerability to weather extremes
and other hazards. I and others envision establishment
of a loss data collection center in a federal agency with
the power and resources necessary to gather data from
local, state, and federal agencies, from the insurance
industry, and from the uninsured. A multidisciplinary
staff with modeling capabilities is essential for improv-
ing loss estimates.

I would recommend establishing a lead agency for
loss assessments within the Department of Com-
merce. This brings the economists and their measures
of the economy together with the atmospheric scien-
tists of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration (NOAA). The agency would be respon-
sible  for  compiling  a  comprehensive  database
containing the losses of all natural hazards. The da-
tabase of dollars and human lives lost would form a
matrix of types of loss (crops, houses, human lives,
etc.) and would indicate who bore the loss (govern-
ment, insurers, individuals, etc.). Data would be gath-
ered for all hazards since weather and economic data

need to be collected routinely to establish a baseline
for assessing the impacts from extremes of varying
types and magnitudes. State and local agencies, in
addition to several federal agencies, need to be in-
volved since they access vast and unique impact in-
formation at the local and regional levels. Similarly,
the private insurance industry must be a cooperating
member of the data collection process, providing loss
measurement data to the lead agency. The industrys
incentives to cooperate rely on the ultimate access to
better overall loss data needed for improved risk as-
sessment, a goal of the Institute of Business and Home
Safety. Models of weather and losses will also be
needed for those circumstances in which certain fi-
nancial data cannot be accessed, such as damage to
uninsured homes. Determination of event losses and
benefits, both the direct and the indirect types using
many sources of data, should be done by persons
trained in numerous fields (weather, economics, en-
vironment, engineering, etc.). Training for such staff
could be accomplished at universities with strong
geography programs, a field of study that embraces
the physical and social sciences. A new program to
teach geographers about assessing the impacts of
weather/climate is an example of the direction needed
(Changnon 1998). It has been developed at Northern
Illinois University through National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) grants and private sector funding. Further
thoughts on the dimensions of such a national en-
deavor are available (see NRC 1999).
