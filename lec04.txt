LECTURE SCHEDULE 4
Computer Viruses, Worms and Vaccines
Computer Viruses
Computer virus is a small software program that is designed to spread from one computer to
another and to interfere with computer operation. A true virus is capable of self replication on a
machine. Virus may spread between files or disks.
•

There are estimated 30,000 computer viruses in existence.

•

Over 300 new ones are created each month.

•

First virus was created to show loopholes in software.

•

Today almost 87% of all viruses are spread through the internet.

Symptoms of Virus Attack
•

Computer runs slower than usual

•

Computer no longer boots up

•

Screen sometimes flicker

•

Speaker beeps periodically

•

System crashes for no reason

•

Files/directories sometimes disappear

•

Denial of Service (DoS)

Types Computer Viruses
•

•

•

•

Trojan Horse
•

Requires Windows to work

•

Once infected, runs in the background

Worm
•

Spread over network connection

•

Worms replicate

Macro
•

Specific to certain applications

•

Comprise a high percentage of the viruses

E-mail viruses

•

An e-mail virus travels as an attachment to e-mail messages, and usually
replicates itself by automatically mailing itself to dozens of people in the victim's
e-mail address book.

•

Some e-mail viruses don't even require a double-click -- they launch when you
view the infected message in the preview pane of your e-mail software.

Worms
A worm is a small piece of software that uses computer networks and security holes to replicate
itself. A copy of the worm scans the network for another machine that has a specific security
hole. It copies itself to the new machine using the security hole, and then starts replicating from
there, as well.
Worms use computer time and network bandwidth when they replicate. A worm called Code
Red made huge headlines in 2001. Experts predicted that this worm could clog the Internet so
effectively that things would completely grind to a halt.
A worm usually exploits some sort of security hole in a piece of software or the operating
system. For example, the Slammer worm (which caused mayhem in January 2003) exploited a
hole in Microsoft's SQL server.
Worms normally move around and infect other machines through computer networks. Using a
network, a worm can expand from a single copy incredibly quickly. The Code Red worm
replicated itself more than 250,000 times in approximately nine hours on July 19, 2001.
Protect computer against viruses:
•

Gain knowledge about viruses

•

Proper configurations

•

Run only necessary programs

•

Install Anti-virus software and update

Vaccines
Vaccines or Antivirus software is a computer program that detects, prevents, and takes action to
disarm or remove malicious software programs, such as viruses and worms. New viruses,
worms, and other threats are created by cyber terrorists and discovered every day. So updating

antivirus software is periodically mandatory. List of some top Anti Virus Programs which are
very useful to users:

Norton AntiVirus – Norton AntiVirus is the
most popular and secure virus scanner for
checking boot sector records at startup.
