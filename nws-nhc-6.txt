PREFACE 

 
 
This version of the Deadliest, Costliest, and Most Intense United States Tropical Cyclones extends 
the work of Blake et al. (2007) to include 2007-2010 and revised hurricane best track data from the 
period 1915-1930.  In addition, estimates from several storms are updated to correct errors as well as 
to include a more standardized methodology.  In most storms since 1995, estimates of flood damage 
from the National Flood Insurance Program are included in the total damage estimates for a more 
realistic total. The technical memorandum also continues the methodology of Pielke et al. (2008) to 
produce  an  estimate  of  the  monetary  loss  that  historical  hurricanes  could  exact on the current 
property-at-risk in the same location.

ABSTRACT   

 
This technical memorandum lists the deadliest tropical cyclones in the United States during 1851-
2010 and the costliest tropical cyclones in the United States during 1900-2010.  The compilation 
ranks damage, as expressed by monetary losses, in three ways: 1) contemporaneous estimates; 2) 
contemporaneous estimates adjusted by inflation to 2010 dollars; and 3) contemporaneous estimates 
adjusted for inflation and the growth of population and personal wealth (Pielke et al. 2008) to 2010 
dollars.  In addition, the most intense (i.e., major1 ) hurricanes to make landfall in the United States 
during the 160-year period are listed.  Also presented are some additional statistics on United States 
hurricanes and tropical cyclones in general. 
 
 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

 
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) receives numerous requests for statistical information on 
deaths and damage incurred during tropical cyclones (including tropical depression, tropical storms, 
subtropical storms and hurricanes) affecting the United States.  Information about tropical cyclone 
intensity  (i.e.,  maximum  1-min  surface wind) is also frequently of interest. Estimates of these 
measures vary in the literature and our goal is to present the best compilation of currently available 
estimates. In some instances, data in our lists represent revised estimates based on more complete 
information  received  since  earlier  publications  including  previous  versions  of  this  technical 
memorandum. There are also other frequently asked questions about hurricanes, and these questions 
are answered in Section 3.

2. BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS      

 
 
The Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS, Table 1) provides specific wind values for each 
hurricane category.  It is important to note that the original Saffir/Simpson hurricane scale category 
assignment of U.S. hurricanes was based on a combination of wind, central pressure and storm surge 
values (Hebert and Taylor 1975).  Since about 1990, however, the NHC has assigned the SSHWS 
category on the basis of the maximum one-minute sustained wind speed only.  Thus, there is an 
inconsistency in the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) that will be rectified as the Atlantic 
best-track reanalysis project is completed (Landsea et al. 2004).  Currently, the SSHWS category 
assignment is based on wind speed from 1851-1930 and 1990-2010 and on a combination of wind, 
pressure and storm surge from 1931-1989.  Heavy rainfall associated with a hurricane was not one of 
the criteria used in the categorization.  
 
The process of assigning a SSHWS category number to a hurricane in any location is subjective, 
and it is made on a county-by-county basis.  In this study, we use criteria for direct hit as 
described in the work by Jarrell et al. (1992).   
 

Direct Hit - Using "R" as the radius of maximum winds in a hurricane (the distance in miles 
from the storm's center to the circle of maximum winds around the center), all or parts of 
coastal counties falling within approximately 2R to the right and R to the left of a storm's 
track were considered to have received a direct hit.  (This assumes an observer at sea looking 
toward the shore.  If there was no landfall, the closest point of approach was used in place of 
the landfall point).  On average, this direct hit zone extended about 50 miles along the 
coastline (corresponding to an average value of R of 15 miles). Of course, some hurricanes 
were smaller than this and some, particularly at higher latitudes, were much larger.  Cases 
were judged individually, and many borderline situations had to be resolved.   

 
In this document, the term strike is designated to mean one of two things:  
 

1)  During  the  years  1851-1930  and  1990  to  2010,  a  hurricane  strike  is  defined  to  be  the 
occurrence of sustained hurricane force winds on the coastline or inland.  This does not 
require the center to make landfall in the area of hurricane-force winds.  Such an event 
occurred with Hurricane Ophelia in 2005, which remained offshore of the North Carolina 
coast but still brought sustained hurricane-force winds to the coastline. 

2)  During the years 1931 to 1989, a hurricane strike is defined as one whose center passes 
within the direct hit definition area provided above.  The best-track reanalysis project is 
working to change the definition to be strictly determined by the winds, but for now the 
regional effects catalogued by HURDAT are in a transition period that could last several 
more years. 

 
Statistics on tropical storm and hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean (which includes the 
Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea) can also be found in McAdie et al. (2009).  A stratification of 
hurricanes by SSHWS category which have affected coastal counties of the Gulf of Mexico and 
North Atlantic Ocean can be found in Jarrell et al. (1992) and also at the NOAA Coastal Services 
Center  (http://csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/) updated through 2010. Additional information about the 
 
 

3 

impact of hurricanes can be found in annual hurricane season summary articles in Monthly Weather 
Review, Storm Data and Mariners Weather Log.   
 
A continuing feature for this update is the inclusion of estimated inland wind impacts of some 
hurricanes.  These cyclones are indicated with an I before the state abbreviation in the 
HURDAT database and this symbol is exclusively used for hurricane wind impacts that are felt 
in a state, but not at the coastal areas (see Appendix A). One example of this occurrence is 
Hurricane Dennis (2005).  After landfall, Dennis produced category one hurricane winds over 
inland areas of Alabama, but these effects were not felt along the coast of Alabama.  Thus an I 
is added in front of the state designation, to be IAL 1.  If a hurricane primarily impacts the coastal 
areas of a state, inland effects are not listed separately. The goal of this listing is to indicate only 
the most significant impact to that state. Because of the geography of Florida, any effects in the 
state are considered coastal. 
 
It is important to note the changing derivation of damage estimates at NHC.  Death and damage 
totals for the period 1915-1965 were taken from Gentry (1966), which gave figures adjusted to 
1957-59 costs as a base for the period 1915-1965.  From 1966-1994, damages were obtained 
from Monthly Weather Review.  However, the Monthly Weather Review estimates represented a 
highly variable and subjective combination of losses from the American Red Cross, the U.S. 
Office of Emergency Preparedness, insurance companies and press reports.  After 1994, except 
for a few cases involving significant flooding, most of the Monthly Weather Review damage 
estimates were determined by doubling the private insurance losses reported by the Property 
Claim Service or the American Insurance Institute.  These insurance loss figures do not include 
flood losses from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which have only been included 
since Hurricane Ike of 2008. 
 
A standardized methodology for calculating total losses, including NFIP figures, has been 
developed and utilized for each storm that made landfall after 1994 in the mainland United 
States.  In this document, for almost all storms that occurred beginning in the 1995 season, the 
final NHC damage estimate is the sum of double the insured loss estimate, plus an adjusted 
estimate of flood losses from NFIP. Because of the highly variable rates of flood insurance along 
the coast, it is improper to simply double the flood losses for an estimate of total flood damage.  
Instead, the county NFIP losses are multiplied by the estimated county penetration rates for the 
highest flood risk area using the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) special flood 
hazard area (SFHA, e.g. the 100-year base flood plain) for a more accurate measure.  This 
estimate should still be conservative for total flood damages because most homeowners policies 
are capped at $250,000 and areas outside of the SFHA can be affecting in a significant flood.  
Note that this calculation adds a significant amount of damage to previous estimates after 1994 
(e.g. Allison 2001 rises from $5 billion to $9 billion).  See Appendix B for other significant 
changes to several U.S. tropical cyclones private insurance damages estimates.

3. FAQ 
Part I  

 
 
The remainder of this memorandum provides answers to some of the most frequently asked 
questions about the characteristics and effects of the tropical cyclones in the United States from 
1851-2010.  Part I deals with the deadliest, costliest and most intense United States tropical 
cyclones.   
 
(1) What have been the deadliest tropical cyclones in the United States?  Table 2 lists the 
tropical cyclones that have caused at least 25 deaths on the U.S. mainland during the period 
1851-2010.  There have been no additions to this list since 2005.  The Galveston Hurricane of 
1900 was responsible for at least 8000 deaths and remains first on the list. A revision was made 
to Hurricane Katrina of 2005 to remove confirmed indirect deaths from the original total of 1500 
based on recent research (Brunkard et al. 2008, Jonkman et al. 2009).  The latest NHC estimate is 
that Katrina was directly responsible for about 1200 deaths and it remains the third deadliest 
hurricane to strike the United States. Figure 1 shows the paths of these deadly cyclones.  
Although these systems are spread out over most of the coast, there is a clustering of tracks on 
the coasts of Texas, southeastern Louisiana, south Florida, North Carolina and New England.   
 
(2) What have been the costliest tropical cyclones in the United States?  Table 3a lists the 30 
costliest tropical cyclones to strike the U.S. mainland from 1900-2010.  No monetary estimates 
are available before 1900.  Amounts in the tables are not adjusted for inflation and include 
adjusted NFIP flood damage amounts beginning in 1995.  Hurricane Ike of 2008 was the second- 
costliest hurricane on record and was the most significant addition to the list. Hurricane Katrina 
of 2005 was responsible for at least $108 billion of property damage and is by far the costliest 
hurricane to ever strike the United States.  It is of note that the last ten hurricane seasons have 
produced 14 out of the 30 costliest systems to affect the United States.  Figure 2 displays the 
near- landfall portion of these tropical cyclone tracks and shows concentrations of costly 
hurricanes along the central Gulf Coast, south Florida and the Carolinas.  Table 3b re-orders 
Table 3a and the historical database after adjusting to 2010 dollars2, which adds several other 
hurricanes.  Since 2000, even after accounting for inflation, the United States has experienced 11 
out of the 30 costliest tropical cyclones. Hawaiian, Puerto Rican and Virgin Island tropical 
cyclones since 1900 are listed as addenda to Tables 3a and 3b.   Table 3b also lists the 30 
costliest hurricanes (see also Figure 3) assuming that a hurricane having the same track, size and 
intensity as noted in the historical record would strike the area with todays population and 
property-at-risk.  After this normalization to todays societal vulnerability, the last decade still 
accounts for eight of the top 30 tropical cyclones.   
 
(3) What have been the most intense hurricanes to strike the United States?  Table 4 lists the 
most intense major hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland during the period 1851-2010.  In this 
study, the major hurricanes have been ranked by estimating central pressure at time of landfall. 
We have used central pressure as a proxy for intensity due to the uncertainties in maximum wind 
speed estimates for many historical hurricanes.  Hurricane Katrina had the third lowest pressure 
ever noted at landfall, behind the 1935 Florida Keys hurricane and Hurricane Camille in 1969. 
2   Adjusted to 2010 dollars on the basis of U.S. Department of Commerce Implicit Price Deflator for Construction.     Available index numbers are 
rounded to the nearest tenth.  This rounding can result in slight changes in the adjusted damage of one hurricane relative to another.

Although Hurricane Ike had a landfall pressure of 950 mb, it was not a major hurricane at 
landfall.  Moreover, no major hurricanes hit the United States during the past 5 years.  Figure 4 
shows where these major hurricanes struck the coast.  Puerto Rican and Virgin Island hurricanes 
are listed as addenda to Table 4.   
 
A look at the lists of deadliest and costliest hurricanes reveals several striking facts:  (1) Fourteen 
out of the fifteen deadliest hurricanes were of category 3 or higher intensity.  (2) Large death 
totals were primarily a result of the 10 feet or greater rise of the ocean (storm surge) associated 
with many of these major hurricanes. Katrina of 2005 typifies this point. (3) A large portion of 
the damage in some of costliest tropical cyclones (Table 3a) resulted from inland floods caused 
by torrential rain (e.g. Agnes of 1972).  (4) One-third of the 30 deadliest hurricanes were category 
4 or higher. (5) Only seven of the deadliest hurricanes occurred during the past 25 years, while 
over two-thirds of the costliest hurricanes occurred during the same period.  
 
Katrina provided a grim reminder of what can happen in a hurricane landfall.  Sociologists 
estimate, however, that people only remember the worst effects of a hurricane for about seven 
years (B. Morrow, personal communication). One of the greatest concerns of the National 
Weather Service's (NWS) hurricane preparedness officials is that people will think that no more 
large loss of life will occur in a hurricane because of our advanced technology and improved 
hurricane forecasts.  Bill Read, current Director of NHC, as well as former NHC Directors, have 
repeatedly emphasized the great danger of a catastrophic loss of life in a future hurricane if 
proper preparedness plans for vulnerable areas are not formulated, maintained and executed. 
 
The study by Jarrell et al. (1992) used 1990 census data to show that 85% of U.S. coastal 
residents from Texas to Maine had never experienced a direct hit by a major hurricane.  This risk 
is higher today as an estimated 50 million residents have moved to coastal sections during the 
past twenty-five years.  The experience gained through the landfall of 7 major hurricanes during 
the past 7 years has not lessened an ever-growing concern brought by the continued increase in 
coastal populations.   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Continued coastal growth and inflation will almost certainly result in every future major 
landfalling hurricane (and even weaker hurricanes and tropical storms) replacing one of the 
current costliest hurricanes.  For example, all three of the U.S. hurricane landfalls of 2008 made 
the top 30 list, despite none of them being major hurricanes at landfall.  If warnings are heeded 
and preparedness plans developed, the death toll can be minimized. However, large property 
losses are inevitable in the absence of a significant change of attitude, policy, or laws governing 
building practices (codes and location) near the ocean.

Table 5.  Hurricane strikes on the mainland United 

States (1851-2010).

Major hurricanes are categories 3,4 & 5.

Table 5 summarizes the hurricane strikes on the U. S. 
mainland since 1851.  About two major hurricanes 
every three years made landfall somewhere along the 
Gulf or Atlantic coast. (All categories combined 
average about five hurricanes every three years.) Note 
that not all areas of the U.S. were settled before 1900 
and there could be substantial gaps in landfall data 
coverage, especially in south Florida (Landsea et al. 
2004). 
 
Table 6, which lists hurricanes by decades since 1851, shows that during the 40-year period 
1961-2000 both the number and intensity of landfalling U.S. hurricanes decreased sharply.  
Based on 1901-1960 statistics, the expected number of hurricanes and major hurricanes during 
the period 1961-2000 would have been 77 and 30, respectively.  However, only 55 (or 71%) of 
the expected number of hurricanes struck the U.S. with only 19 major hurricanes (or 63% of that 
expected number).  However, landfall activity during the 2000s has picked up significantly, and 
is now near the frequency seen in the very active 1950s.  These increased landfalls are very 
different than the late 1990s, which showed average landfall frequencies despite having 
generally active seasons. 
 
Despite the increase in overall 
activity, the United States hasnt 
seen a significant resurgence of 
exceptionally strong hurricane 
landfalls. During the past 40 
years, the United States has 
experienced three Category 4 or 
stronger hurricanes:  Charley in 
2004, Andrew of 1992 and Hugo 
of 1989.  However, on average, a 
category 4 or stronger hurricane 
strikes the United States about 
once every 8 years.  We have seen 
fewer exceptionally strong 
hurricanes than an expected 40-
year average of about 5. Fewer 
hurricanes, however, do not 
necessarily mean a lesser threat of 
disaster. The most intense U.S. 
hurricane in 1935, and the second 
costliest, Andrew in 1992, 
occurred in years which had much 
below-average hurricane activity.

Part II 

 
This section answers other frequently asked questions about tropical storm and hurricane activity. 
  
(1)  What is the average number of tropical cyclones per year?   Table 7 gives the average 
number of tropical cyclones which reached tropical storm, hurricane and major hurricane strength 
for selected time periods. The 30-year period from 1981-2010 is believed to provide the best 
current climatology because it samples equally the active and inactive phases of a multi-decadal 
cycle in Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency using modern increased monitoring capabilities.  
Using this period, the climatological mean numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major 
hurricanes are twelve, six, and three, respectively. 
 

Table 7.  Average number of tropical cyclones* which reached storm, hurricane and major 

hurricane status.  Updated from Blake et al. (2007).

(2)  What year(s) have had the most/least hurricanes and landfalls?   
Table 8a shows the years of maximum and minimum tropical storm, hurricane, and major 
hurricane activity for the Atlantic hurricane basin.  Tropical cyclone activity prior to the satellite 
surveillance era is uncertain and likely to be an underestimate of actual activity. The 2005 season 
set many records far above the previous records for the most number of tropical storms and 
hurricanes, but 1950 still holds the record for the maximum number of major hurricanes. 2010 
had the third-most number of tropical storms and the second-most number of hurricanes. The 
two-year period of 2004-2005 was the most active ever seen in the Atlantic basin, setting records 
for the largest number of tropical storms and hurricanes in a two-year period and tying the record 
(13) for the largest number of major hurricanes set in 1950-1951.  It is also of note that 10 out of 
the last 16 years have experienced 14 or more tropical storms.

Table 8b lists the years of maximum U.S. hurricane and major hurricane strikes.  The 2005 
season set the record for the most U.S. major hurricane strikes since 1851 and tied the record for 
second-most hurricane strikes.  2004-2005 produced 12 U.S. hurricane strikes, eclipsing the 
previous record of 11 hurricane strikes in consecutive years, set in 1886-1887.  The 2009 and 
2010 seasons did not see a hurricane strike, and the only other times that the United States has 
gone as long as two years without a hurricane strike are 1862-64, 1930-31, 1981-82 and 2000-01. 
Note that there is considerable uncertainty before about 1900 because significant areas of the 
Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts were unpopulated.  Multiple U.S. major hurricane strikes in 
one year are somewhat rare, occurring on average about once every decade.

(3) When were the earliest and latest hurricane formations?  The Atlantic hurricane season is 
defined as June 1 through November 30.  The earliest observed hurricane formation occurred on 
March 7, 1908, while the latest observed formation was on December 31, 1954 (the second 
Alice of that year which persisted as a hurricane until January 5, 1955).  Zeta of 2005 was the 
second latest tropical cyclone to form, just six hours ahead of Alice in 1954. The earliest 
hurricane to strike the United States was Alma which struck northwest Florida on June 9, 1966.  
Hurricane Kate was the latest hurricane to strike the United States on November 21, 1985.  Note 
that a previously analyzed hurricane landfall on December 1, 1925 near Tampa, Florida has been 
recently re-analyzed to be a tropical storm landfall. 
 
 
(4) What were the longest-lived and shortest-lived hurricanes?   The third tropical cyclone of 
1899 holds the record for most days as a tropical storm (28) and as major hurricane (11.5), while 
Ginger in 1971 holds the record for the most days as a hurricane (20).  There have been many 
tropical cyclones that remained at hurricane intensity for 12 hours or less, the most recent of 
which was Karen of 2007. 
 
 
(5) What was the hurricane with the lowest central pressure in the Atlantic basin?     Wilma 
in 2005 had an estimated pressure of 882 millibars in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, breaking 
the previous record of 888 millibars held by Gilbert of 1988.  The 1935 Labor Day hurricane in 
the Florida Keys had the lowest central pressure in any hurricane to strike the United States since 
1851, with a pressure of 892 millibars. 
 
 
(6) What were the strongest and weakest hurricanes in terms of maximum sustained 
winds?   Different methodologies have been used to arrive at wind estimates in HURDAT during 
different time periods.  The Atlantic re-analysis project is undergoing an extensive overhaul of 
the best track database at this time to standardize the methodology.  Right now, this reanalysis of 
wind estimates is only available for the years 1851-1930.  Substantial changes to the wind record 
are expected during the period 1931-1989.  After this project is complete, NHC will publish a list 
of the strongest hurricanes in terms of winds.  Numerous hurricanes have made landfall in the 
United States with minimal (75 mph) hurricane force winds, most recently Cindy of 2005.    
 
 
(7) What was the most number of hurricanes occurring in the Atlantic basin at the same 
time? Four hurricanes occurred simultaneously on two occasions.  The first occasion was August 
22, 1893, and one of these hurricanes eventually killed 1,000-2,000 people in Georgia and South 
Carolina.  The second occurrence was from September 25-27, 1998, when Georges, Ivan, Jeanne 
and Karl all existed at hurricane strength.   In 1971 from September 10 to 12, there were five 
tropical cyclones at the same time; however, while most of these ultimately achieved hurricane 
intensity, there were never more than two hurricanes at any one time.

(8) How many hurricanes have there been in each month?   Table 9a, updated from Blake et 
al. (2007), shows the total and average number of tropical storms, hurricanes and major 
hurricanes by month for the period 1851-2010.  This table also has the monthly total and average 
number of hurricanes to strike the United States since 1851. Table 9b displays the same statistics 
from 1981-2010 corresponding to the 30-year climatological averages.  Table 9c shows the 
record activity in the basin by month of formation.

(9) How many hurricane strikes of various categories have affected each state?  Table 10, 
updated from Blake et al. (2007), shows the hurricane strikes affecting the United States and 
individual states.  Note the inland designation is only used for those hurricanes that exclusively 
struck inland portions of a state (not at the coast).  The table shows that, on average, close to 
seven hurricanes every four years (~1.8 per year) strike the United States, while about two major 
hurricanes strike the U.S. coast every three years.  Other noteworthy facts, updated from Blake et 
al. (2007), are:  1.) Forty percent of all U.S. hurricanes and major hurricanes were in Florida;  2.) 
Sixty percent of category 4 or higher hurricane strikes have occurred in either Florida or Texas;  
3.) Sixty percent of all hurricanes affecting Georgia actually come from the south or southwest 
across northwestern Florida, though these hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico are much weaker 
by the time they reach Georgia than those that come from the Atlantic Ocean.   It should be noted 
that both Florida and Texas have extensive coastlines, which one reason for the high number of 
occurrences.

(10) When are major hurricanes likely to strike a given area? Table 11 shows the incidence 
of major hurricanes by month for the U.S. mainland and for individual states. September has 
about as many major hurricane landfalls as October and August combined.  The northern Gulf 
Coast from Texas to northwest Florida is the prime target for pre-August major hurricanes.  The 
threat of major hurricanes increases from west to east as the season progresses, with major 
hurricanes favoring the U.S. East Coast by late September.  Most major October hurricanes in the 
United States affect southern Florida.

(11) Whats the farthest north that a major hurricane has ever hit the United States and  
whats the latest U.S. major hurricane landfall?   Three major hurricanes have struck as far 
north as MassachusettsEdna (1954), The 1938 Long Island Express, and Storm 6 in 1869.  The 
latest in the season that a major hurricane has ever hit the United States was October 25, 1921 
(the Great Tampa Hurricane) with Wilma on October 24, 2005 being the second-latest. 
 
(12) How long has it been since a hurricane or a major hurricane struck a given 
community?    A chronological list of all known hurricanes to strike the United States from 
1851-2010 can be found in Appendix A.   Table 12 summarizes the occurrence of the last 
hurricane and major hurricane to strike the counties or parishes where most populated coastal 
communities are located from Brownsville, Texas to Eastport, Maine.  An estimated return 
period of these hurricanes is also listed, which is computed from HURISK (Neumann 1987).  
These return periods are generally larger than reported in previous versions of the document 
because a search radius of 50 n mi is used instead of 75 n mi previously. The smaller radius 
employed here is more appropriate given the average maximum extent of hurricane force winds 
of about 50 n mi. Figures 5 and 6 show these return periods for hurricanes and major hurricanes 
for points along the coast.  In order to obtain the same type of information listed in Table 12 for 
the remaining coastal communities, the reader is referred to the NOAA Coastal Services Center 
(http://csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/).  Even with these return period estimates, it should be noted that 
there is high uncertainty of when a hurricane might strike a given locality.  After nearly 70 years 
without a direct hit, Pensacola, Florida was struck in a period of 11 years by Hurricane Erin and 
major Hurricane Opal in 1995, major Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and major Hurricane Dennis in 
2005. Tampa has not experienced a major hurricane for 90 years.  Many locations along the Gulf 
and Atlantic coasts have not experienced a major hurricane since records began in 1851 (see 
Table 12). 
 
(13) What is the total United States damage (before and after adjustment for inflation) and 
death toll for each year since 1900?   Table 13a summarizes this information.  Table 13b ranks 
the top 30 years by deaths, unadjusted damage, adjusted damage and normalized damage.  In 
most years the death and damage totals are the result of a single major hurricane.  Gentry (1966) 
gives damages adjusted to 1957-59 costs as a base for the period 1915-1965.  For the most part, 
death and damage totals for the period 1915-1965 were taken from Gentry's paper and from 
1966-1994 damage totals were used from Monthly Weather Review.  From 1995-present, for 
almost every storm, the final NHC damage estimate is now the sum of double the insured loss 
estimate, plus an adjusted estimate of flood losses from NFIP.  Adjusted damage were converted 
to 2010 dollars by the factors used in Table 3a.  Note the addition of NFIP damages have 
significantly elevated some years post 1994 since the last edition of this publication. 
 
(14) What are the deadliest and costliest hurricanes to affect Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands since 1900?   Table 14, provided by Hans Rosendal and Raphael Mojica of 
the National Weather Service Forecast Offices in Honolulu and San Juan, respectively, 
summarizes this information.  Iniki in 1992 is the deadliest and costliest hurricane to affect 
Hawaii while Georges of 1998 is the costliest hurricane to affect Puerto Rico.  The notorious San 
Felipe hurricane of 1928 was the deadliest hurricane in Puerto Rico since 1900.

(15) Are there hurricane landfall cycles?   Figures 7 through 22 show the landfalling portion of 
the tracks of major hurricanes that have struck the United States between 1851-2010.  Figure 23 
shows all major hurricane strikes on the U.S. coast.  The reader might note the tendency for the 
major hurricane landfalls to cluster in certain areas during certain decades.   A comparison of 
20-year periods beginning in 1851 indicates that the major hurricanes tended to be in Gulf Coast 
states before 1891, then favored Florida and the western Gulf until 1911, shifting to the eastern 
Gulf Coast states and Florida during the next 20 years, then to Florida and the Atlantic Coast 
states during the 1940s-1950s, and back to the western Gulf Coast states in the following 20-year 
period. Most major hurricanes have recently favored Florida and the central Gulf Coast states, 
though the source of this hurricane landfall variability is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS 

 

 

In virtually every coastal city from Texas to Maine, the present National Hurricane Center 
Director (Bill Read) and former directors have stated that the United States is vulnerable to 
another hurricane disaster.  Hurricanes Katrina and Ike are sad reminders of the exposure of the 
United States to hurricanes.  The areas along the United States Gulf and Atlantic coasts where 
most of this countrys hurricane-related fatalities have occurred are also experiencing the most 
significant growth in population. The lack of coastal readiness for a hurricane, as suggested by 
Hebert et al. (1975), Jarrell et al. (1992) and Table 12, is a serious problem and could lead to 
future disasters. This situation, in combination with continued building along the coast, will lead 
to dangerous problems for many areas in hurricanes.  
 
The message to coastal residents is this: Become familiar with what hurricanes can do, develop a 
hurricane plan, and when a hurricane threatens your area, increase your chances of survival by 
executing your plan.  The largest loss of life can occur in the storm surge, so coastal residents 
should prepare to move away from the water until the hurricane has passed!  Unless this message 
is clearly understood by coastal residents through a thorough and continuing preparedness effort, 
a future disastrous loss of life is inevitable. 
 
Acknowledgments:  Paul Hebert, Glenn Taylor, Bob Case, Max Mayfield, Jerry Jarrell and Ed 
Rappaport, co-authors of previous versions of this paper, are recognized for their enduring 
contributions to this work. Andy Neal of FEMA was critical in supplying data and feedback on 
the use of NFIP flood data.

Notes: 
  
States Affected and Category by States Affected:  The impact of the hurricane on individual  
U.S. states based upon the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (through the estimate of the  
maximum sustained surface winds at each state). (TX S-South Texas, TX C-Central Texas,  
TX N-North Texas, LA-Louisiana, MS-Mississippi, AL-Alabama, FL NW-Northwest Florida, FL SW- 
Southwest Florida, FL SE-Southeast Florida, FL NE-Northeast Florida, GA-Georgia, SC-South  
Carolina, NC-North Carolina, VA-Virginia, MD-Maryland, DE-Delaware, NJ-New Jersey, NY-New York,  
PA-Pennsylvania, CT-Connecticut, RI-Rhode Island,  MA-Massachusetts, NH-New Hampshire, ME-Maine.   
In Texas, south refers to the area from the Mexican border to Corpus Christi; central spans  
from north of Corpus Christi to Matagorda Bay; and north refers to the region from north of  
Matagorda Bay to the Louisiana border.  In Florida, the north-south dividing line is from Cape  
Canaveral [28.45N] to Tarpon Springs [28.17N].  The dividing line between west and east Florida  
goes from 82.69W at the north Florida border with Georgia, to Lake Okeechobee and due south  
along longitude 80.85W.) Occasionally, a hurricane will cause a hurricane impact (estimated  
maximum sustained surface winds) in an inland state.  To differentiate these cases versus  
coastal hurricane impacts, these inland hurricane strikes are denoted with an "I" prefix before  
the state abbreviation.  States that have been so impacted at least once during this time period  
include Alabama (IAL), Georgia (IGA), North Carolina (INC), Virginia (IVA), and Pennsylvania (IPA). 
The entire Florida peninsula, by the nature of its relatively small landmass, is 
considered as coastal in this database. 
  
Highest U.S. Saffir-Simpson Category:  The highest Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale impact in  
the United States based upon estimated maximum sustained surface winds produced at the coast. 
  
Central Pressure:  The observed (or analyzed from peripheral pressure  
measurements) central pressure of the hurricane at landfall.  
  
Maximum Winds:  Estimated maximum sustained (1-min) surface (10-m) winds 
occurring along the U. S. coast.  Winds are estimated to the nearest 10 kt for the  
period of 1851 to 1885 and to the nearest 5 kt since 1886. (1 kt = 1.15 mph.) 
  
* - Indicates that the hurricane center did not make a U.S. landfall (or  
substantially weakened before making landfall), but did produce the indicated  
hurricane force winds over land.  In this case, central pressure is given for  
the hurricane's point of closest approach. 
  
& - Indicates that the hurricane center did make a direct landfall, but that  
the strongest winds likely remained offshore.  Thus the winds indicated here  
are lower than in HURDAT. 
  
# - Indicates that the hurricane made landfall over Mexico, but also caused  
sustained hurricane force surface winds in Texas.  The strongest winds at  
landfall impacted Mexico, while the weaker maximum sustained winds indicated  
here were conditions estimated to occur in Texas.  Indicated central pressure  
given is that at Mexican landfall. 
  
Additional Note:  Because of the sparseness of towns and cities before 1900 in  
some coastal locations along the United States, the above list is not complete  
for all states.  Before the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts became settled,  
hurricanes may have been underestimated in their intensity or missed completely  
for small-sized systems (e.g., 2004's Hurricane Charley).  The following list  
provides estimated dates when more complete tropical cyclone records began for  
specified regions of the United States based upon U.S Census reports and other  
historical analyses. Years in parenthesis indicate possible starting dates for  
more complete records and if that year is before the 1850s then data may be  
available with additional research:   
Texas-south > 1880, Texas-central > 1851, Texas-north > 1860, Louisiana > 1880,  
Mississippi > 1851, Alabama < 1851 (1830), Florida-northwest > 1880,  
Florida-southwest > 1900, Florida-southeast > 1900, Florida-northeast > 1880,  
Georgia < 1851 (1800), South Carolina < 1851 (1760), North Carolina < 1851 (1760),  
Virginia < 1851 (1700), Maryland   < 1851 (1760), Delaware < 1851 (1700), New  
Jersey < 1851 (1760), New York < 1851 (1700), Connecticut < 1851 (1660), Rhode  
Island < 1851 (1760), Massachusetts < 1851 (1660), New Hampshire < 1851 (1660),  
and Maine < 1851 (1790).

Appendix B 
 
Other major changes since the last edition (excluding the inclusion of NFIP flood numbers for 
1995-present): 
 
Celia (1970)The original estimate of $434 million has been replaced by an estimate of $930 
million.  The insured losses for Celia according to PCS were about $310 million.  In storms of 
that era (1965-1974), insurance rates of coverage for property were lower than today.  In 
addition, most final estimates of damages were between 2.6 and 20 times the insured losses 
reported by PCS.  Given the low coverage rates, the severe wind intensity and the historical 
average, the previous estimate of $434 million appears to be a gross underestimate.  The new 
damage estimate is a tripling of the insured losses, which were about $310 million, leaving a new 
total of $930 million. 
 
Georges (1998)The previous version of this document erroneously contained only the insured 
loss estimate, not the standard doubled estimatethis only corrects an error from the last 
editionthe NHC estimate is unchanged. 
 
Bonnie (1986)The NHC official estimate was $2 million, which is far below the PCS estimate 
of $21 million and likely based on preliminary estimates.  A standard doubling of the insured loss 
leads to an estimate of $42 million for Bonnie.  This also changes the total damage for 1986 from 
$17 million to $57 million.   
  
Florence (1988)The NHC official estimate was $2.5 million, which is below the PCS estimate 
of $10 million and was likely based on preliminary estimates.  A standard doubling of the insured 
loss leads to an estimate of $20 million for Florence. 
   
Gilbert (1988)The NHC official estimate was $50 million, but PCS has $40 million in insured 
losses. For consistency, doubling the insured loss totals for that storm leads to a final NHC 
estimate of $80 million dollars for Gilbert.  This also increases the 1988 yearly estimate (with 
Florence) by an additional $47 million. 
 
Edouard (1996)The NHC estimate was for minor unspecified damage, but PCS has $10 
million for estimated insured property losses.  A standard doubling yields $20 million in total 
damages.  This also caused a small upward increase in yearly losses for 1996.  
 
Updated PCS insurance numbers were available for several 2004 hurricanes.
