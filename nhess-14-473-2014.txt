Abstract. After an overview of existing methods, we present
a novel method of event-adjusted evaluation of extreme-
ness of weather and climate events. It is based on optimiza-
tion of both the considered area and the time duration for
every event. The method consists of three steps: (i) estima-
tion of return periods of a representative variable at indi-
vidual sites, performed separately for various time windows;
(ii) spatial interpolation of the point return period data; and
(iii) searching the area and the time window in which the
extremeness of the event was maximum. The extremeness
is quantified as the common logarithm of the spatial geo-
metric mean of the return periods multiplied by the radius
of a circle of the same area as the one over which the ge-
ometric mean is taken. The maximum product is referred
to as the weather extremity index (WEI). Two precipitation
events, which affected the Czech Republic in May and in Au-
gust 2010, were evaluated by the WEI for illustration. Vali-
dation of the method on sufficiently long data series is still
needed. Moreover, the WEI is generally applicable regardless
of the studied phenomenon (heavy rains, heat waves, wind-
storms, etc.). This makes it possible to study various weather
and climate extremes from the viewpoint of possible recent
and future changes in their frequency, seasonal distribution,
and circulation conditions accompanying them.

Introduction

Weather and climate extremes have long been the focus of
atmospheric sciences because of their significant social and
economic impacts (Cutter et al., 2008). This effort has even
increased during recent decades in the context of discussions
of climate change impacts (Beniston and Stephenson, 2004).
In the 1980s, Wigley (1988; reprinted in 2009) showed that

even a small shift in the mean and variance of a climate vari-
able might lead to a strong shift in the frequency of respective
weather and climate extremes. Since this time, many stud-
ies have focused on the analysis of past and possible future
trends in extremes (e.g., Alexander et al., 2006; Klein Tank
et al., 2006). Katz (2010) noted that not only the frequency
but also the magnitude of extreme events should be consid-
ered in this type of study. The reason is that detected trends
in more extreme events can be more (or less) significant than
trends in moderate extreme events (Hegerl et al., 2004).

A similarly large group of papers is concerned with me-
teorological causes of weather and climate extremes (e.g.,
Homar et al., 2007; Lupikasza, 2010). As in the above-
mentioned type of study, the authors often select a group
of extreme events and avoid quantifying their extremeness.
However, considering all events as equally extreme can
thwart discovering substantial differences in causes between
more and less extreme events (Muller and Kaspar, 2010).

Obviously, one of the crucial challenges to authors of both
presented types of studies is the correct selection of extreme
events and evaluation of their extremeness. Our research is
motivated by the fact that the selection method can substan-
tially influence the results of a study (Visser and Petersen,
2012). In accordance with Diaz and Murnane (2008), we
differentiate between short-term weather events (e.g., heavy
rainfall) and longer-lived climate events (e.g., extra wet sea-
son). We focus mainly on weather extremes in the present
study. The extremeness of climate events can be evaluated
by similar methods when only the type of input data makes
the difference (e.g., daily and monthly sums for weather and
climate extremes, respectively). After a brief overview of the
commonly used methods (Sect. 2), we present two weather
events (Sect. 3) and demonstrate a novel method of event-
adjusted extremity evaluation (Sect. 4), which is generally

applicable regardless of the type of event. We lastly compare
this method with other methods and discuss the benefits and
limits of the proposed method (Sect. 5).

2 Approaches to weather extremity evaluation

There is no unified method of defining extreme weather
events and quantifying their extremeness because extreme
events are generally easy to recognize but difficult to define
(Stephenson, 2008, p. 12). The main reason is that the events
can vary in terms of short-term intensity, duration, areal ex-
tent, socioeconomic impacts, etc. Beniston et al. (2007) sum-
marized three characteristics that are generally used to iden-
tify weather (climate) events as extreme: (i) rarity, (ii) in-
tensity, and (iii) severity (amount of socioeconomic losses or
number of casualties). Subsequently, the definition criteria of
extreme events also vary as they reflect these aspects.

The concept of severity is useful in many applications: for
example, in insurance (Mills, 2005). If we carefully consider
aspects of inflation, population and property growth, their re-
distribution, etc., we can study possible trends (e.g., Balling
and Cerveny, 2003; Bouwer, 2011). The aspect of severity
can also be very useful in branches in which we need to take
into account extremeness in both the driver and the response,
such as in ecology (Smith, 2011). Nevertheless, severity al-
ways includes not only hazard but also other factors of the

risk  exposure and vulnerability  which are not related to
natural processes (Stephenson, 2008). Therefore, this mea-
sure cannot reasonably be used for evaluation of the extreme-
ness of weather events if we, for example, compare it with the
extremity of causal circulation conditions (Cavazos, 1999).
For such research, aspects of rarity or intensity (often corre-
lated) seem to be more suitable. Both can be evaluated using
data either from individual sites (Sect. 2.1) or from the entire
affected area (Sect. 2.2).

2.1 Point evaluation of extremeness of weather events

The most popular approach to the extremeness evaluation of
weather events is based on quantifying the intensity of a vari-
able at individual sites and on comparing the values with a
fixed threshold. For example, precipitation can be consid-
ered to be extreme if the total reaches 50 mm or more at
a site during 24 h (probability of exceeding this threshold be-
longs to ensemble prediction system products prescribed by
the WMO, 1992). Extreme events are then defined as peaks
over the threshold and, if needed, ordered with respect to the
magnitude of the variable. This works if we study a single
time series. In contrast, if extreme events are collected from
various sites, this approach does not reflect the differences
in climate among the sites. In the above-mentioned exam-
ple, the daily total of 50 mm can be rather frequent at a site,
whereas it is very rare at another one (in Fig. 1, there are

of such defined extreme events would be mainly composed
of those from exposed sites ( mountain gauges); this fact
can substantially influence our inferences from the analysis
of the data set.

not represent the actual probability of occurrence of a value.
Nevertheless, they still can be utilized to compare various
events from the viewpoint of weather extremity (see Sect. 4).

2.2 Regional evaluation of the extremeness of weather

Considering the rarity of measured values, the set of block
maxima obviously also cannot be identified with the com-
plete set of extreme events because extreme events are not
equally distributed in time (in Fig. 1, for example, even the
fourth highest daily total in 2002 was higher than the annual
maximum in the next year in Churanov). Therefore, thresh-
olds are used when studying the rarity of weather as well;
nevertheless, thresholds are based on the empirical distribu-
tion of the variable at the given site (Stephenson, 2008). They
can be defined most easily as quantiles (e.g., Zhang et al.,
2011). The set of extreme events then comprises an equal
number of events from all sites (in Fig. 1, there are 18 events
at both sites if the threshold is set to 99.9 %). However, the
values of the quantiles reflect only the ranking of the totals
within the data set rather than real differences among the val-
ues (in Fig. 1, for example, the difference between the sec-
ond and the third highest total is much larger than between
the third and the fourth one in Churanov; however, the differ-
ence between respective quantiles is constant). We therefore
need to search for a more sophisticated method of standard-
ization for station data (Beirlant et al., 2004).

One possible method is to divide actual values by the an-
nual mean or better by the average annual maximum of the
representative variable. Using this procedure, we obtain di-
mensionless (standardized) values that enable us to com-
bine extremes from various sites (in Fig. 1, there are 28 and
25 days with totals higher than the average annual maximum
daily total in Churanov and in Prague, respectively). Though
standardized values from gauges with different means can be
rather similar, the method distinctively favors gauges with a
higher variability in the studied variable. Moreover, events
with different durations cannot be compared this way be-
cause the variability depends, among other things, on the
considered length of the events.

A more accurate frequency analysis of extreme events re-
sults in return period estimates (see Sect. 4.1 for more de-
tails). They reflect the statistical distribution of extreme val-
ues and, moreover, they are generally applicable and com-
parable regardless of, for example, the accumulation period
of precipitation (Ramos et al., 2005) and even of the type of
studied weather extremes. Hydrologists construct intensity
durationfrequency (IDF) curves that make it possible to es-
timate return periods of observed rainfall intensities over a
range of durations (Chow et al., 1988). This implies that this
method already reflects the aspect of duration that is further
discussed along with the spatial aspect in Sect. 2.2.

It must be noted that the concept of return periods can only
be applied under the assumption of stationarity of the climate
(Katz, 2010). In a nonstationary climate, return periods do

In fact, a weather event always affects at least a small area.
Obviously, the extremeness of an event increases with the af-
fected area. Though carefully evaluated, data from the only
meteorological gauge (in contrast to the hydrological one) do
not distinguish large events from only local episodes. More-
over, events also differ in their duration. As a result, more so-
phisticated methods of evaluating weather extremes need to
reflect not only the magnitude of a variable at a site but also
both the spatial and temporal aspects  most importantly, the
extent and duration of the event, respectively. This challenge
corresponds to one of the methodological issues addressed at
the WCRP workshop in Paris, September 2010: the require-
ment of an enhanced emphasis . . . on spatiotemporal scales
of extreme events (Zolina et al., 2011, p. 17).

The temporal aspect of weather extremes is considered
more frequently. For instance, not only maximum daily pre-
cipitation totals but also 5-day totals belong to standard in-
dices of weather extremes (Frich et al., 2002). However,
the duration of the events can be very variable. Biondi et
al. (2005) therefore quantified past climatic episodes in terms
of two random variables, i.e., duration and magnitude, and
calculated conditional probabilities of exceeding both of
them. Nevertheless, the extremity of weather is also influ-
enced by the fluctuation of the variable during the event. Be-
gueria et al. (2009) partly took account of this fact; they used
declustering of daily precipitation totals for distinguishing
individual precipitation events and characterized them by not
only magnitude and duration but also by peak intensity.

The spatial aspect of weather extremity can be considered
by using the areal average of a variable (rather than individ-
ual point measurements). Nevertheless, this method does not
reflect variability within the affected area. Moreover, when
calculated within a fixed region (an administrative unit, a
catchment, etc.), the areal average disadvantages events that
are violent but affect only a part of the region. The extreme-
ness of an event depends thus on the extent of the considered
region (Konrad, 2001).

Ren et al. (2012) recently tried to combine both aspects
together and identified regional extreme events as a string
of daily impacted areas. They applied distinct thresholds to
daily data to tailor the considered areas and time period to the
real extent and duration of the event. This method seems to
be promising; however, it is very threshold-sensitive. At this
point, we need to address a crucial issue in the evaluation of
weather extremity: the limits of both the affected area and
the time period are fuzzy (not rigorous). Obviously, most
weather extremes gradually intensify at the beginning (and
they weaken later), and their central parts are surrounded by

less seriously affected areas. Should only the center of the
event (both from the spatial and temporal perspective) with
a high magnitude of the variable be taken into account, or
should less extreme peripheries also be considered?

This problem can be partly solved by visualization tools,
as follows. Andreadis et al. (2005) and, more recently,
Sheffield et al. (2009) studied extreme droughts in the US
and from a global perspective, respectively. For each extent
of the considered area, they determined the highest recorded
average drought index. To demonstrate the relationship be-
tween the mean severity of drought and the size of the consid-
ered area, the authors adopted depthareaduration (DAD)
curves (Nicks and Igo, 1980) for which they replaced rainfall
depth by normalized severity of drought. Several severity
areaduration (SAD) curves were combined, one for each
considered time window.

Another example of the graphical approach to weather
extremity evaluation is the visualization of heavy rainfalls
by severity graphs and diagrams suggested by Ramos et
al. (2005). (The term severity is used by them with a dif-
ferent meaning than by Beniston et al., 2007.) These visu-
alization tools are based on two concepts: IDF curves (see
Sect. 2.1) and areal reduction factors (ARFs), which were
recently reviewed by Svensson and Jones (2010). Ramos et
al. (2005) assumed ARFs to be independent of the return
period and applicable over the entire (rather small) area of
their interest. For each rain gauge, severity graphs depict re-
turn periods of maximum rainfall intensities for gradually in-
creasing rainfall duration. They make it possible to compare
different events because they show the variety of return peri-
ods among rain gauges and among rainfall durations. Sever-
ity diagrams are even more complex; they also include the
spatial aspect of extreme events and indicate the possible si-
multaneous occurrence of extreme point rainfall in time.

SAD curves and mainly severity diagrams are great tools
for conducting a complex analysis of weather and climate
events. However, because of their graphical character, they
cannot readily be used for a synthesis  an unambiguous
evaluation and comparison of the extremeness of events. At
this point, we suggest a method of event-adjusted evalua-
tion that is based on optimization of both the considered area
and the time duration for every event (Sect. 4).

3 Reference events and data

The proposed method of weather extremity evaluation is
demonstrated by two precipitation events that affected cen-
tral Europe in 2010. We used daily precipitation totals from
the whole territory of the Czech Republic (measured by the
Czech Hydrometeorological Institute). Apart from daily to-
tals, 2-day and 3-day totals were also calculated by the classi-
cal moving-window procedure. We also show selected daily
totals from neighboring countries in Fig. 2: from Slovakia
(Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute), Poland (Institute of

Meteorology and Water Management), and Germany (Ger-
man Weather Service). Unfortunately, the external data could
not be analyzed in terms of their extremeness because we
do not know the parameters of the statistical distribution of
the precipitation totals for the foreign gauges. Therefore, the
analysis of the extremeness of the events is limited by the
state border of the Czech Republic.

3.1 May 2010 event

Flooding occurred in the eastern part of central Europe in the
second half of May 2010. The antecedent saturation of the
region was high due to rains that occurred at the beginning

of the month (Danhelka and Sercl, 2011). Extra-heavy rains
that reached their maximum on 16 May were associated with
a cyclone passing from the Mediterranean northeastward,
which became nearly stationary over Ukraine for several
days. The highest precipitation totals were recorded in the
western sector of the cyclone at the state border between the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. Subsequently, the wa-
ter stages were even higher than those during the catastrophic
flood in July 1997 in some regions, mainly in the upper
reaches of the Vistula River in Poland (Bissolli et al., 2011).
In the Czech Republic, peak flows reached return periods of
more than 50 yr at some gauges. Moreover, because heavy
precipitation fell over the flysch Outer Western Carpathians,
which are susceptible to landslides, the storm also had geo-
morphologic impacts. More than 150 mostly small landslides
originated only in the eastern part of the Czech Republic, in-
cluding a kilometer-long rockslide along the southern slope
of Mt. Girova in the Beskydy mountains (Panek et al., 2011).

3.2 August 2010 event

During the first days of August 2010, flooding occurred in
many rivers over the western part of the Czech Republic,
with high return periods concentrated in a rather small re-
gion at the state border between the Czech Republic, Ger-
many, and Poland (Fig. 2). Heavy rains reaching their maxi-
mum on 7 August were more concentrated in time than they
were in May. They were associated with a rather shallow cy-
clone passing from the Mediterranean to the north. The most
affected river basins were the Lausitzer Neisse (a left-sided
tributary of the Oder) and the neighboring right-sided tribu-
taries of the Elbe (Muller and Walther, 2011). The water lev-
els were the highest ever recorded at some smaller streams.
Moreover, the flood caused the Niedow Dam on the river
Witka to break.

4 Event-adjusted evaluation of weather extremity

The proposed method of weather extremity evaluation con-
sists of three steps presented in the following sections. We
first evaluate the rarity of a representative meteorological
variable at individual sites (Sect. 4.1). Despite the procedure
used by Ramos et al. (2005) and other authors, we do not
transform the detected point return periods into the areal ones
(Sect. 2.2). Instead of this process, we interpolate the point
return period data in space so that we can estimate a point
return period in every pixel of the studied area (Sect. 4.2).
We lastly accumulate return periods from individual pixels
and look for the optimal area and time period in which the
proposed measure of extremity was the highest (Sect. 4.3).

4.1 Point evaluation of weather extremity

As we have already discussed in Sect. 2.1, return periods are
likely the most accurate instrument for quantifying the rarity
of measured data at individual sites because they reflect the
shape of the statistical distribution of data. The first step of
the proposed methodology is a standard estimation of return
periods of a representative variable at individual sites. Nev-
ertheless, the estimation is performed separately for various
time windows. In our case studies, return periods of daily,
2-day, and 3-day precipitation totals were assessed using
the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution (Hosking
and Wallis, 1997) because it was found to represent a suit-
able model for precipitation extremes in most regions of the
Czech Republic (Kysely and Picek, 2007). The GEV distri-
bution was applied as the parametric model for annual max-
ima of precipitation totals. Parameters of the GEV distribu-
tion were estimated by means of the L-moment algorithm
(Hosking and Wallis, 1997) and the regional frequency anal-
ysis  region-of-influence (ROI) method (Burn, 1990). The
ROI method employs homogenous regions, in which all
regional data, weighted by a dissimilarity measure, are used
for estimating parameters of the distribution of extremes at
the site of interest. The advantage of the ROI method com-
pared with the local analysis is that sampling variations in
the estimates of model parameters and high quantiles may be
substantially reduced, and the inference becomes more ro-
bust. Most recently, this fact was confirmed also for the Au-
gust 2010 reference event (Kysely et al., 2013).

The application of the ROI method allowed us to utilize
data from more than 600 rain gauges from the Czech Repub-
lic with daily data series of at least 20 yr and to consider the
estimates of return periods up to 1000 yr. In fact, so high a
value did not occur either in May or in August 2010. How-
ever, the maximum return period reached at an individual
gauge does not reflect the spatial aspect of weather extremity,
as demonstrated in the following sections.

4.2 Spatial interpolation of return period data

Ramos et al. (2005) stated that attributing a single return
period to a storm event observed over a given area is not
straightforward because the severity of a storm varies de-
pending on the considered space- and time integration scales.
Nevertheless, we decided to solve the problem in a different
way than they did  namely by the interpolation of point re-
turn periods into a regular grid. Our motivation is to avoid
the uncertainty regarding ARF (see Sect. 2.2).

A common procedure involves the interpolation of statisti-
cal distribution parameters from individual gauges (Ceresetti
et al., 2012). However, we were confronted with a different
task: interpolation of return period values. When searching
for a proper interpolation method, we excluded all standard
methods because of the exponential nature of the GEV dis-
tribution that the return period values are derived from (see

www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/14/473/2014/

discussion in Sect. 5). We therefore first transformed return
periods into their common logarithms. We then interpolated
the logarithms by linear kriging into a regular grid with a
horizontal resolution of 1 km. Lastly, the interpolated data
were reconverted into return period values using the inverse
logarithmic transformation. The procedure is repeated for all
considered time windows.

The results for our reference events are depicted in Fig. 3.
Despite the similarities in maximum daily totals (Fig. 2), the
respective return periods were substantially higher in August
than in May. The events were mostly similar regarding re-
turn periods of 3-day totals because of the shorter duration
of the August precipitation event. While precipitation fell in
the mountain region that is prone to heavy, long-lasting rains
in May (Kysely and Picek, 2007), the August event also af-
fected regions where heavy rains are rare.

4.3 Optimization of the considered area and the time

window

We stated in Sect. 4.1 that the maximum return period
reached at an individual gauge does not reflect the spatial
aspect of weather extremity. However, neither does the av-
erage within the whole Czech Republic because heavy rains
usually affect only a part of the territory, as was the case both
in May and in August 2010 (Fig. 2). Moreover, the events hit
different regions with different extents, so their extremeness
cannot readily be evaluated within a unified area. We there-
fore study a unique area for each weather event.

Obviously, the considered area has to comprise the region
where the studied phenomenon reached the highest extreme-
ness. The area does not have to be compact because of, for
example, the role of topography (see Fig. 2). Thus, we sort
grid pixels with respect to return period values in descending
order (Fig. 4) and average the pixels with the highest values.
Because of the above-mentioned exponential nature of the
GEV distribution, we calculate the spatial geometric (instead
qYn
of arithmetic) mean of return periods [yr]
Gt a = n

Nt i ,

i=1

(1)

where Nt i is the return period of the studied variable in a grid
point i and a time period t and n is the number of considered
grid points each representing 1 km2. The problem is that the
mean return period continuously decreases with the extend-
ing area (Fig. 5). How does one recognize the edge that de-
limits the optimal area? Moreover, how does one select the
optimal duration of the event when the curves intersect each
other (meaning the optimal duration changes with the size of
the considered area)? The classical approach is to fix subjec-
tively the time window (e.g., 3 days) and either the consid-
ered return periods (e.g., by the threshold N = 10 yr) or the
extent of the considered area (e.g., n = 1000). We search for
an alternative way by adjusting the thresholds to the actual
event.

Fig. 3. Return periods of precipitation totals in May 2010 and in
August 2010 (the right and left part of the figure, respectively), in-
terpolated into the 1 km grid. Each event is represented by a 1-day,
2-day, and 3-day period with maximum return periods. The opti-
mized areas affected in the given time period (see Sect. 4.3) are
depicted by orange lines. Colors of circles correspond with Figs. 4,
5, 6, and 7.

Our proposal is based on the assumption that the most ex-
treme event has to be both intense (rare) and large. Lower
extremeness of other events can be due to the decrease in the
intensity (rarity) and/or the spatial extent of an event. As a
result, a proper extremity index should, in our opinion, be a
product of a measure of rarity and of a measure of the spatial
extent. Regarding the first factor, we use log(Gt a) instead of
pure Gt a because of the exponential nature of return periods.
If the second factor of the product was simply the area (a),
the product would increase continuously because log(Gt a)
decreases at a much lower rate than a increases. Obviously,
the spatial extent should be considered with a smaller weight

the maximum of Et a characterizes the extremeness of the
phenomenon within the time period t. This point represents
the inflection point of the curve in Fig. 5; at this point, the
decrease in the mean extremeness represented by log(Gt a)
becomes more significant than the increase in the area repre-
sented by R.

We lastly choose the time period for which Et a reached
its maximum during the event. We call this value the weather
extremity index (WEI) because it represents the searched ex-
tremeness of the event. Its unit is log(yr)km. Now, we can
also define the affected area a, the duration t, and the respec-
tive geometric mean of return periods Gt a complying with
the relation Et a = WEI.
Any weather or climate event can be evaluated by the WEI
and by related characteristics. The comparison of the two
studied precipitation events is demonstrated by diagrams in
Fig. 7. The main difference is that the affected area a was
much larger (within the Czech Republic) in August. How-
ever, log(Gt a) was slightly lower because compared with
May, a larger part of the affected area was characterized by
rains with relatively low return periods in August (see also
Fig. 3). Both events were rated as 2-day events; nevertheless,
the difference between 2-day and 3-day values of Et a was
negligible in May.

precipitation totals in Fig. 4 as a function of increasing area.

in order to balance it with the measure of the rarity log(Gt a)
which has a linear nature. We have chosen a simple and rea-
sonable way to reduce the weight of a: the square root that
represents the length. The main reason for this is that this
approach enables the affected area to be unambiguously de-
limited, as presented below.

We proposed the following variable Et a [log(yr)km]:
Et a = log (Gt a) R =

i=1 log (Nt i )

which is defined by a product of log(Gt a) and of the radius R
of a circle of the same area (a) as the one over which Gt a is
taken. Alternatively, log(Gt a) can be simply computed also
as the arithmetic mean of common logarithms of return peri-
ods. Unlike Gt a (Fig. 5), Et a increases initially as we accu-
mulate the pixels with high return periods. However, once the
return periods are not high enough in the additional accumu-
lated pixels, the value of Et a starts to decrease. This occurs
when the decrease in the return periods is more significant
than the increase in the accumulated area (Fig. 6). The tip-
ping point of the curve is the focus of our interest because

5 Discussion

In the couple of presented examples, we used daily precipi-
tation totals when evaluating the extremeness of heavy rain
events. To evaluate longer events properly, we estimated re-
turn periods of totals accumulated during 2 and 3 days (even
longer time windows can be studied). In contrast, a precipi-
tation event can last less than 1 day. Obviously, it would be
better to use short-term precipitation intensities and their re-
turn periods (3 h, 6 h, etc.). However, the density and length
of their data series are not sufficient for these purposes. As a

result, it should be taken into account that the extremeness of
such events (usually produced by convective storms) can be
slightly underestimated by the WEI because they are com-
pared by the same tool with events when precipitation actu-
ally fell the whole day. For example, return periods of 6 h to-
tals would be higher than if they are evaluated as 1-day totals.
In future we plan to also employ return periods of short-term
precipitation intensities using temporal statistical downscal-
ing of daily totals.

The estimation of return periods at gauges is method-
sensitive, which can increase the uncertainty of the extrem-
ity evaluation. We applied the GEV distribution; parameters
were estimated by means of the L-moment algorithm. The
distribution of precipitation extremes is usually heavy-tailed.
If not, return period estimates can reach unrealistically high
values. We therefore decided to restrict the estimates to a
maximum of 1000 yr. We also used the ROI method, making
the results more robust. Even if a less sophisticated method
is used, the influence of this type of uncertainty is substan-
tially reduced in our methodology because we use common
logarithms of return periods rather than mere values of them.
An additional step in the suggested methodology is the in-
terpolation of point values of return periods into a regular
grid. We do not estimate return periods of areal precipitation
totals. On the other hand, this approach prevents us from in-
creasing the uncertainty by interpolation both precipitation
totals and GEV parameters. Again, the interpolation method
can influence the acquired results. Because the spatial distri-
bution of return period values does not fully correspond with
the respective totals, methods used for precipitation interpo-
lation cannot reasonably be applied in this case. A strong

polation of return periods, and (2) linear interpolation of common

emphasis should be placed on the finding that if return peri-
ods are interpolated, it is necessary to reflect their nonlinear
dependence on the totals. We decided to interpolate common
logarithms; our reasoning can be demonstrated by the fol-
lowing example (Fig. 8).

Consider two gauges at the distance of 8 km, having the
same parameters of the GEV distribution. Gauge A mea-
sured a daily total of 35.6 mm, which corresponds to the re-
turn period of 2 yr; gauge B measured 100 mm (return pe-
riod of 100 yr). The application of linear interpolation of the

return period values leads to an increase in the return period
by the value of 12.25 yr per 1 km in the line from gauge A
to gauge B. As a result, corresponding precipitation totals in-
crease much more rapidly in the vicinity of gauge A than B.
In fact, we could expect a linear increase in precipitation be-
tween A and B, which is satisfied when logarithms of return
period values are interpolated.

The final step of our methodology optimizes the consid-
ered area and the time window for every studied event. Even
if the area is divided into several parts, or if days with heavy
rains are separated by a slightly drier episode, they are con-
sidered as a whole due to the accumulated effect of precipita-
tion. We aggregate grid pixels with high return period values
and compute their geometric mean within the given area. The
optimization is enabled by multiplication of the common log-
arithm of the geometric mean by the radius of an equivalent
circle area. We find the product Et a of these two factors well
balanced because both are linear in nature. As a result, Et a
increases with increasing a only as long as pixels with high
return periods are added. This shape of the Et a curve allows
for objective optimization of the considered area and com-
parison of a weather (climate) extreme with other events.

In Table 1, the values of the WEI are compared with other
characteristics of extremity that were discussed in Sect. 2.
Aside from the maximum daily total at a site, the August
event was more extreme in the Czech Republic with respect
to all other characteristics, including the WEI; this corre-
sponds to the hydrological response, which was also more
extreme in August, when return periods of peak flows sur-
passed 100 yr at some rivers in northern Bohemia (Kaspar et
al., 2013).

Nevertheless, the WEI can be applied regardless the type
of weather (climate) extremes. It reflects both the spatial and
the temporal aspects of the studied event. Unlike classical
indices, the WEI is not threshold-dependent in terms of the
considered area and the applied time window. As a result, it
enables the extremeness of rather heterogenous events to be
compared.

6 Conclusions

The suggested methodology takes into account both the spa-
tial and the temporal aspects of weather and climate extremes
and is generally applicable regardless of the studied phe-
nomenon (heavy rains, heat waves, cold spells, windstorms,
etc.). The only condition is that the phenomenon is quanti-
fied by a proper variable (precipitation totals, daily temper-
ature maxima and minima, etc.). The methodology reflects
spatial differences in the climatology of the variable; return
periods are therefore utilized rather than mere values of the
variable. The evaluation of extremeness is event-adjusted,
which means that it is based on optimization of both the con-
sidered area and time duration for every event. The suggested
WEI makes it possible to evaluate weather and climate ex-
tremes quantitatively. As a result, extremes can be studied
more precisely from the viewpoint of possible recent and fu-
ture changes in their frequency, seasonal distribution, circu-
lation conditions accompanying them, etc.

The WEI can be computed within any region of inter-
est (for example, administrative units). We demonstrated
the methodology within the territory of the Czech Republic
and prepare several papers regarding temperature, precipita-
tion, and wind extremes in the Czech territory. Nevertheless,
both presented precipitation events also affected neighboring
countries. The events could also be evaluated as a whole if
respective data were at our disposal. Furthermore, if the WEI
of a precipitation event is computed within individual catch-
ments, values of the WEI can be easily compared with runoff
extremeness, thus making it possible to study relationships
between extremeness of precipitation events and of subse-
quent floods.

There is one more aspect of weather and climate extremes
that has not been discussed in the presented paper: we can
consider not only the spatial differences in climatology of
the studied phenomenon but also the temporal ones. For ex-
ample, heavy rains are concentrated in summer in the Czech
Republic (Tolasz et al., 2007). If we define extremes as the
events that are the most different from seasonally normal
conditions, then they can occur during the whole year. In
