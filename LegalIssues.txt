Constraints on Network Research

 U.S. law is often unclear (and

unfriendly).

 Ethical issues are novel, and the
scientific context changes rapidly.

Electronic Communications

Privacy Act (ECPA)

 Wiretap Act (18 U.S.C.  2510-22)

 Prohibits real-time interception of communications

contents

 Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. 

2701-110)
 Prohibits certain disclosures of content and

noncontent/addressing information

 Pen/Trap statute (18 U.S.C.  3121-27)

 Prohibits real-time interception of

noncontent/addressing information

No Research Exemptions in

ECPA!

 Some trace collection permitted by:

 Consent of users or
 Provider exception (allowing network

operators to monitor networks to defend them)

 Limitations

 Individual consent hard to get
 Blanket consent (e.g., as part of a networks

terms of service) may provide little information
about data collection, use

 Provider exception requires collaboration with

operational IT staff

Other Privacy Issues

 State laws

 Two-party rule in state wiretap laws

 International laws

 EU member nations generally have stricter

privacy laws

 Interaction with human subjects

regulations

How ECPA Affects

Cybersecurity Research (1)
 Activity: Collecting full-packet traces in real-

time
 Relevant law: Wiretap Act
 Applies to any network (government, enterprise,

WiFi, university, etc.)

 Need consent or sufficient link to operational

network protection for provider exception

 Wiretap Act continues to cover traces after they

are recorded If collection violates law,
disclosure probably does too.

How ECPA Affects

Cybersecurity Research (2)

 Activity: Collecting packet-header

traces in real-time
 Relevant law: Pen/Trap statute
 Consent, provider exceptions available
 Also an exception for network operation,

maintenance, and testing

 Legally stored data become subject to SCA

How ECPA Affects

Cybersecurity Research (3)
 Activity: Sharing or publishing packet traces

 Relevant law: SCA

 Applies only to public service providers: commercial

ISPs but not businesses

 Full-packet traces: disclosure prohibited without

consent, subpoena

 Packet header traces: disclosure allowed unless

given to governmental entity
 Much broader than law enforcement; hampers some

public releases

COMPUTER FRAUD &
ABUSE ACT (CFAA)

Copyright 2009 Aaron Burstein.  Some rights reserved:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/.

CFAA & Network Research

 Botnet infiltration (and response?)

 Running malicious code in testbeds

 Collecting data from online services

 Running honeynets to interact with

attackers

Copyright 2009 Aaron Burstein.  Some rights reserved:

CFAA Elements

 Protected computer

 Any computer connected to the Internet

 Access

 Not defined in statute

 Authorization

 Not defined in statute

 Obtaining information / causing loss

 Penalties scale with type, value of information

obtained

 Loss is not defined

Is the CFAA as Broad as It Sounds?

 Perhaps . . .
 United States v. Lori Drew (2009)

 Access means to obtain information from
 Authorization may be set by Terms of Service
 But U.S. Const. limits criminal application of

CFAA in TOS breach cases.
 Insufficient clarity + arbitrary enforcement =

unconstitutional vagueness

Testbeds: Legal Issues

 Concern: What if worms, viruses

escape testbed containment?

 CFAA prohibits (1) knowingly causing

transmission of code and
(2)intentionally or recklessly causing
damage

 Unclear whether accidents meet this standard

of intent

ETHICAL ISSUES

Copyright 2009 Aaron Burstein.  Some rights reserved:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/.

Overview

1. Basic ethical principles / theories

2. Human subjects research and ethical

compliance

Ethical Frameworks

 Consequentialism

 The moral rightness of an act depends

only on its consequences.

 Deontological theories

 Morality is prescribed by individual rights,

duties.

Research Ethics

 Belmont Report crafted principles for

human subjects research (HSR)
 Respect for persons
 Beneficence
 Justice

 Common Rule codifies Belmont principles
 Defines research, human subject, consent,

institutional review board (IRB)

 Applies to any HSR at an organization receiving

federal research funding

Ethical Trouble Spots for

Network Research

 Is it HSR?
 Waiver of Informed Consent

 May be waived if impracticable to obtain

 Deception

 Minimal risk
 No adverse effect on subjects rights, welfare
 Non-deceptive research design impracticable

IRB Review: Easing the Pain

 Exemptions

 Studies of existing, publicly available data
 Studies of data recorded so that subjects cannot

be identified, directly or through IDs

 Note: IRB decides whether research is exempt.

 Expedited review

 Research involves no more than minimal risk
 Allows quick(er) protocol approval

Ethics Beyond HSR Issues

 Harm to the researchers organization (e.g.,

university)

 Harm to other users
 Accelerating the arms race
 Confusing researchers roles

 When to report malicious activity to . . .

 Victims?
 Law enforcement?

Law & Ethics in Research Frontiers

 Studies of security-related behavior

 Downloading malware
 Checking binary signatures
 Ignoring A/V warnings
 Conditioning users to ignore security
 Infiltrating cybercrime organizations
 DMCA take down studies
 Active probes

Security Analysis of Software

Software Analysis: Legal

Issues

 Issues

 Finding software vulnerabilities
 Publishing results

 Relevant laws:

 Contract law (EULAs,

clickwrap/shrinkwrap licenses)

 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

Software Analysis: Contract

Issues

 EULAs typically prohibit reverse

engineering, other processes that
reveal vulnerabilities

 Courts usually enforce them . . .
 . . . but important issues remain

unsettled:
 Pre-emption by patent law
 Tension with First Amendment

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/.

Software Analysis: DMCA Issues



No person shall circumvent a technological
measure that effectively controls access to a work
protected by the Copyright Act

 But: courts, U.S. DOJ have found that the DMCA

does not prohibit conducting research on or
publishing papers about software vulnerabilities.

 Caveats:

DMCA.

 Publishing actual circumvention software might violate

 Restrictions in EULAs still apply.
