FOREST ECOSYSTEMS

A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic 
community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.

ForeSt eCoSySteMS

While trees sometimes stand alone, most often they 
are part of a community called a forest. Forests 
consist not only of living (biotic) components like 
trees, animals, plants, and other living things but 
also of nonliving (abiotic) components such as soil, 
water, air, and landforms. All of these components 
together make up a forest ecosystem. 

All food chains consist of:
 
 

  Producersorganisms that produce energy
  Consumersorganisms that consume producers 

and other consumers

 

  Decomposersorganisms that consume produc-

ers and consumers, and provide nutrients into 
the soil.

Systems
Forests are more than collections of living and 
nonliving things found in the same place. Their 
many components are connected to each other 
as food chains of interdependence. Food chains 
move the basic requirements for lifeenergy, 
water, carbon, air, and nutrientsin a series of 
connections and processes. 

Applying the system above to a simple real-world 
example is as follows:
 

  Producer: grass (produces energy from the sun 

and nutrients)

 
 

  Consumer: deer (eats grass)
  Decomposer: worms (eats deer, creates nutrients 

from which grasses can grow).

The sun provides energy to the forest. Trees and 
other plants (producers) use photosynthesis to 

Simplified food web

Several food chains linked together are known as a food web. Plants capture energy from the sun, but plants, 
animals, and decomposers move energy from individual to individual in an intricate web of relationships.

busily photosynthesizing sunlight, carbon dioxide, 
and water to create oxygen and sugar. In turn, all 
organisms depend on oxygen and sugar for sur-
vival. Some of the animals that dwell in the canopy 
include eagles, bats, and insects. 

In the understory, where the tops of smaller trees 
absorb whatever sunlight reaches them, a variety of 
birds and smaller mammals such as warblers and red 
squirrels eat their suppers and make their nests.

Beneath that, in the head-high shrub layer made up 
of saplings and smaller woody plants such as alder 
and chokecherry, berries and berry-eaters abound. 
Also in the shrub layer reside browsers such as 
white-tailed deer, black flies, and mosquitoes.

Even lower, in the herb layer, seedlings, grasses, and 
forbs nonwoody plants such as ferns, sedges, and 
wildflowerslive and die, providing food and 
habitat in the process for mice, insects, 
snakes, and more.

The forest floor, though 
not their exclusive 
home, is the 
 kingdom of the 
decomposers 
such as 
insects, 
bacteria,   
and fungi. 
Decom-
posers

bodies of 
plants and animals

create rich soil.

transform the suns energy into glucose (sugars). 
Consumersplant-eating animals such as 
caterpillars, chickadees, and deer, and animal-
eating predators such as coyotes, woodpeckers, and 
spidersget their energy from other living things. 
Decomposers such as sowbugs, fungi, and bacteria 
get their energy from dead plants and animals. 

Several food chains linked together are known as a 
food web. Every collection of individuals, connections, 
or processes that regularly interacts and depends on 
other individuals, connections, or processes forms 
a unified whole called a system. While each system 
depends on all other systems, when change occurs (as 
it always does), the web adapts and adjusts, flexibly. 

Oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen all 
move in natural cycles through the forest. Along with 
carbon dioxide (from the air) and water (from the 
soil), energy from the sun triggers photosynthesis 
in plants, which produces oxygen. Then, plants and 
animals use oxygen and respire carbon dioxide and 
water. Water cycles from the sky to earth and back 
again, often after spending days, months, or years 
cycling through lakes, rivers, groundwater reservoirs, 
and living things. Nitrogen and other nutrients cycle 
among soil, water, air, and living things.

As you can see, numerous cycles overlap and depend 
on each other to keep in balance. Everything in the 
forest is connected to everything else. That means it 
is impossible to make a change in just one part of 
the system. Any alteration, whether intentional or 
accidental, will have effects that ripple throughout 
the entire ecosystem. 

Layers
Many forests contain several different heights or 
layers of plants. And, as different animals are often 
found within each layer, the diversity of animals is 
often related to plant diversity in the forest. 

Imagine, for a moment, standing in a sun-filtered 
stand of mature aspen interspersed with a few white 
and red pines, remnants of the great northern 
forest that once stretched across the 
brow of Minnesota. Some 60 feet 
(18 meters) above you, resides the 
top layer, or canopy, 
of the forest.

This soil in turn provides the nutrients and moisture 
that trees and other plants need to thriveand the 
cycle begins again.

What Lives in the Forest?
The animals of Minnesotas forests come in many 
sizes and shapes, from tiny mites that inhabit the 
soil to towering moose and bulky bears. Same with 
plants, which can be as minute as mosses or lichen 
or as large as giant oaks. They all have one thing 
in common: they all rely on the forest setting, or 
habitat, for food, water, shelter, and space.

Some animals and plants are adapted to very narrow 
ranges of conditions in which they are able to live. 
These animals are called specialists. The Canada 
lynx, for instance, needs large tracts of relatively 
undeveloped forests for hunting. If roads or devel-
opment fragment a forest, the reclusive lynx may not 
be able to roam through all of its territory, limiting 
its ability to access food, water, shelter, or a mate.

About 75 percent of the diet of Canada lynxes is 
snowshoe hares. Both live in forests.

Raccoons eat a range of different foods and therefore 
can live in a wide range of areas.

FOREST ECOSYSTEMS

Other forest inhabitants, called generalists, thrive 
in a wide range of habitat types. One such creature 
is the highly adaptable raccoon, which is as much 
at home lunching in an urban trash can as it is in 
foraging for frogs, ants, fruit, nuts, and fish in a 
northern stream.

Animal Populations
The number and diversity of animal species depends 
on the amount of available food, predators, access to 
clean water, and ability to adapt to changes in food, 
water, shelter, or space. Some animals such as deer, 
moose, rabbits, and insects use a broad number of 
plant species. For example, insects such as mosquitoes 
feed on a broad range of animals, so removing 
one species of mammal wont affect the mosquito 
population. Other animals (like the Canada lynx) 
subsist only on a narrow range of food sources (like 
hares). If predators like Canada lynxes are reduced 
because of over-hunting, over-trapping, or human 
development, then the population of hares may rise, 
along with a rise in damage to trees and plants from 
browsing. In the same way, monarch caterpillars 
feed almost exclusively on milkweed plants; if 
milkweeds are removed, so too go the caterpillars.

If confined to too-small habitats, animals (wild 
or domestic) can overgraze tasty trees and plants 
and limit those plants ability to regenerate. 
Consequently, thorny and less nutritious plants such 
as the black locust tree and burdock may increase 
in number. Plants that tend to increase when grazing 
rises are called increasers. Plants that tend to decrease 
as grazing increases are called decreasers. While many 
consider increasers weeds, some increasers do pro-
vide benefits. For example, goldfinches prefer to live 
and nest near large populations of prickly thistles, a 
plant that increases with grazing and disturbance. 

Trout, which prefer clean, cool streams, depend on 
large, mature trees to shade and cool the water and 
the gravel streambeds trout lay their eggs in. Trout 
rely on roots from plants and trees to hold soil in 
place, preventing streams from filling with silt.

Finally, insects can cause environmental changes. 
Invasive gypsy moth caterpillars defoliate and 
weaken certain species of trees, which can change 
the composition of the forest. Invasive emerald ash 
borer beetles bore through bark and kill forests of 
closely growing ash trees.

Different types of forestand even different parts 
of the same forestprovide different necessities. 
The forest floor is by far the busiest part of the 
forest, with more kinds of plants and animals than 
any other part of the forest. Animal and plant life 
is usually most varied where the habitat is most 
diverse. Some of the richest habitat, for instance, 
occurs between areas of different types of forests 
and at forest edges where trees and open areas meet.

Forest Succession
Plant communities change depending on their 
environmental conditions. As environmental con-
ditions change, the types of plants that make up 
the community may also change. This process is 
called succession. In a stable community, plants are 
well suited to the amount of water, nutrients, and 
sunlight available to them. As the availability of 
resources changes,  conditions may favor a different 
set of plants, and these plants will become more 

abundant. This causes a shift in the makeup of the 
plant community. In effect, the new plants succeed 
the old, creating a slightly different community. 

Environmental conditions that trigger succession 
may include any natural or human-caused distur-
bance that reduces the number of living trees from 
an area. Some examples are: timber harvesting, 
urbanization, farming, fire, and windstorms.
Example 1: From Farm to Forest
A forest growing on abandoned farmland that was 
once a maplebasswood forest is a good example 
of succession. After the farmers leave the area, 
the cleared spaces become friendly terrain for 
 sun-loving, hardy pioneer species such as grasses, 
ragweed, and other nonwoody plants. As pioneer 
species grow and thrive, they often create conditions 
that favor a second set of plants and animals called 
intermediate species. Seeds drifting in from trees that 
do well in full sun, such as box elder, ash, aspen, 

  forest succession: as forests change, so do the number and types of animals that live in them

A disturbance at any of these stages pushes the forest to an earlier stage. Despite periods of stability, forest 
communities move from one successional stage to another. Throughout history, woodlands have woven their way 
through many cycles of growth, death, and regeneration urged on by ice, fire, disease, and other disruptions.

and cherry, may repopulate the area. As these trees 
mature, they shade the forest floor, making it difficult 
for their own seeds to grow. Shade-loving species 
such as maple and basswood find themselves at a 
competitive advantage, and the species composition 
of the forest slowly shifts. Over time, the older, sun-
loving trees die out and the shade-tolerant species 
take over, creating a climax community dominated by 
plants and animals that prefer these conditions. Left 
undisturbed, the initial climax trees will eventually 
die, and the forest will evolve into a more stable plant 
community dominated by maple and basswood until 
the next disturbance. And the cycle goes on.

Example 2: From Fire to Forest
Fire can also trigger succession. The charred land 
becomes friendly terrain for the first pioneers
grasses and other nonwoody plants. Raspberry and 
other shade-intolerant intermediate species such as 
aspen, paper birch, and jack pine follow. Some of

FOREST ECOSYSTEMS

these trees have special adaptations that make it 
 possible for them move into a new clearing. Aspen, 
for instance, can grow on relatively poor soil and 
use their root-sprouting capabilities to recolonize 
a burned forest in a matter of a few years. Jack 
pine cones are serotinous, meaning that the seeds 
stay trapped within the cones until released by heat 
(120F/49C or higher). When a fire burns through 
an area littered with these cones, they open, scat-
tering seeds on the land. As intermediate species 
mature, other, more shade-tolerant specieswhite 
pine, balsam fir, white spruce, and the likethen 
find themselves at a competitive advantage, and the 
species composition of the forest slowly shifts. As 
the older shade-intolerant trees die out, their more 
shade-tolerant successors take over, until the next 
disturbance. And the cycle goes on.

Native Plant 
Communities
Because certain trees have similar requirements for 
light, water, temperature, soil type, and the like, trees 
tend to appear in predictable combinations. For 
example, conditions that favor sugar maples also 
favor the American basswood, so where you find 
one, youll likely find the other, along with other 
plants that thrive in those conditions. Such groups 
of plants that have evolved and adapted in an area 
together are called native plant communities. Native 
plant communities interact naturally with each other 
and with their environment and do not contain 
introduced, or nonnative, plants and communities.

Within native plant communities, forests are named 
according to the conditions and dominant plants 
found in that community. There are more than 
50 native plant communities in Minnesota. The 
 following table lists some examples of native plant 
community names and places they can be viewed.

Chapter Two: Forest Ecosystems

 

 

 

 

 

 

  Forests are complex ecosystems that 

support a range of plants and animals. 

  Forests are made up of several layers.

  The kinds of animals in a forest are related 

to the kinds of plants in the forest, plus 
other factors such as climate, soils, and 
landforms.

  Forests are always changing due to 

disturbances, which may be natural or 
human-caused.

  When forests change, so do the number 
and types of plants and animals in them.

  Minnesota forests face threats from invasive 

plants and animals.
