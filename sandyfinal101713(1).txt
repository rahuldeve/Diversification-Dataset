Economic Impact of Hurricane Sandy
Potential Economic Activity Lost and Gained in New Jersey and New York

Executive Summary
Hurricane/Post Tropical Strom Sandy struck the New Jersey coast on October 29, 2012,
inflicting billions of dollars of damage to residential and commercial facilities as well as
transportation and other infrastructure along the coastline and well into the interior of the
states impacted. This report examines potential long-term economic effects of Hurricane
Sandy, in terms of losses and gains in economic activity, in New Jersey and the 13 counties in
lower New York that were declared as disaster areas by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). This report does not focus on the economic damage directly inflicted by the
storm. Instead, this report aims to measure the impact of disruption of economic activity
caused by the storm. This impact may be negative (anticipated spending losses in Travel and
Tourism in New Jersey), or positive (the potential for increased economic activity from
reconstruction projects in New Jersey and New York).
Our measurement of the economic disruptions inflicted on New Jersey and New York by
Hurricane Sandy assumes that most businesses faced only short term business disruptions, with
the only exception being the Travel and Tourism industry in New Jersey. New Jersey’s Travel
and Tourism industry is expected to sustain measurable declines, primarily during the third
quarter of 2013. Finally, we assume that New Jersey and New York1 will receive the full amount
of the money they estimated to repair and replace damage from the storm. We also assume a
time period of four (4) years for completion of the repairs and reconstruction—i.e., through the
end of 2016. (See box on next page.)
The assumption that most business impacts were primarily short-term is based on our review of
reports, short papers, newspaper articles and discussions with members from FEMA’s Joint
Field Office (with Federal, state and local members) located in Newark, NJ, that was set up to
deal with the crisis. Our assumption that Travel and Tourism impacts in New York were shortterm came from various reports and sources, particularly New York Travel Bureaus. Our
estimate of impacts to New Jersey Travel and Tourism in 2013 is based on a Rutgers University
1

This analysis focuses on the effects to New Jersey and certain lower New York counties only, although 12 states
and the District of Columbia had counties declared by FEMA as disaster areas from Hurricane Sandy (See footnote
43 for the other states.) As of July 2013, disaster relief funding for these two states accounted for 96 percent of
Federal budget obligations for Sandy relief (eligible recipients having legal recourse if the obligation is not fulfilled.)

forecast of spending losses in this sector during the third quarter of 2013. Finally, our estimates
of impacts on construction in these two states are based on what each state estimated to be
the cost to completely recover from damage resulting from the storm. These estimates were
provided to the U.S. Congress for its deliberations that led to the Disaster Relief Appropriations
Act, 2013.
The findings of this analysis are based entirely on estimated Travel and Tourism spending losses
in New Jersey and projected new construction spending occurring over a four (4) year period in
New Jersey and lower New York. The inter-industry relationships in these estimates are based
on regional multipliers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Regional Input-Output
Modeling System (RIMS II). See the Appendix for a detailed description of methods and data
used to make these estimates.
The results presented below assume that reconstruction spending equals damage estimates
provided by New Jersey and New York. These output and jobs estimates are directly
proportional to the levels received and spent by these states. Actual spending may vary.
Therefore, output and jobs estimates would vary proportionally.

Based on these assumptions and timeline, we find that:




An estimated loss of $950 million in tourism spending in New Jersey in 2013 will reduce
total output in New Jersey by $1.2 billion this year and reduce employment by over
11,000 workers primarily in the Accommodations, Food Services, Retail, Amusements
and Performing Arts and the Transportation Services sectors. These losses are expected
to occur in the third quarter of 2013 and would be concentrated in two counties—
Ocean and Monmouth.
The New Jersey state government estimated construction costs of $29.5 billion to repair
and replace the damage caused by the storm. If all of this money is spent on rebuilding,
the influx of new spending will result in $44 billion in total output and about 281,000
new jobs (full-time and part-time2). Thus, the net gain in jobs in New Jersey over the
four year period would be 270,000 (281,000 construction-related jobs less 11,000 Travel
and Tourism-related jobs). Of the 281,000 construction-related jobs, about 218,000 will
be direct construction jobs.
o If all of the projected new construction spending in New Jersey is spread over
four (4) years, the average annual number of jobs supported by this spending
would be about 70,000.

2

A full-time job would be associated with a 40-hour work week or about 2,000 hours per year. A part-time job
could be a job with as little as one hour worked in a week.

As of July 2013, however, approximately $5.5 billion in Federal aid had been authorized
for projects in New Jersey.3 In addition to Federal aid, insurance claim payments will
reach the state. Private insurers are expected to issue $6.3 billion in settled claims in
New Jersey.
Despite temporary business disruptions during the immediate aftermath of Hurricane
Sandy, we did not find evidence of long-term losses in Travel and Tourism spending in
New York resulting from the storm. Nor did we find evidence of long-term spending
losses in any other industries.
The New York state government estimated construction costs of $41.9 billion to repair
and replace the damage caused by the storm in lower New York. If all of this money is
spent on reconstruction, the influx of new spending will generate $53.1 billion in new
total output in those 13 counties and about 352,000 new jobs. About 299,000 jobs will
be construction jobs.
o If all of the projected new construction spending in New York is spread over a
four (4) year period, the average annual number of jobs supported by this
spending would be about 88,000 per year.
o As of July 2013, however, about $7.8 billion in Federal aid has been authorized
for lower New York. Private insurers are expected to issue about $9.6 billion in
insurance payments.

3

On January 29, 2013, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, a $50.7 billion package of assistance largely
focused on Hurricane Disaster Relief, was enacted. The Act provided budget authority to Federal Departments and
Agencies for use in Sandy relief. Each Agency then has to “authorize” the release of these monies for specific
projects in the affected states. An authorization, however, does not necessarily mean that Federal money has
been dispersed.

Introduction and Purpose
This report examines economic impacts to New Jersey and the 13 FEMA-declared disaster
counties in New York which bore the brunt of the damage wrought by Hurricane/Post Tropical
Storm Sandy.4 The economic impact story of Sandy is immediate, devastating damage primarily
to residences, but also to structures and equipment that support industrial production of both
goods and services. This report does not summarize those damages. The purpose of this
analysis is to estimate the ultimate change in economic activity, such as industry production
and employment, resulting from both the large one-time losses in tourism spending in New
Jersey and the potential gains in construction spending in both New Jersey and the 13 counties
in New York resulting from the storm.
Figure 1 shows all the counties in New Jersey. Each county in New Jersey was declared by
FEMA as being eligible for Federal disaster relief. Figure 2 shows the 13 counties in New York
declared by FEMA as eligible. Both maps provide highest and lowest counties in terms of
unemployment rates and median income.5
This report begins with a discussion of the business impact of Hurricane Sandy and includes an
industry-by-industry summary of reports of disruptions to economic activity in the immediate
aftermath of the storm. Following this general industry discussion is a more specific estimate of
the impacts of anticipated spending losses in New Jersey for the 2013 tourist season. This
portion of the report provides a description of which industries compose the Travel and
Tourism industry and the impact to industry output and jobs that these spending losses will
likely generate. Industry impacts were estimated not only for the industries that compose the
Travel and Tourism sector, but also impacts to the supplying industries (the indirect) as well as
impacts to household spending (the induced). The next section of this report discusses
anticipated construction spending in New Jersey and New York and the direct and indirect
industry impacts this spending is likely to generate. Our analysis did not include estimates of
induced effects for new construction spending because (1) we wanted to provide conservative
estimates of output and jobs and (2) since we assume that some of the construction workers
live outside of the affected areas, the increase in spending resulting from their incomes would
not remain in the affected areas. The conclusion of this paper highlights the net positive effects
of Hurricane Sandy in terms of gains in construction jobs from rebuilding. However, the size of

The analysis in this report could also be done in much greater geographical and industrial detail if the data
become available. The areas of analysis could include economic-related regions or municipalities (such as the
southern Jersey shore counties) or even individual counties. The detail needed to perform the analysis would
include, for each of these areas, (1) long-term dollar value loss of economic activity by industry and (2) reconstruction dollars spent or planned.

the positive effects will depend on the amount of construction spending that ultimately occurs
in these two states.6 Finally, the Appendix describes the data and the methods, including the
model used, to reach these conclusions.

For example, a workforce training initiative in New Jersey called the Recovery Talent Network was designed to
establish a New Jersey workforce focused on the recovery.

Business Impact of Hurricane Sandy
Despite the damage to business structures and equipment and business interruptions,
particularly from electrical power outages and the inability of workers to commute, a number
of economic indicators suggest that disruptions to industry production in the affected areas
were short-lived. Changes in unemployment claims, payroll employment and industrial
production suggest that economic activity almost fully resumed within a couple of months after
the storm.
Liberty Street Economics7 examined new claims for unemployment insurance in New Jersey and
New York before, during, and after the storm. New claims for unemployment insurance,
reported weekly, averaged 35,000 in New York and New Jersey combined prior to Sandy (Figure
3). In the first full week of November, they increased above 100,000 and remained elevated for
another two to three weeks. After four weeks, unemployment claims dropped back to prestorm levels.

According to payroll employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the majority of
the jobs lost in the New York–New Jersey area were located in the New York City metropolitan
area (which includes storm-affected areas in New York City, Long Island and northern New
Jersey.) The New York City metro area lost 32,000 jobs during the second full week of
November. Although the number of jobs lost is much lower than the surge in jobless claims in
the region, Liberty Street Economics reasoned that after filing unemployment claims, workers
may have become re-employed by the time of the payroll survey. Additionally, self-employed
workers that became eligible for disaster unemployment assistance (a portion of the jobless
claims numbers), but did not show up in the unemployed data because they are not included in
the BLS payroll survey. These reasons, plus new jobs from rebuilding and clean-up efforts,
would explain the discrepancy.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) reported that Hurricane Sandy held down production in the
Northeast region late October and early November 2012, especially in the following sectors:
utilities, chemicals, food, transportation equipment and computers and electronic products.
Industrial output quickly rebounded in November, which the Fed primarily attributed to a
recovery in production from industries damaged by the storm.8
These three economic indicators—unemployment claims, payroll employment data, and
industrial production reports of the Fed—pointed to a short-term disruption in economic
activity.

Industries Affected by Hurricane Sandy
This impact analysis is based on long-term industry disruptions as a result of the storm—
primarily in Travel and Tourism and Construction. However, according to a number of separate
reports, a broad range of industries were affected:
 Manufacturing firms represented a sizable portion of the overall number of businesses that
were forced to close due to the storm. An estimated 10,000 separate manufacturing
facilities were directly affected by Sandy.9 Industrial companies most severely affected faced
repairing structural damage, draining flood water, removing debris and waiting for power,
phone and Internet restoration, etc. Such delays on the industrial supply chain could have
affected productivity of distributors and storage facilities far away from the damaged areas.
The period of time that the facilities lost production varied, and once back on-line

production more or less made up for the forced downtime. We found no reports of longterm disruptions that affected an entire manufacturing industry.10
The Gaming industry (Atlantic City casinos) lost an estimated $5 million per day in revenue
because of closures from Sandy. Even though most casinos and restaurants sustained
minimal damage, tourist traffic continued to suffer as media reports incorrectly conveyed
that the Atlantic City boardwalk had washed away.11
An estimated 20 percent of the Commercial trucking industry was stalled in the week after
the storm with losses of $140 million per day (as estimated by FTR consulting). 12 However,
the American Trucking Association reported that reductions in freight tonnage in October
immediately recovered in November and that the industry would benefit as demand for
freight trucking services increase with Sandy-related rebuilding.13
Auto industry demand increased in late 2012 as consumers sought to replace tens of
thousands of cars that were totaled because of area flooding. This increase in demand right
after the storm quickly settled back to pre-Sandy levels.14
New Jersey and New York both have significant Commercial and recreational fishing
industries that support coastal communities and contribute to each state’s economy.15 The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducted a 60-day assessment
of the impact of Hurricane Sandy on fishing communities in New York and New Jersey and
concluded that both these states incurred sizable commercial and recreational fishingrelated losses. For both commercial and recreational fisherman, the boats and equipment
are insured. However, the loss of economic activity (the fishing catch) is not. Most of the
losses were to seafood processors. Losses were as high as $105 million in recreational
fishing and almost $14 million to the commercial fishing sector in New Jersey. In New York,
damages to the recreational fishing sector totaled $58 million while damages to the
commercial fishing sector totaled $19 million, according to NOAA’s estimates.16 Despite
these losses, it was determined by NOAA’s survey results that these industries did not suffer

Although disruptions were primarily short-term, these impacts can have long-term impacts on smaller
businesses in the supply chain where such firms would take a longer time to recover.

3,000 jobs in New York. (NOAA, pp. 1 and 2)

long-term disruptions to economic activity. NOAA reports that in the week immediately
following the storm, all fishing sectors in New Jersey were operating at less than 20 percent
of their normal schedule but conditions steadily improved over the four-week period for
most sectors. In New York, seafood processors and dealers reported operating at over 80
percent of their usual schedules by the fourth week, but some for-hire operations and
commercial fishing vessels were operating at less than 40 percent. Most seafood
processing businesses lost income during this period because of reduced schedules;
however, the disruptions were not long enough to affect their revenue expectations for
2013.
According to the Insurance Information Institute, the domestic Insurance industry remains
solid financially despite Hurricane Sandy and other natural disasters that occurred in 2012.
The total payout by the insurance industry is expected to be reduced because much of the
storm damage was caused by the storm surge and subsequent flooding which is not covered
by standard homeowner or small business commercial policies. Also, reportedly half of all
losses of the insurance industry are expected to be covered by reinsurers.17 The III
estimates that insurers will pay $18.75 to $25 billion to over 1.5 million policyholders across
15 States and the District of Columbia.18 Payments will be concentrated in New York ($9.6
billion) and New Jersey ($6.3 billion).19 The majority of claims will come from homeowners
(71%), but the highest value of claims will be from commercial property owners ($9 billion)
and will account for almost half of the value of claims paid.

In New Jersey alone, nearly 19,000 small businesses20 sustained damage of $250,000 or more
with total business losses estimated at $8.3 billion as a result of Hurricane Sandy,21 about 1.0
percent of New Jersey Gross State Product in 2012. A survey of small businesses in New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut was conducted by Hartford insurers which found that while many

small businesses were forced to close in the immediate aftermath of the storm, over 80 percent
were closed for two weeks or less.22
Thus, Hurricane Sandy had significant, although short-term, economic impacts on a wide variety
of industries. In our analysis, we are assuming that these short-term impacts to revenue will be
made up after the storm. The exception is that New Jersey will have revenue losses in the
Travel and Tourism industry that the state is not likely to recover.23 On the other hand,
Hurricane Sandy will serve as a stimulant to these states’ economies if spending plans are
achieved and strategically implemented, using local firms and workforce.

Impact of Hurricane Sandy on New Jersey
Travel and Tourism24
The Travel and Tourism industry is a significant driver of growth in the New Jersey economy,
generating almost $38 billion in tourism sales in 2012 and surpassing its pre-recession peak.25
Governor Christie and others have reported that New Jersey tourism increased in 2012 despite
Sandy. However, mild weather in 2012 and increased demand for accommodations after Sandy
by residents, repair crews and others involved in the Sandy recovery helped to boost tourism
during a normally slow period. The true impact of Sandy on New Jersey Travel and Tourism and
related industries will depend on how quickly damage is repaired and how many tourists and
seasonal residents return during the 2013 summer travel season.
According to Tourism Economics, before Hurricane Sandy, in 2012 the New Jersey tourism
industry directly and indirectly supported more than 500,000 jobs. Tourism Economics also
estimated that the Travel and Tourism industry contributed $34.7 billion or 7.0 percent to the
entire state economy and generated $4.5 billion in state and local tax revenues. In the
aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, over two million households in the state lost power and 346,000
homes were damaged or destroyed. New Jersey’s major tourist destination, Atlantic City, saw

The commercial fisheries industry may have sustained long-term disruptions, as damaged vessels would need to
be repaired or replaced before business could resume, but no data are currently available to support that
conclusion. NOAA plans to conduct a one-year assessment of the social and economic impact s of Hurricane Sandy
on New Jersey and New York commercial and recreational fisheries, which may yield relevant data.
24
The Travel and Tourism industry includes parts of several industries including accommodations, recreation, air
and other transportation, food and beverages and retail trade.

the closure of casinos for several days, which led to a 28 percent drop in revenue during the
month of November—the biggest monthly drop in 34 years. Tourist destinations along the
Jersey Shore saw immense damage to businesses and rental properties.
The entire state of New Jersey was declared a disaster area after Hurricane Sandy; however
some areas sustained less damage than others and recovered more quickly. The Atlantic City
Casinos reopened within a week and the southern shore counties received minimal damage.
Some hotels had high occupancy in the aftermath of the storm (which is normally a slow
period) because of FEMA occupants and displaced residents. However, a comprehensive
analysis of the macroeconomic and fiscal impacts of Hurricane Sandy on the New Jersey
economy conducted by Rutgers University revealed that spending losses to Travel and Tourism
in some areas of the state could be long-term, particularly during the 2013 tourist season in
July, August and September.
The Rutgers analysis estimated the impacts of Hurricane Sandy, both negative and positive, on
New Jersey’s Gross State Product, employment, income and state tax revenues through 2015. 26
The study did not estimate the impacts to individual industries but did incorporate assumptions
of losses to the Travel and Tourism industry in New Jersey. Rutgers estimated that New Jersey’s
tourism industry will have losses of $950 million by the third quarter of 2013 as a result of
Hurricane Sandy. This estimate of the $950 million spending loss is based on a forecast of
tourism spending in New Jersey in 2013 if there were no storm. Based on the pre-storm
forecast for 2013 of $38 billion for Travel and Tourism in New Jersey, the $950 million in
spending loss would lower the forecast to $37 billion. Rutgers expects most of the spending
declines to occur in Monmouth and Ocean counties in the third quarter of 2013. Given the
comprehensive nature of their study and our discussion with one of the authors, we use the
assumption of Travel and Tourism industry spending losses of $950 million for our impact
analysis.
As shown in Figure 4, in the upper Jersey shore including the counties of Ocean, Monmouth,
Middlesex and Somerset, there was an actual employment increase of 2.4 percent in the
combined sectors of Accommodations and Food Services (which account for roughly 60 percent
of Travel and Tourism industries), between July of 2012 and July of 2013. In the lower Jersey
shore, including Atlantic and Cape May counties, there were declines in these sectors, 3.4 and
1.2 percent respectively during this period. Thus, preliminary July 2013 data show that the net
change in jobs in Accommodations and Food Services throughout these areas was negligible
across the entire Jersey shore.

Travel and Tourism Industry Impacts
This impact analysis uses BEA’s RIMS II multipliers to estimate the direct and indirect effects of
a decline in Travel and Tourism spending caused by Hurricane Sandy. We used the estimated
$950 million tourism spending loss from Rutgers and also assumed that included in the $950
million are the induced impacts (loss of household spending).27 This total expected decline in
tourism spending was then allocated among travel and tourism categories according to the
Tourism Economics estimates and BEA’s Travel and Tourism Satellite accounts.28 Retail trade
categories were adjusted to reflect the value added by retailers; i.e., we assume that the
27

We assumed this for two reasons: (1) there was no indication that induced impacts were not already included in
the Rutgers University report and (2) our goal to preclude double-counting of induced impacts and negating our
desire to arrive at conservative estimates.

Economics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis for retail trade value added adjustments.

After adjusting for retail margins, the net decrease in local purchases (that is, within the state of
New Jersey) from Sandy is estimated to be $828.6 million. Accommodations (hotels and
lodging) and Food Services and Drinking places were most affected, with an estimated decline
of $287.2 and $217 million, respectively. These two industries account for over 60 percent of
Travel and Tourism losses in New Jersey. Purchases of recreational services that will not occur
are estimated at $106.5 million or approximately 13 percent of the decline in tourism spending.
Spending on Air and other transportation services will decline by over $170 million. Tourist
spending on retail items including groceries, apparel and gasoline will decline by less than $47
million, a small share of the total.

29

Only retail is adjusted in this way since the multipliers for all the other service sectors such as Accommodations
and Food services have multipliers that already take into account the likely economic activity in the area (New
Jersey) to produce their intermediate inputs. For example, the multiplier for Food services includes the likely
economic activity in New Jersey to produce the groceries and beverages served in eating and drinking places.

Page | 11

RIMS II Type I30 multipliers for the state of New Jersey were applied to the expected tourism
spending losses to estimate loss in total output and employment across the region. The total
loss in New Jersey tourism industry output from the initial decline in tourism spending ($828.6
million) will exceed $1.2 billion when impacts throughout the region are incorporated. (Table 2)

The majority of declines will occur in the Accommodations ($444.5 million) and Food and
Drinking places sectors ($318.7 million). Thus, a decline in direct spending of $287 million on
Accommodations will result in a total decline in output of $444.5 million as the industry spends
less on intermediate purchases from supplier industries. For example, the Accommodations
sector is composed of hotels, motels, bed and breakfast rentals and rental vacation homes. A
reduction in their revenue will result in lower purchases by this sector for energy products such
as electricity and other fuel products, food for consumption supplied by the facility, repair
services, linen services and so on. Thus, the revenue loss will affect many industries in the
area.31

30

Type I multipliers are used to estimate direct and indirect effects. Type II multipliers are used to estimate direct,
indirect and induced (household) impacts. Type I multipliers were used in this case for two reasons: we already
assumed that the induced spending losses were part of the $950 million loss estimate from Rutgers and a desire
to be conservative in our output and job loss estimates.
31
In this example, additional lost revenue impacts (the induced effects) are assumed to be negligible since we
already include an estimate of impacts on the retail sector in the table above.

Page | 12

Total direct, indirect and induced job losses in the New Jersey Travel and Tourism sector as a
result of Hurricane Sandy are estimated at 11,287.32 The majority of job losses will be in
Accommodations (3,039) and Food and drinking places (3,898). Although over a third of the
total job losses are in Food and drinking places, it has only about one-quarter of the total loss in
output (a measure of revenue) indicating that this sector is particularly labor intensive and may
employ relatively more part-time workers. Similarly, job losses in the Amusements, gambling
and recreation industry is larger than its proportional loss in output—1,151 fewer jobs is more
than 10 percent of the total job losses, while it accounts for less than 6 percent of the total
output decline.
Further impacts of a decline in New Jersey Travel and Tourism spending can be seen across a
variety of other industries (Table 3). Employment losses that appear to be concentrated in
Travel and Tourism sectors in Table 2 include losses from several other industries that provide
intermediate goods and services. The Accommodations industry according to Table 3 will suffer
a loss of 2,114 jobs, but Table 2 shows a total direct and indirect loss of 3,039 jobs. Thus, the
loss of just over two-thousand jobs in the Accommodations industry will result in an additional
925 jobs lost in other industries that support that sector. Non-travel and tourism industries
(the indirect industries) expected to see job losses as a result of lower Travel and Tourism
spending include Administrative and waste management services (438 jobs), Professional and
technical services (298 jobs) and Real estate and rental leasing (179 jobs).
The RIMS II impact analysis finds that, although devastating, Hurricane Sandy on average has
had a minor impact on New Jersey Travel and Tourism-related output and employment. A $1.2
billion loss due to the storm amounts to a potential dollar loss of perhaps 3 percent of annual
tourism sales of almost $40 billion. A potential loss of 11,287 full-time and part-time jobs is
slightly more than 2 percent of total tourism industry jobs of over 500,000.33 This represented
0.4 percent of total state employment in 2012. The Rutgers study suggests that the majority of
losses will occur in two counties, Ocean and Monmouth. While this analysis did not examine
county by county multipliers, we expect the share of the loss in output and jobs to be
proportionately larger in these two counties.
Discussions with local tourism representatives provided some insight into the prospects for
recovery of tourism demand. According to New Jersey tourism representatives, shore counties
with large rental markets continue to be adversely affected because thousands of homes
remain uninhabitable and rebuilding has been slow as residents await finalization of FEMA
32

The total includes both full-time and part-time jobs.
Tourism Economics estimate of 500,000 jobs includes workers in industries that indirectly support Travel and
Tourism as well as jobs “induced” by spending of income earned by these workers.

flood plains for the area.34 They have also observed that since 2007, tourists have become
more bargain-conscious and adjust the length of stay based on economic factors. Some New
Jersey counties have experienced the loss of major corporate employers and military
installations that have affected their local economies. Thus, it may be difficult to separate the
impact of Hurricane Sandy on tourism demand from an overall economic decline in some New
Jersey tourist areas.

The New Jersey tourism officials agree that a primary factor behind a successful tourism season
is successive periods of good weather, especially at beach destinations. The state’s aggressive
advertising campaign, including displacing misperceptions of damage to the Jersey shore, and
perhaps a stretch of mild, sunny weather will help mitigate tourism losses expected because of
Hurricane Sandy.

34

Just as happened after Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast states, New Jersey shoreline construction permits may
include new construction guidelines because of the storm.

Impact of Hurricane Sandy on
Travel and Tourism in New York City and Long Island
New York City and Long Island were hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Electricity outages, flooding,
and property damages were widespread. Lower Manhattan and the Rockaways were
particularly devastated. Large numbers of houses and other structures were destroyed in Long
Island.
Travel and Tourism is a major industry in New York City and in Long Island. According to
Tourism Economics, in 2012, tourism generated $37 billion of sales in New York City and
supported 360,599 jobs or 9.7 percent of all employment in New York City.35 Tourism
Economics indicate that Travel and Tourism is a $5.1 billion industry in Long Island, employing
74,128 people or 6.2 percent of all employment in Long Island.36
Tourism in New York City took a direct hit from the storm. Almost 100 hotels were affected by
flooding and power outages for at least 2-3 days. The New York City subway system suffered
the most severe flooding in 100 years. Airports, tunnels, and other transportation facilities took
more than two weeks to return to normal. Gas rationing in the New York-New Jersey area also
affected the number of visitors to New York City.
Despite the severe impact of Hurricane Sandy, tourism in New York City recovered quickly.
Initially, hotel bookings dropped due to the storm but bounced back in the week following the
storm.37 The Travel and Tourism industry of New York City actually did quite well as a whole in
2012. Spending by visitors to New York City increased 7.3 percent above 2011 totals.38 New
York City’s Travel and Tourism industry recovered quickly from the effects of Sandy in part
because many of the activities for tourists take place indoors, i.e., at theaters, restaurants, and
museums. According to an official at NYC & Company, the official marketing, tourism, and
partnership organization for the City of New York, New York City made up most of its short
term losses in tourism by June. A recent media report39 also indicated that the damages at
Rockaway Beach, which was devastated by the storm, had mostly been repaired. The Statue of

Liberty, which was exposed to the storm, re-opened on July 4th after the structures on its
surrounding grounds had been repaired.
As indicated earlier, there were significant property damages in Long Island by Sandy.
However, the damages occurred mostly in residential areas. A lot of houses were damaged, but
these houses were not typically rental units used by tourists. There were also damages to the
beaches. For example, some sand dunes in the Hamptons were washed away. Since the sand
dunes were there to protect the beaches and nearby properties, the destruction of the sand
dunes did not directly affect tourism significantly. Furthermore, Hurricane Sandy hit Long
Island in late October, which was a low season for tourism. According to a beach-by-beach
survey conducted by the Long Island Convention & Visitors Bureau and Sports Commission
shortly before Memorial Day, all state beaches in Long Island were ready to open to tourists by
Memorial Day. According to one of these officials, Hurricane Sandy has not had much impact
on Long Island tourism. In 2012, tourism spending in Long Island increased 6.3 percent.40

Impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Construction Industry
Cost of Rebuilding
Rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy is and will continue to be costly for the states of New York and
New Jersey, private insurance companies as well as the Federal government. New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie estimated $36.9 billion for its repair and recovery from the storm (Table
4).41 Similarly, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo estimated nearly $42 billion for its repair and
recovery from the storm (Table 5).42 Under the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, Congress
authorized $50.5 billion in January 2013 in supplemental disaster funding for twelve states and
the District of Columbia affected by the storm.43

Eleven months after the storm hit, only a small share of the Federal money in the Disaster
Relief Act--$5.5 billion in New Jersey and $7.8 billion in New York--has been authorized to be
allocated to the states, with a significant share of the Federal dollars in New Jersey and over
half of the funds in New York in the form of approved loans and grants. (Table 6) In New Jersey,
around $3.5 billion of the total assistance is in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
payments made on claims, with the rest coming from grants and loans approved for individuals,
households, renters, homeowners, and businesses.44 In New York, around $3.7 billion of the
total assistance is in NFIP payments that have been made to policy holders.45 Almost $1 billion
is in FEMA assistance grants approved for individuals and households. Another $1.5 billion has
been approved for SBA disaster loans and $1.6 billion to FEMA Public Assistance grants to local,
state, and tribal governments and eligible non-profits.
In addition to the Federal disaster relief funds, the Insurance Information Institute reports that
private insurers are expected to issue $6.3 billion in settled claims in New Jersey and $9.6
billion in New York. As of April 2013, over 90 percent of private insurance claims in New Jersey
and New York have been settled.46

Construction in New Jersey and New York
The New Jersey construction industry saw relatively steady growth in the months after
Hurricane Sandy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the construction
industry grew by 3.8 percent, adding 4,500 jobs between November 2012 and June
2013. Construction employment has also increased in New York (statewide, including those
areas not affected) since the end of the storm. Construction employment grew by 4.7 percent,
adding 14,100 jobs from November 2012 to June 2013.
BLS’ Current Employment Statistics data provide a regional breakdown of employment changes
in the Mining, Logging, and Construction Supersector in metropolitan areas within New
Jersey.47 (Figure 5) As the map shows, the Atlantic City-Hammonton MSA had the greatest

Data on Construction Industry jobs alone were not available in all areas, but in the areas where data were
available, construction jobs accounted for all jobs.

Page | 19

increase in mining, logging, and construction jobs from July 2012 to July 2013, about 26
percent, but the number of jobs increased from a relatively small level of 4,300 in July 2012.48
On the other hand, the Edison-New Brunswick MSA showed a decline of 2.7 percent over the
same time period over a much larger initial construction employment level, 37,700 mining,
logging, and construction workers in July 2013. Taken all together, the metropolitan areas in
New Jersey had an increase of 4,100 mining, logging, and construction jobs from July 2012 to
July 2013, somewhat consistent with the seasonally adjusted data of a 4,500 job increase from
November 2012 through June 2013.

Figure 6 shows the number of mining, logging, and construction jobs and annual percentage
growth in the New York metropolitan areas that were affected by the storm. In the hardest hit
areas of Long Island (the Nassau-Suffolk Metropolitan Division) and New York City, mining,

logging, and construction jobs grew by 6.4 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. The PutnamRockland-Westchester metropolitan division also showed an increase of 2.7 percent. Taken all
together, the metropolitan divisions in New York affected by the storm showed an increase in
construction jobs of 9,200.

Construction Industry Impacts
In order to consider the economic impacts to the region from the rebuilding of New Jersey and
New York structures and infrastructure, we use BEA’s RIMS II multipliers (as we did for the New
Jersey Travel and Tourism, page 9) and we assume that all of the money that each of the states
estimated to cover the costs of repair and replacement will eventually be spent. Therefore, we
consider the economic impacts of an extra $29.5 billion in New Jersey and $41.9 billion in New
York spent by the construction industry.
In New Jersey, new construction spending of $29.5 billion would lead to an increase in total
output of $44 billion and an increase of 295,020 jobs required to produce the $44 billion of new
output. However, owing to a prior assumption that many of the Professional and Scientific jobs
related to the reconstruction would be performed by the Federal sector prior to or during the
Federal outlay to New Jersey, we subtracted 12,002 jobs or 90 percent of the Professional and
Page | 21

Scientific jobs that were estimated using the RIMS II employment multiplier. 49 Thus, we
estimate an employment impact to New Jersey of 281,131 jobs. Of these 281,000 new jobs,
218,000 will be construction jobs. The rest are from other industries that support New Jersey’s
reconstruction. (Table 7)

49

We use Type I multipliers (direct and indirect) to estimate construction-related output and employment for two
reasons: (1) to avoid over estimating output and employment from household spending (the induced) occurring
outside the state due to a potential for non-local workers to use their earnings in the region or state where they
live and not in New Jersey and (2) to provide a conservative estimate. Further, we assume that practically all of the
Professional, Scientific and Technical jobs that are estimated using RIMS to support this level of construction
spending would come from the Federal sector, primarily as contracting professionals who specialize in damage
relief, and to, once again, provide a conservative total private sector job estimate.

Page | 22

To determine the impact of the increase in spending to the 13-county region in New York that
was declared eligible for Federal disaster relief. The RIMS II analysis indicates that an increase in
new spending of $41.9 billion in construction spending could lead to an increase in total output
of $53 billion (which includes the $41.9 billion) and new employment of 364,097 jobs. We
make an adjustment to the RIMS analysis as we did for New Jersey and assume that 90 percent
of the Professional and Scientific jobs related to the reconstruction will be made by the Federal
sector. The direct employment impact to the region is an increase of nearly 300,000
construction jobs. The rest are from other industries that support construction. (Table 8)

Net Impact of Hurricane Sandy on Economic Activity
The net economic impact of Hurricane Sandy has been tremendous damage to the capital stock
of both of New Jersey and New York and primarily short-term impacts to business activity
except for the Travel and Tourism industry in New Jersey. The damage from the storm,
however, is likely to lead to rebuilding and repairing that will generate a large number of
construction-related jobs if the cost estimates from both of these states are realized.
 Of the almost 270,000 net gain in jobs in New Jersey (281,000 construction-related jobs less
11,000 Travel and Tourism-related jobs), about 218,000 will be construction jobs. Over a
four-year period, this translates to about 67,500 jobs per year.
 If all of the projected new construction spending in the 13 affected counties in New York is
spread over a four-year period, the average annual number of jobs supported by this
spending would be about 88,000 per year.

Conclusion
Many individuals and businesses are still suffering from the destruction and devastation
inflicted eleven months ago as Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the middle of the Jersey shore.
This economic impact analysis has focused on disruptions in economic activity from Hurricane
Sandy and sought to identify areas with long-term economic losses. We concluded that New
Jersey’s tourism industry would likely see losses but as recovery and restoration spending
occur, particularly in the construction industry, both New Jersey and New York will realize net
job creation. It may seem counterintuitive, but spending from rebuilding after natural disasters
often generates job growth and helps offset initial losses. As noted earlier, the creation of
construction and other jobs reported in this analysis is contingent upon the states of New
Jersey and New York damage estimates; i.e., that spending for reconstruction will equate to the
damage estimates.
President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force developed a Rebuilding Strategy to
serve as a model for communities across the nation facing greater risks from extreme weather
and to continue helping the Sandy-affected region rebuild. The Rebuilding Strategy, delivered
to the President in August 2013, contains 69 policy recommendations, many of which have
already been adopted, that will help homeowners stay in and repair their homes, strengthen
small businesses and revitalize local economies and ensure entire communities are better able
to withstand and recover from future storms.50

declared 13 counties/boroughs in lower New York as eligible for disaster assistance and
multipliers were developed by BEA for these 13 contiguous counties. (See Figures 1 and 2 in
the main body of this report.)
The flow of the analysis was based on the following precepts:
1. Most businesses experienced short-term losses of generating economic activity, i.e.,
production which results in revenues, and short-term losses do not generate sufficient
economic activity loss to assess with the RIMS multipliers;
2. The Travel and Tourism industry in New Jersey is expected to experience significant
economic losses this summer as a result of the storm and will return to normal levels by
2014. Revenue losses, however, are expected to be less than 3 percent of the annual
revenue generated by this industry in 2012;
3. There are no expected significant revenue losses in Travel and Tourism in New York as a
result of the storm;
4. Reconstruction, at the level determined by New Jersey and New York state agencies,
over the next several years as a result of the storm will result in additional output and
employment for the construction industry and its supplying industries. A good share of
construction jobs in New Jersey and New York will be related to rebuilding from the
storm; and

This study is focused on the loss and/or gain of economic activity in New Jersey and New York and not on
damages to their capital stock such as damage and destruction to housing, commercial structures, inventories,
public facilities and infrastructure, which when combined for New Jersey and New York, totaled $71.4 billion.

5. The amount of dollars spent on Sandy-related construction, of course, is directly related
to the actual monies allocated from the Federal sector, private insurance carriers and
state and local governments.
The RIMS II model translates the spending dollar losses and/or gains into lost and/or gained
total output and employment by industry for the duration of the expected spending changes.
The output and employment changes include estimates for both direct industries (Travel and
Tourism and Construction) and indirect industries (supplying industries). Lost Travel and
Tourism spending in New Jersey is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2013. New
spending on construction as a result of the storm in both New Jersey and New York is expected
to occur for several years (we use four years). Although we use a four-year time horizon, the
time period for that construction has not yet been determined.
The model’s multipliers are used in a wide variety of economic impact studies to measure the
ripple effects of spending to include estimates of direct, indirect and induced impacts within a
region. The Bureau of Economic Analysis Users Guide provides several examples.

Travel and Tourism Estimates
We assume that the spending loss in New Jersey in the Travel and Tourism industry will be $950
million in the third quarter of 2013 based on a January 2013 study by Rutgers Edward J.
Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. The distribution of the $950 million to Travel
and Tourism sectors was based on a Tourism Economics52 report for New Jersey and data from
BEA’s Travel and Tourism Satellite accounts. Type I RIMS multipliers were used to determine
output and employment industry impacts. Type II multipliers were not used since we assume
that the household spending losses (the induced) were already incorporated into the $950
million estimated by Rutgers and we did not want to double-count those impacts. Finally,
distribution costs from BEA for retail purchases were used to calculate a “margin” share (or a
value added share of the revenue) estimate for retail purchases by tourists in New Jersey.
Implicit in using the retail margin was the assumption that the retail items were not produced
or wholesaled in New Jersey and truck transportation was from out of state. Of the three retail
items used in this study—groceries, apparel and gasoline—only gasoline possibly could have
been produced within state.

Construction Industry Estimates
Construction impacts were based on the dollar value of construction needed to repair or
replace residential, commercial, public facilities, inventories and infrastructure. These
estimates were prepared by the states of New Jersey ($29.5 billion) and New York ($41.9
billion). Type I multipliers (direct and indirect) were also used to estimate output and job
impacts because (1) construction workers from out-of-state (or in this case out of the
“multiplier” region) would likely use a majority of their earnings (earnings used for household
spending) in the state where they live and not in the states of New Jersey and New York and (2)
to provide conservative estimates.

Disaster Funding
This analysis was conducted for New Jersey and New York only, despite Federal disaster relief
dollars going to a number of other states affected by Hurricane Sandy. Eleven months after the
storm, FEMA reported that $13.5 billion had been allocated to six states.53 We assume,
however, that both New Jersey and New York will spend the dollar amounts that they
determined were needed to completely recover from the storm. Sources of these construction
dollars would include a combination of Federal assistance, insurance payments and State and
local government spending on damage repair.
Finally, as stated in the report itself, it is possible to perform a RIMS analysis county by county
and/or for multiple contiguous counties (such as the Jersey shore) if data are available on either
(1) long-term industry production losses as a result of the storm or (2) construction projects
completed or underway to repair damage from the storm. At this time, we have not found data
to support this detailed county level of analysis.
