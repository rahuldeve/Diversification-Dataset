Net Heat Generation from Deforestation  
 

1.1. Background 
 

 

 

Although global warming is scientifically accepted, its cause is still disputed. Nordell (2003) 
suggested a most natural explanation; that this warming is a result of heat emissions from the 
global  consumption  of  non-renewable  energy.  Global  warming  means  that  heat  has  been 
accumulating in air, ground, and water since 1880. During the same period heat was released 
into the atmosphere by heat dissipation from the global use of fossil fuel and nuclear power. 
Any such thermal pollution must contribute to the warming. A comparison of accumulated 
and emitted heat show that heat emissions explains 55% of the global warming. Moreover, the 
amount of emitted heat is underestimated, since the non-commercial use of fossil fuel is not 
included, e.g. gas flares, underground coal fires, oil used in production of plastics, and also 
biofuel (wood) consumed at a greater rate than the growth. Here, the task was to estimate the 
heating caused by one of the non-commercial energy sources, the deforestation. 
 

1.2. Definition 
 

Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forest land use (See Picture 1.1). It 
can  be  the  result  of  the  deliberate  removal  of  forest  cover  for  agriculture  or  urban 
development,  or  it  can  be  a  consequence  of  grazing  animals,  wild  or  domesticated. 
Deforestation  has  thus  many  causes.   Population  pressures,  profits,  and  internal  social  and 
political  forces  can  also  all  push  up  the  rate  of  forest  loss. Generally  the  removal  or 
destruction of significant areas of forest cover has resulted in a degraded environment with 
reduced biodiversity.  
 
Deforestation includes not only the conversion to non-forest, but also degradation that reduces 
forest  quality,  the  density  and  structure  of  the  trees,  the  ecological  services  supplied,  the 
biomass of plants and animals, the species diversity and the genetic diversity. 
 
Deforestation results from removal of trees without sufficient reforestation and usually results 
in a significant loss of biodiversity.

1.3. Impact on the Environment 
 

 

Deforestation affects the amount of water in the soil and groundwater and the moisture in the 
atmosphere.  Forests  influence  thus  climate.  Forests  support  considerable  biodiversity, 
providing valuable habitat for wildlife; moreover, forests foster medicinal conservation and 
the recharge of aquifers. 
 
Forests are also important stores of organic carbon, and forests can extract carbon dioxide and 
pollutants from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability and probably relevant to the 
greenhouse  effect.  Tropical  deforestation  contributes  as  much  as  90%  of  the  current  net 
release of biotic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This change may represent as much as 
20% - 30% of the total carbon flux due to humans, i.e. the carbon release due to fossil fuel 
burning [1].  Deforestation is consequently an important potential source of carbon. 
 
Forests  are  also  valued  for  their  aesthetic  beauty  and  as  a  cultural  resource  and  tourist 
attraction.   
 
 

1.4. Forest management 

 
Forest  management  has  many  goals. It  typically  aims  to  maximize  annual  harvest  while 
ensuring that the area harvested is consistent with forest regrowth rates and total area.  This 
might result in a second harvest of the same forest plot after some 60-100 years.   
 
Forests on federal and state lands are usually managed according to multiple use doctrine.  
This means that in addition to forest harvest, the land is available for recreation and maintains 
a  healthy  forest  ecosystem.   Managing  to  protect  biodiversity  and  to  restore  pre-settlement 
conditions are relatively recent goals (Pict. 1.2).  In many parts of the world, forest may be 
used by indigenous people for subsistence hunting, or as a place to live. These people add 
more considerations, and more stakeholders, to the challenge of forest management.

1.5. Transformation of the Forest Area  

 
Deforestation is mainly due to the human action. The impact of people has been and continues 
to be profound. Forests are cleared, degraded and fragmented by timber harvest, conversion to

agriculture, road-building, human-caused fire, and in myriad other ways. The effort to use and 
subdue  the  forest  has  been  a  constant  theme  in  the  transformation  of  the  earth,  in  many 
societies, in many lands, and at most times. However, it is impossible to overstate exactly the 
importance of humankind's clearing of the forests. 
 
The purpose of this section is to evaluate as right as possible the impact of deforestation on 
the net heat generation since 1880. 
 
 

1.5.1.  The Original Forest 

 
Originally, almost half of the United States, three-quarters of Canada, almost all of Europe, 
the plains of the Levant, and much of the rest of the world were forested. The forests have 
mostly been removed for fuel, building materials and to clear land for farming. The clearing 
of the forests has been one of the most historic and prodigious feats of humanity. About one 
half of the forests that covered the Earth are gone. 
 
For millennia, humankind has influenced the forests, although much of the impact has been 
relatively minor. Today, the impact is enormous. Deforestation is expanding and accelerating 
into  the  remaining  areas  of  undisturbed  forest,  and  the  quality  of  the  remaining  forests  is 
declining.   
 
 

1.5.2.  Transformation of the Forest Area for different part of the world since 1700 
 

Until  quite  recently,  most  of  the  deforestation  occurred  in  Europe,  North  Africa,  North 
America  and  the  Middle  East.  The  Picture  1.3  shows  the  evolution  of  the  forest  in  United 
States. Now, deforestation in these regions has stabilized and regrowth is occurring (though 
second  growth  forests  have  quite  different  character).  In  the  last  few  decades,  the  vast 
majority of deforestation has occurred in the tropics - and the pace still accelerates.  
 
 

 

 

Pict. 1.3, Area of primary forests in the United States (cid:31)(around 1620, 1850 and 1920) [1]. 

Since 1600, 90% of the virgin forests that once covered much of the lower 48 states have been cleared away.  Most of the 
remaining old-growth forests in the lower 48 states and Alaska are on public lands.  In the Pacific Northwest about 80% of 

this forestland is slated for logging. 

 
 
The Graph 1.4 shows the transformation of the forest area since 1700. The values between 
1700  and  1980  were  obtained  from  the  database  established  by  Grubbler  (1990)  [2].  The 
deforestation  decreases  in  Europe  since  1700,  whereas  the  global  deforestation  worldwide 
increases. North America reached a peak between 1800 and 1850, which corresponds to the 
colonisation  of  the  continent.  Between  1980  and  2000,  the  amount  of  deforested  area  was

the rate of deforestation has been decreasing since 1980.

Richards (1990) estimated that over the last three centuries, roughly 1200 million ha of forests 
and  woodlands  have  been  cleared,  grasslands  and  pastures  have  diminished  by  about  560 
million ha, and cropland areas have increased by 1200 million ha [3]. Since 1700, roughly 20 
percent of the worlds forests and woodlands have disappeared; the actual forest represents 30 
percent of the land surface. These results confirm those of Grubbler. Unfortunately we do not 
have any confirmation for the FAO values between 1980 and 2000.

1.5.3.  The Actual Forest 

 
According to a report provided by European Parliament [4], which values were estimated by 
FAO (Appendix 1), the world forest can be divided into two kinds: Temperate and Tropical 
Forest (Graph 1.6) (See Pictures 1.7). 

Graph 1.6, Division of world Temperate Forest (Green) and World Tropical Forest (Yellow) [4].

This source presents also estimation of world temperate forest surface and of world tropical 
forest surface in 1990 (Map 1.8). The world temperate forest surface has been estimated at 
around 2330.5 millions of ha and the world tropical forest surface at around 1756.3 millions 
of ha. The temperate forest includes: all Europe, Ex-URSS, North America, Australia, Japan, 
New-Zealand,  South  Africa,  Argentina,  Chilli,  China,  Mongolia  and  Korea.  The  tropical 
forest includes: Africa, Asia, Pacific, Latin America, and Caribbean.

Moreover, this source evaluated the VOB (Volume over Bark or tree volume) in cubic meter, 
depending on the type of the forest. In the case considering only the tree trunk, the VOB for a 
temperate forest was estimated at about 170 billion cubic meter; in the other case considering 
all parts of trees, the total aboveground VOB was estimated at about 213 billion cubic meters. 
In this study the second value of VOB is considered since we are interested in deforestation 
impact and not of the wood exploitation. Hence, the BEF (Biomass Expansion Factor = the 
ratio of total aboveground oven-dry biomass density of trees to the oven-dry biomass density 
of the inventoried volume) can be defined: BEF = 1.25 for a temperate forest. The BEF was 
estimated at roughly 1.3 for a conifer forest (Peters, 1977). 
 
From the value of VOB and the value of world temperate forest surface, the VOB per ha can 
be obtained: 92 m3/ha.  
 
In tropical forest, only the VOB per ha is provided, which is 300 m3/ha in dense forest. It is 
absolutely  impossible  to  evaluate  the  VOB  in  tropical  forest  taking  into  accounts  the  large 
variety of trees. However, according to the difference between the global VOB estimated by 
Hagler and the VOB for a temperate forest, the VOB for a tropical forest would be roughly 
130 cubic meter; the result has to be considered like an order of magnitude. 
 
 

1.6. Aboveground Biomass Density  

 
 The  Aboveground  Biomass  Density  can  be  evaluated  from  the  method  suggested  by  FAO 
[5]. This method is based on existing volume per ha data and is best used for secondary to 
mature  closed  forests  only,  growing  in  moist  to  dry  climates.  It  should  be  used  for  closed 
forest  only  because  the  original  database  used  for  developing  this  approach  was  based  on 
closed forests. The primary data needed for this approach is VOB/ha (Volume Over Bark).  
  
Biomass  density  can  be  calculated  from  VOB/ha  by  first  estimating  the  biomass  of  the 
inventoried volume and then "expanding" this value to take into account the biomass of the 
other aboveground components as follows (Formula 1.9, Brown and Lugo, 1992):  
 
 

Aboveground biomass density (t/ha) = VOB * WD * BEF   

       (1.9) 

 
where: 
WD = volume-weighted average wood density;  
BEF = biomass expansion factor. 
 
 

1.6.1.  Wood Density 

 
Wood  Density  (WD)  is  defined  as  the  oven-dry  mass  per  unit  of  green  volume  (tons/m3). 
DETIENNE and CHANSON evaluated the wood density average at 0.73 after investigating 
3805 species of trees [6]. The Table 1.10 describes the WD for tropical forest.

1.6.2.  Biomass Expansion Factor 

1.6.2.1. Broadleaf forests 

 
Biomass  Expansion  Factor  is  defined  as:  the  ratio  of  total  aboveground  oven-dry  biomass 
density of trees to the oven-dry biomass density of the inventoried volume. Such ratios have 
been calculated from inventory sources for many broadleaf forest types (young secondary to 
mature)  growing  in  moist  to  seasonally  dry  climates  throughout  the  tropics  (Brown  et  al. 
1989).  The  reported  inventoried  volume  in  the  studies  was  based  on  the  definition  given 
above. BEFs is significantly related to the corresponding biomass of the inventoried volume 
according to the following equations (Brown and Lugo 1992): 
 
 

        BEF = e 3.2130.526*Ln(BV )

 

]            for BV < 190 t/ha            (1.11) 
 

for BV 190t/ha 

[

BEF= 1.74    

 

where: 
BV = biomass of inventoried volume in t/ha, calculated as the product of VOB/ha (m3/ha) and wood 
density (t/m3). 
 

1.6.2.2. Conifer forests 

 
No  model  for  calculating  biomass  expansion  factors  for  native  conifer  forests  is  presently 
available because of the general lack of sufficient data for the type of analysis performed for 
the broadleaf forests. However, one would expect that BEFs for tropical pine forests would 
vary  less  than  for  broadleaf  forests  because  of  the  generally  similar  branching  pattern 
exhibited by different species of pine trees. Until additional data become available, a BEF of 
1.3 can be used, with caution, for biomass estimation of pine forests. 
 
 

1.7. Results 

 
The  results  were  summarised  in  the  Table  1.12.  The  global  deforestation  generated           
between 8.174 1014 and 9.333 1014 kWh since 1850, depending on the PCI average (between 
2.89 and 3.3 kWh/kg).

1.8. Reviews and Uncertainties 

 
These results have to be considered with some reviews taking into account the hard work to 
estimate  the  global  deforestation  since  1850,  i.e.  the  deforested  area  and  also  the  VOB.  
Moreover, the way to convert from m3/ha to t/ha also means uncertainties since we have to 
make an average of all trees; it is the same point to convert from ton to kWh.  
 
According to the table 5.12, deforestation is mainly occurring in tropical forest (Pict. 1.13); 
the VOB tropical forest is quite overestimated; we can guess that the mean net heat generation 
is a maximum. 
 

Pict. 1.13, Deforestation in Amazonia. 

 

 
 

1.9. Conclusion 

 
In  spite  of  some  uncertainties,  we  obtained  a  net  heat  generation  of  8.2.1014  kWh  from 
deforestation  since  1880.  Deforestation  would  then  contribute  for  the  biggest  part  of  non-
commercial heat generation, i.e. about 30% of the missing heat. Basically, it represents 10.8% 
of the total net heat generation.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations leads international efforts to 
defeat hunger. Serving both developed and developing countries, FAO acts as a neutral forum 
where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy. FAO is also a 
source  of  knowledge  and  information.  We  help  developing  countries  and  countries  in 
transition modernize and improve agriculture, forestry and fisheries practices and ensure good 
nutrition for all. Since our founding in 1945, we have focused special attention on developing 
rural  areas,  home  to  70  percent  of  the  world's  poor  and  hungry  people.  FAO's  activities 
comprise four main areas: 
 

-  Putting information within reach; 
-  Sharing policy expertise; 
-  Providing a meeting place for nations; 
-  Bringing knowledge to the field. 

 
 
FAO  is  governed  by  the  Conference  of  Member  Nations,  which  meets  every  two  years  to 
review  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Organization  and  approve  a  Programme  of  Work  and 
Budget for the next biennium. 
 
 
The FAO Forestry Web site provides literally thousands of pages of information, access to all 
of  FAOs  forest-related  databases,  detailed  country  profiles  and  links  to  documents  on  all 
aspects  of  forestry.  Recent  additions  include  new  sites  on  forest  fire,  national  forest 
programmes and forest reproductive material, among others.
