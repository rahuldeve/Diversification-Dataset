Data Link Protocols

Relates to Lab 2.
This module covers data link layer issues, such as local area networks
(LANs) and point-t o-point links, Ethernet, and the Point-to-Point Protocol
(PPP).

TCP/IP Suite and OSI Reference Model
• The TCP/IP protocol stack does
not define the lower layers of a
complete protocol stack
• In this lecture, we will address how
the TCP/IP protocol stacks
interfaces with the data link layer

Data Link Layer
• The main tasks of the data link layer are:
• Transfer data from the network layer of one machine to
the network layer of another machine
• Convert the raw bit stream of the physical layer into
groups of bits (“frames”)

Two types of networks at the data link layer
– Broadcast Networks: All stations share a single
communication channel
– Point-to-Point Networks: Pairs of hosts (or routers) are
directly connected

Broadcast Network

•

Point-to-Point Network

Typically, local area networks (LANs) are broadcast and wide area
networks (WANs) are point-to-point

Local Area Networks
• Local area networks (LANs) connect computers within a
building or a enterprise network
• Almost all LANs are broadcast networks
• Typical topologies of LANs are bus or ring or star
• We will work with Ethernet LANs. Ethernet has a bus or star
topology.

MAC and LLC

Data Link
Layer

• In any broadcast network, the stations must ensure that only
one station transmits at a time on the shared communication
channel
• The protocol that determines who can transmit on a broadcast
channel are called Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
• The MAC protocol are implemented
to Network Layer
in the MAC sublayer which is the
Logical Link
lower sublayer of the data link layer
Control
• The higher portion of the data link
Medium Access
Control
layer is often called Logical Link
Control (LLC)
to Physical Layer

IEEE 802 Standards
• IEEE 802 is a family of standards for LANs, which defines
an LLC and several MAC sublayers

Ethernet
• Speed:
• Standard:

10Mbps -10 Gbps
802.3, Ethernet II (DIX)

•
•
•
•

10Base5
10Base2
10Base-T
100Base-TX

• 100Base-FX
• 1000Base-FX
• 10000Base-FX

Thick Ethernet: 10 Mbps coax cable
Thin Ethernet: 10 Mbps coax cable
10 Mbps Twisted Pair
100 Mbps over Category 5 twisted pair
100 Mbps over Fiber Optics
1Gbps over Fiber Optics
1Gbps over Fiber Optics (for wide area links)

Bus Topology
• 10Base5 and 10Base2 Ethernets has a bus topology

Star Topology
• Starting with 10Base-T, stations are connected to a hub in a
star configuration

Ethernet Hubs vs. Ethernet Switches
•

•

An Ethernet switch is a packet switch for Ethernet frames
• Buffering of frames prevents collisions.
• Each port is isolated and builds its own collision domain
An Ethernet Hub does not perform buffering:
• Collisions occur if two frames arrive at the same time.

Ethernet and IEEE 802.3: Any Difference?
• There are two types of Ethernet frames in use, with subtle
differences:
• “Ethernet” (Ethernet II, DIX)
• An industry standards from 1982 that is based on the
first implementation of CSMA/CD by Xerox.
• Predominant version of CSMA/CD in the US.
• 802.3:
• IEEE’s version of CSMA/CD from 1985.
• Interoperates with 802.2 (LLC) as higher layer.
• Difference for our purposes: Ethernet and 802.3 use
different methods to encapsulate an IP datagram.

Point-to-Point (serial) links
• Many data link connections are
point-to-point serial links:
– Dial-in or DSL access connects hosts
to access routers
– Routers are connected by
high-speed point-to-point links

• Here, IP hosts and routers are
connected by a serial cable

Router
Modems

Dial-Up Access

• Data link layer protocols for pointto-point links are simple:
– Main role is encapsulation of IP
datagrams
– No media access control needed

15

Data Link Protocols for Point-to-Point links
• SLIP (Serial Line IP)
• First protocol for sending IP datagrams over dial-up links (from
1988)
• Encapsulation, not much else

• PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
• Successor to SLIP (1992), with added functionality
• Used for dial-in and for high-speed routers

• HDLC (High-Level Data Link) :
• Widely used and influential standard (1979)
• Default protocol for serial links on Cisco routers
• Actually, PPP is based on a variant of HDLC

PPP - IP encapsulation
•

The frame format of PPP is similar to HDLC and the 802.2 LLC frame
format:

•
•
•

PPP assumes a duplex circuit
Note: PPP does not use addresses
Usual maximum frame size is 1500
17

Additional PPP functionality
• In addition to encapsulation, PPP supports:
–
–
–
–
–
–

multiple network layer protocols (protocol multiplexing)
Link configuration
Link quality testing
Error detection
Option negotiation
Address notification

– Authentication
• The

–

above functions are supported by helper protocols:
LCP
PAP, CHAP
NCP

PPP Support protocols
• Link management: The link control protocol (LCP) is
responsible for establishing, configuring, and negotiating a
data-link connection. LCP also monitors the link quality and is
used to terminate the link.
• Authentication: Authentication is optional. PPP supports two
authentication protocols: Password Authentication Protocol
(PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
(CHAP).
• Network protocol configuration: PPP has network control
protocols (NCPs) for numerous network layer protocols. The IP
control protocol (IPCP) negotiates IP address assignments
and other parameters when IP is used as network layer.

19

Switched networks
• Some data link technologies can be used to build
complete networks, with their own addressing, routing,
and forwarding mechanisms. These networks are often
called switched networks.
• At the IP layer, a switched network may like a point-topoint link or like a broadcast link

20

Switched networks
Data link layer technologies:
– Switched Ethernet
– ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
– Frame Relay
– Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
• Some switched networks are intended for enterprise networks
(Switched Ethernet), wide area networks (MPLS, Frame
Relay), or both (ATM)
• Some switched networks have a complete protocol suite.
