Précis
One of the principal outcomes of Rio+20 was the call to produce a set of universally applicable sustainable
development goals (SDGs) that balance the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable
development. This Paper provides advice and guidance on how environmental sustainability can be incorporated
in the SDGs.
An analysis of current environmental goals and targets shows that the successful ones are built on general
support from society and a scientiﬁc consensus that the problem exists and is urgent. The ones making most
progress tend to be embedded in effective governance regimes, and be easier to implement because solutions
are readily available. A key to success also seems to be that goals are underpinned by specific and measurable
targets.
After considering the above and other lessons from current goals, the following framework is proposed for
embedding environment in the SDGs:
1.	 A rationale and overarching vision for the SDGs, which is a narrative describing the basis for including
environmental sustainability in the SDGs;
2.	 An integrated approach for embedding environment in goals and targets which proposes basic
characteristics and types of goals and targets to be selected;
3.	 A set of six criteria for assessing or proposing goals and targets, and guidance on how to use them. The
criteria are: (i) Strong linkage of environment with socio-economic developmental goals; (ii) Decoupling
of socio-economic development from escalating resource use and environmental degradation; (iii)
Coverage of critical issues of environmental sustainability such as important irreversible changes in the
global environment; (iv) Take into account current global environmental goals and targets, (v) Scientifically
credible and verifiable; and (vi) Progress must be “trackable”.
4.	 A list of best practices for selecting indicators that can effectively support targets.
The framework and other ideas presented in the Paper are meant to stimulate a dialogue on environmental
sustainability and the SDGs.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Executive Summary
World leaders at the 2012 United Nations Conference
on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) reaffirmed
their commitment to sustainable development which
embraces economic progress, social development,
and environmental protection for the benefit of all.
One of the principal outcomes of Rio+20 was the call
to develop a set of universally applicable sustainable
development goals (SDGs) that carefully balance the
environmental, social and economic dimensions of
sustainable development. This Paper provides advice
and guidance on how environmental sustainability can
be incorporated in the SDGs. It is intended to stimulate
a dialogue on environmental sustainability and the
SDGs rather than be the last word on the subject.
Lessons Learned from Current Goals and Targets
While countries recommended that the SDGs take a
forward-looking approach, they also suggested that
the new goals be based on experiences from current
international goals and targets. With that in mind, it
has been observed that particularly successful goals
are …
•	 built on general support from society and a
scientiﬁc consensus regarding the urgency of the
problem;
•	 embedded in effective institutional and political
frameworks and governance regimes that ensure
implementation and compliance;
•	 made easier to implement because of the
availability of solutions;
•	 linked to specific and measurable targets.
On the negative side, a major barrier to their success
has been fragmentation with respect to design (by
neglecting the interconnectedness of goals, especially
the linkages between their environmental, social
and economic aspects) and the lack of coordination
between design, implementation and monitoring.

2

Other lessons coming from experience with MDG 7 and
other goals suggest that new goals and targets should
cover a wider range of important environmental
sustainability topics than currently covered, and
that these topics should be closely linked with socioeconomic developmental goals. In addition, it might
be more effective in some cases to devise goals that
target the core driving forces behind a problem rather
than the problem itself.

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

A Framework for Embedding Environmental
Sustainability in the SDGs
Building on lessons from existing goals, a framework
is suggested for embedding environmental sustainability into SDGs. This framework includes the
following:
The first part of the framework is the rationale and
overarching vision for the SDGs, which is a narrative
describing the basis for including environmental
sustainability in SDGs.
The second part is an integrated approach for
embedding the environment in goals and targets. This
approach includes:
1.	 A complementary set of goals and targets – An
important principle for selecting goals and targets
is that they should reinforce and complement each
other, firstly, by ensuring that they cover all of the
main objectives of the environmental, social and
economic dimensions of sustainable development;
and secondly, by ensuring that they work together
to maintain and restore the biological diversity and
ecosystem services necessary to meet social and
economic objectives.
2.	 Integrated goals – It is suggested to fill the
top level of the SDGs with a limited number of
integrated goals that are simple to understand, but
not necessarily simple in nature. The goals would
be “integrated” in the sense that they embody
all three aspects of sustainable development –
environmental, social and economic.
3.	 A mix of targets – Each of the integrated goals
should be underpinned by a mix of targets –
some integrated, and some “non-integrated”
(in the sense that they concentrate on either
environmental, social or economic objectives).
The preference is for integrated targets because
they can incorporate the interlinkages between
environmental, social and economic dimensions
of sustainable development, and have other
strengths. However, targets must also be specific
and measurable. If integrated targets cannot meet
these criteria then “non-integrated” targets may
be more appropriate. Hence, a mix of targets.
The third part of the framework is a set of criteria
for embedding environmental sustainability in SDGs.
The criteria can be used to assess goals and targets
already proposed in the SDG discussion process, or to

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

formulate new goals and targets that can be put into
the SDG discussion process.
The six criteria are:
Criterion 1. Strong linkage with developmental goals.
Within the SDGs environmental issues should be
strongly linked to socio-economic developmental
issues. The SDGs should “incorporate in a balanced
way all three dimensions of sustainable development and their interlinkages” (Rio+20 Outcome
Document). Perhaps the most fruitful way to
couple environment and socio-economic development within the SDGs is to formulate integrated
goals and targets, as previously described.
Criterion 2. Decoupling of socio-economic development from escalating resource use and environmental degradation. Goals and targets should be
formulated to promote the decoupling of socioeconomic development from unsustainable depletion of resources and increasing environmental
impact. They should encourage and support steadily improving resource efficiency through more efficient production and recycling, reducing waste, and
modifying unsustainable consumption patterns.
Criterion 3. Coverage of critical issues of environmental sustainability such as important irreversible changes in the global environment. The final
set of selected goals and targets should cover as
many critical environmental sustainability issues
(current and imminent) as possible. Priority should
be given to objectives that help avoid critical “irreversible” changes of the global environment.
Criterion 4. Take into account current global environmental goals and targets. This can be done by: (a)
using current goals and targets as a “ground floor”
for new goals and targets; (b) incorporating a small
number of important current goals and targets
whose implementation can be accelerated if they
are included in the SDGs.
Criterion 5. Scientifically credible and verifiable.
Goals and targets should be based on best scientific understanding, and support should be available from the scientific community to monitor and
implement them.
Criterion 6. Progress must be “trackable”. All goals
should be backed by specific and measurable
targets and indicators.

The final part of the framework is advice on best
practices for selecting indicators to support SDG
goals and targets. This advice includes recommended
characteristics of indicators, such as:
•	 The set of indicators for monitoring SDGs should
be limited in number and coherent, i.e. consistent
and complementary to each other within and in
between goals.
•	 They should be understandable, clear and
unambiguous in their interpretation.
•	 They should be specific and measurable.
•	 They should be clearly linked to the target and be
robust in providing measures of progress towards
targets.
•	 They should be relevant to policy making and
should change in response to policy interventions.
•	 Where possible, they should be linked to recognized
cost-effective tracking and monitoring systems to
establish their credibility and comparability.
•	 They could include both absolute and relative
changes in order to give a more complete picture
of performance.
Strengths of the framework
In sum, the framework proposed for embedding
environment in the SDGs brings the following benefits:
•	 Integrated goals, as opposed to single dimensional
goals, achieve a higher level of integration of the
three dimensions of sustainable development.
They will help ensure that all dimensions of
sustainable development are well represented in
the set of SDGs.
•	 Integrated goals, with at least some integrated
targets, will encourage governments and other
institutions to move away from the silo approach
to solving challenges of sustainable development.
•	 Giving the environment an equal footing to social
and economic considerations within the framework
shows that environmental sustainability is a
foundation for socio-economic development.
It encourages a type of development that minimizes
unintended environmental consequences and
strengthens adaptation and resilience to environmental and other changes.
It is hoped that this framework and other ideas
presented in the Paper will promote a fruitful
collaboration between the environmental community
and the many other constituencies working to develop
SDGs.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

1. Introduction
Rio+20 was an important stocktaking of the world’s
progress towards achieving sustainable development.
Certainly one of its key outcomes was the call to
develop sustainable development goals (SDGs) with
the aim to bring the world further along the path of
sustainable development. Countries saw the SDGs
as a chance to assess the global framework used to
monitor progress in sustainable development. They
also recognized that agreeing to a single set of SDGs
would help ensure that society was moving in the
same direction towards sustainability.
An important message was that this new set of
goals should carefully consider and balance the
three dimensions of sustainable development –
environmental, social and economic. In the meantime,
a fourth dimension, “peace and security” has been
suggested by the UN Task Team on the post-2015
UN Development Agenda1 and the Sustainable
Development Solutions Network.
Countries declared that the SDGs should be
transformational and address the multiple and
intertwined challenges of ensuring environmental
sustainability, eradicating extreme poverty, and
achieving economic and social wellbeing. They also
affirmed that these goals should be universally
applicable to all countries while taking into account
different national realities, capacities and levels
of development. While taking a forward-looking
approach to such goals, they recommended looking
back at the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and other goals and targets to learn from experience.
Rio + 20 also set in motion the machinery to develop
new goals and targets. The Open Working Group
(OWG) on SDGs will submit a proposal for SDGs to
the 68th session of the General Assembly, and the
UN was called in to support it through an interagency
technical support team. While the OWG is working
on the overall vision of SDGs, this Paper focuses on
the environmental dimensions of SDGs taking into
consideration their socio-economic dimensions.

4

Related to these activities are various strands of work
concerned with the UN development agenda beyond
2015. For example, the UN Secretary-General’s HighLevel Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015
Development Agenda has submitted a report on the
subject, while further ideas on the post-2015 agenda
are being collected by the UN Development Group at
national, regional and global thematic consultations.
Some of these processes have already produced
proposals for SDGs, as summarized in Box 1. Although
there are many different processes, they all need
input from a wide range of institutions concerned
with sustainable development. This Paper is intended
to provide such input.
One of the greatest challenges in developing SDGs will
be to incorporate all the dimensions of sustainable
development in a balanced way – environmental,
social, and economic. Each of these dimensions
requires careful thinking and analysis about the role
they will play in SDGs and how they will be interlinked.
This Paper is concerned in particular with the role of
environmental sustainability.
Although it focuses on one aspect of the bigger picture,
an important message here is that environment and
socio-economic development are so intricately linked
that development cannot be sustainable without
considering its environmental dimensions. In a similar
vein, it is now accepted that poverty eradication and
a lasting prosperity cannot be achieved if ecosystem
services and natural capital are degraded or lost.2
Countries underlined this at Rio+20 by noting that
socio-economic development and environmental
sustainability come together in the inclusive “Green
Economy”, naming it “one of the important tools
available for achieving sustainable development”.
Ushering in this Green Economy, and conserving and
using ecosystem services and natural capital in a
sustainable manner, are the kinds of transformative
changes that could and should be catalyzed by
sustainable development goals.
With these important ideas in mind, the main objective
of this Paper is to provide advice and guidance on how

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

environmental sustainability can be incorporated in
the SDGs. The Paper aims to stimulate a dialogue on
environmental sustainability and the SDGs rather than
be the last word on the subject.
The Paper begins with a brief review of lessons
learned from current global environmental goals
and targets relevant to the SDGs. It then discusses a
framework for embedding environment in the SDGs

that includes a statement of an overarching vision,
an approach to structuring goals and targets, a set
of criteria for assessing or deriving goals and targets,
and a list of best practices for indicators. It is hoped
that this framework and other ideas presented in the
Paper will promote a fruitful collaboration between
the environmental community and the many other
constituencies working to develop the SDGs.

Box 1: Some current proposals for SDGs
A number of publications have been released recently containing proposals for specific SDGs. A summary is given here:
•	 The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) in a briefing paper3 summarized ideas on SDGs based on
proposals from two UN Member States and the world’s Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). Colombia and Guatemala proposed 8
goals, while the CSOs proposed 17 goals. The goals are related to combating poverty, sustainable consumption and production,
sustainable livelihoods, youth and education, climate sustainability, clean energy, biodiversity and forests, water, healthy seas and
oceans, sustainable agriculture, environmental justice for the poor and marginalized, access to information, basic health and new
indicators of progress.
•	 The Centre for International Governance Innovation in collaboration with the Korea Development Institute proposed the “Bellagio
Goals”4, which include inclusive growth, food and water, education and skills, health, gender and equality, environmental
sustainability, security, resilient communities, infrastructure, civil and political rights and global governance.
•	 In a German Development Institute briefing paper5 it was suggested that the post-2015 international agenda could be structured
into two parts comprising of human development objectives (final goals) and provision of global public goods (instrumental goals). It
was proposed that the “final goals” could include reduction of income poverty, food security, education, health and family planning,
infrastructure (energy, housing, water and sanitation), environment (clean air and water, protection of resources), resilience
(human and social security), and good governance, while the “instrumental goals” could include limiting climate change, joint
global management of environmental resources, containing infectious diseases, improving the stability of financial markets, curbing
international terrorism and disarmament of anti-personnel mines and weapons of mass destruction. However, in another briefing
paper from the same institute6, seven goals, including food security for all, water security for all, health for all, sustainable energy
for all, opportunities for all, peace and justice for all and earth system security, were proposed.
•	 Griggs and colleagues7 proposed a set of six SDGs that were developed by combining the MDGs with conditions that were claimed
to be necessary to assure the stability of the Earth’s systems. The proposed goals include thriving lives and livelihoods, sustainable
food security, sustainable water security, universal clean energy, healthy and productive ecosystems and governance for sustainable
societies.
•	 The High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda in its report8 to the UN Secretary General proposed twelve illustrative
goals including ending poverty, empowering girls and women and achieving gender equality, providing quality education and
lifelong learning, ensuring healthy lives, ensuring food security and good nutrition, achieving universal access to water and
sanitation, securing sustainable energy, creating jobs, sustainable livelihoods and equitable growth, managing natural resource
assets sustainably, ensuring good governance and effective institutions, ensuring stable and peaceful societies and creating a global
enabling environment and catalysing long-term finance.
•	 The Sustainable Development Solutions Network in its report9 to the UN Secretary General proposed ten SDGs including ending
extreme poverty including hunger, achieving development within planetary boundaries, ensuring effective learning for all children
and youth for life and livelihood, achieving gender equality, social inclusion and human rights for all, achieving health and wellbeing
at all ages, improving agricultural systems and raising rural prosperity, empowering inclusive, productive and resilient cities, curbing
human-induced climate change and ensuring sustainable energy, securing ecosystem services and biodiversity and ensuring good
management of water and other natural resources, and transforming governance for sustainable development.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Part A. Experience with Global Environmental Goals
2. Lessons Learned from a Review of
Environmental Goals and Targets
What lessons are to be learned from current environmental goals and targets?
Over the last decades the international community has
adopted an impressive number of environmentallyrelated international agreements. According to one
count10 there are more than 500 such treaties. (As
an aside, 195 are concerned with water, 180 with
chemicals and wastes, 155 with biodiversity, 60 with
the atmosphere including climate change, and 45 with
land use.)
As part of an initiative to identify a core set of environmental goals,11 UNEP examined progress in achieving
90 important goals from these treaties and found that
only 4 of them showed significant progress12. From
this standpoint, there is much unfinished business on
the international environmental agenda.
So what have we learned from this and other reviews of
goals and targets? The following factors, in particular,
seemed to have played a key role in successfully
meeting goals:
•	 Consensus and support from the scientiﬁc
community provides confidence to policymakers
that a problem is significant and requires action13.
•	 Related to the previous point, the general support
of society for these goals is also a key ingredient
for making progress. This requires clearly

communicating the significance of the goals,
including how they affect peoples’ lives.
•	The availability of solutions for addressing an
environmental problem sometimes (but not always)
raises the political will of signatories, and enables
the raising of funds for implementing a treaty.14
Furthermore, success in achieving a goal depends
on the ease with which a targeted problem can
be broken down into pieces, each of which is
amenable to solution.15
•	The principle of common but differentiated
responsibilities16 embedded in many agreements
encourages agreement on common overarching
goals while allowing individual countries to
comply at a different pace using different targets
and timelines for implementation. Responsibilities
of countries are typically related to historical and
current contributions to environmental problems,
and to current/future capacities to address them.
•	 A key factor is embedding goals in effective
governance
regimes
that
ensure
their
implementation, accountability and compliance.
Ultimately, the effectiveness of implementing
environmental goals depends on how well they
are integrated into institutional and governance
frameworks at all levels (international, regional,
national and sub-national). Effective governance
includes adequate follow-up and compliance
systems with independent monitoring and
evaluation, and effective financing and economic
incentives. Related to this, the MDGs and other

12
	 The four goals showing significant progress are the goals on protection of the ozone layer, the phasing out of lead in gasoline, the MDG on halving the
proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015, and improving research in order to prevent, eliminate and reduce pollution of
the marine environment. On the other hand, 40 showed some progress; 24 showed little to no progress; 7 showed further deterioration; 14 had insufficient
data; and for one, it was too soon to assess its status. More details in the two references above.
13
	 The 1987 Montreal Protocol provides an example in which states took precautionary measures to control ozone-depleting substances at the time the agreement
was signed. Only later, over the course of a decade and in light of further scientific findings was the reduction schedule tightened. (See Kiss & Shelton. 2004.
International Environmental Law, 3rd ed., Transnational Publishers, Inc. Ardsley, NY, p. 576)
14
	 An example is the case of the Montreal Protocol, in which it is thought that the availability of economical substitutes for ozone-depleting substances was a
factor in leading to an agreement on controlling these substances. See for example, Peloso, C. 2010. Crafting an international climate change protocol: applying
the lessons learned from the success of the Montreal Protocol and the ozone depletion problem. Florida University Journal of Land Use and Environmental Law,
25, 305-329 and UNEP 2012. Global Environment Outlook – 5. United Nations Environment Programme (http://www.unep.org/GEo/geo5.asp).
15
	 For example, in the case of the ozone treaty, negotiators could break down the sources of ozone-depleting substances into specific product-producing sectors
that could be effectively targeted for mitigation. So the lesson here is to develop goals that are less complex in their definition and solution.
16
	 This principle assigns different obligations to developing and developed countries for tackling environmental problems based on their historical responsibility
for these problems and their current capacity to address these problems.

goals have shown the need for a broad-based,

•	 Linkage of goals with specific and measurable
targets. One of the strongest conclusions from the
analysis of global goals was that those showing
the greatest progress had the most specific
and measurable targets. This was also a major
conclusion of the Secretary-General’s High Level
Panel on Sustainability.18
Why? It was suggested that measurable targets
encourage countries and the international
community to collect and coordinate data
about the environmental goal, providing a
basis for tracking progress and determining
compliance. These data also help determine
needed solutions to achieve goals.
Conversely, goals without specific targets beg
the question as to whether they are successful
or not. Examples are the goals aiming to protect
or restore freshwater quality which are not
backed up by sufficient baseline field data.19
But the lessons here are not so clear. If progress
is slow because of the lack of data, does it mean
that only targets backed up by data should be
selected? Or does it mean that measurement
programmes for collecting necessary data can
follow the selection of measurable targets?
What about developing countries with limited
resources for data collection? Should targets
be selected only if data to support them are
cheap to collect, or if they receive external
support for data collection and management?
Here are a few tentative answers to these
questions:

8

i.	 Goals should be backed up by targets that
are measurable. This should be a minimum
criterion. If targets are not measurable, it
is doubtful that they should be considered.
Note, however, that “measurable” can be
broadly interpreted. For example, many
targets having to do with the “quality”
of something, quality of education for
example, can now be measured. Also,
	 some targets can be backed by measurable
proxy indicators or indices of performance.
(See Section 10, Tracking Progress on Goals
and Targets).
ii.	 If a goal has the option of having two equally
good targets, then the target backed up by
the greatest amount of data and cheapest
costs for data collection should be given
extra weight.20 On the other hand, while
relative availability and costs of data should
be given consideration in the selection of
targets, they should not be the only criteria.
iii.	 If no data are available to back up a target,
then an analysis should be carried out on
the costs and effort needed to develop
the necessary data, and this information
should be factored into the decision about
whether to select a particular target or not.
On the negative side, a factor working against
the achievement of goals is neglecting their interconnectedness. In general, global environmental goals
have been developed in a fragmented manner in part
because some environmental issues tend to be ready
for international action sooner than others. Why?
Perhaps because some issues appear more urgent
than others, or because a critical level of scientific
knowledge about a problem is reached, or because
solutions to the problem become available.

For example, if a health goal has a choice of two possible air pollution targets -- a target for reducing emissions of particulate matter, or a target for limiting
atmospheric levels of particulate matter – and both are considered equally satisfactory for tracking progress, then the one with the more data available and
lowest costs of measurement or estimation should be given special weight.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Whatever the reason, this fragmented approach can
lead to achieving one goal at the expense of another.21
Part of the problem is the lack of a coordinated response
from governments because different departments are
responsible for different problems. This fragmented
way of dealing with problems can also put a large
burden on governments in terms of reporting and
fulﬁlling their obligations to several different treaties,
and may imply a wastage of resources.
It is essential, therefore, that SDG developers take
into account the interlinkages among new goals.22

3. Experience with MDG-7 – The
Millennium Development Goal on
Environmental Sustainability
What can we learn from experience with MDG-7?
Environmental objectives in the Millennium
Development Goals are concentrated in MDG-7
– “Ensure Environmental Sustainability” with its
four subsidiary targets. The 2012 UN MDGs report23
together with other evaluations24 have come to the
following conclusions about these targets:
Target 7a: Integrate the principles of sustainable
development into country policies and programmes
and reverse the loss of environmental resources.
A look at the five indicators defined for this target
shows full compliance with only the one having to do
with reducing the consumption of ozone depleting
substances. Other indicators show much slower
progress. Total forest loss continues, although it has
slowed from an annual loss of 8.3 million hectares
in the 1990s to 5.2 million hectares in 201025.
Meanwhile, global emissions of CO2 did drop between
2008 and 200926, but they are now rising again.

With respect to the proportion of fish stocks within
safe biological limits, the overexploitation of marine
fisheries reached a new peak in 2008. According to
the FAO, approximately 30% of marine fish stocks
were overexploited in 2009.27 For the indicator on the
proportion of total water resources used, the 2011 UN
MDGs report28 indicates slow or no progress.
Target 7b: Reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010,
a significant reduction in the rate of loss. A review
of the two indicators for this target (proportion of
terrestrial and marine areas protected and proportion
of species threatened with extinction) indicates slow
progress or decline.
Target 7c: Halve, by 2015, the proportion of the
population without sustainable access to safe
drinking water and basic sanitation. The 2012 UN
MDG report indicates that the world has met the
global target on access to safe drinking water but is
making slow progress towards the sanitation target.
The significance of meeting the drinking water target
should not be underestimated because it means that
millions of people have gained access to safer water
supplies. But more needs to be done. The 2012 UN
MDG report indicates that despite global success,
regions including Oceania and sub-saharan Africa
are not on track to meet the drinking water target.
Over 40% of the global population without improved
drinking water supplies are in sub-saharan Africa.
Target 7d: Achieve, by 2020, a significant improvement
in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. The
2012 UN MDG report indicates that this target has been
met well in advance of the deadline. Nevertheless, the
absolute number of slum dwellers continues to grow.
To sum up, on the positive side, the goal-setting
approach of the MDGs has provided a focal point

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
21	
For example, it has been argued that a side effect of achieving the goals of combatting ozone depletion through the Montreal Protocol has been an increasing
threat to the success of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. It turns out that one of the main substitutes for ozone-depleting substances are
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which happen to be potent greenhouse gases. While the concentration of HFCs is still low in the atmosphere, it is building up rapidly
because countries are switching to HFCs to comply with the Montreal Protocol (See UNEP 2011. HFCs: A Critical Link in Protecting Climate and the Ozone Layer.
United Nations Environment Programme. Nairobi. http://www.unep.org/dewa/Portals/67/pdf/HFC_report.pdf). Hence a solution to ozone depletion under
one treaty has turned out to undermine the achievement of climate targets under another treaty.
22	
For this purpose it would be useful to have a theoretical construct for looking at the SDGs.

for advocacy, improved the effective targeting and
channelling of funds, and improved the monitoring
of development projects29. The simplicity and
transparency of the goals have made them easyto-communicate and to rally around.30 All in all,
MDGs and other international goals have served as
beacons for raising the material wellbeing of millions
of people.
On the negative side, as noted above, insufficient
progress has been made on many environmental
themes, including biodiversity loss and degradation
of ecosystems. Moreover, MDG-7 has too limited a
coverage of environmental sustainability issues, and
omits many important topics concerned with arid
and semi-arid, oceanic, mountain, grassland, and
arctic ecosystems, among others. It does not deal
with the growing problems of air pollution and water
pollution throughout much of the developing world,
the accumulation of chemical wastes, or the on-going
unsustainable consumption of natural resources.
Also neglected have been important synergies and
interlinkages between MDG-7 and other MDGs.
For example, despite the crucial link between
environmental sustainability and poverty, health and
job creation,31 the environmental themes in MDG-7
are not linked to the poverty and hunger reduction
targets in MDG 1.
Furthermore, MDG-7 focuses exclusively on changes
in the state of the environment rather than on the
driving forces behind these changes. Some believe that
addressing these driving forces could lead to greater
wins for sustainable development. In support of this,
it is worth noting that an MDG-7 indicator showing
substantial progress is “reducing the consumption of
ozone depleting substances” which indeed addresses

10

the driving force of the problem, rather than the
problem itself (“depletion of the ozone layer”).32
Also, some of the targets of MDG-7 are difficult to
measure and some of its indicators are not well
defined. It is difficult, for example, to measure to what
degree countries have incorporated the principles of
sustainable development into their national policies
and programmes (Target 7a). Another example is
the case of “significant improvement in the lives of
slum dwellers” (Target 7d) in which the indicator was
defined in proportional units rather than absolute
numbers. This provides an incomplete indication
of progress as the proportion of slum dwellers goes
down, but their absolute numbers go up.33 Another
example is the case of reduced biodiversity loss (Target
7b) in which the proportion of terrestrial and marine
areas under protection is increasing, yet biodiversity
continues to decrease.34
Lastly, weaknesses in the formulation of MDG-7, have
in turn, led to problems in their implementation. The
vagueness of some targets has made it difficult for
governments to find the right actions for pursuing
the targets. Successful implementation also requires
adequate measurement and data systems.35
So what are the lessons to be learned? Firstly, progress
in achieving MDG-7 has been uneven and there is still
a lot of ground to cover before all of its targets can be
achieved by 2015.36 Hence, new goals and targets may
need to pick up some of the unfinished business of
MDG-7. Secondly, new goals and targets should cover a
wider range of important environmental sustainability
topics, including emerging issues. Furthermore, these
topics need to be closely linked with developmental
goals. Thirdly, it might be more effective to devise
goals that address the driving forces of a problem

	 But focusing on driving forces rather than final objectives may also have some disadvantages. Firstly, stakeholders would have to agree on which driving forces
are important in achieving the final objectives. Secondly, expressing goals and targets as driving forces (reduce air pollution sources in cities by 50%) may not
be as inspiring as expressing them as final objectives (reduce the level of air pollution in cities by 50%).

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

rather than the problem itself. Finally, special effort
should be invested in defining targets and indicators
that are measurable.
Another overarching lesson is that it is crucial to avoid
fragmentation in setting and implementing goals and
this can best be done by taking a holistic approach to
designing, implementing, and monitoring SDGs. This
holistic approach has to be supported by governance
structures dedicated to sustainable development,
and by well organized means of tracking progress and
accountability at the national and global levels.

4. Effects of MDGs on the Environment
What can we learn from the effects of the MDGs on
the environment?
While only MDG-7 had a clear focus on the
environment, the other MDGs nevertheless had
indirect impacts on the environment, both positive
and negative.
On the positive side, it is thought that the MDG 2
goal for universal primary education has encouraged
greater awareness of the need for environmental
protection.37
On the other hand, progress towards achieving MDGs
can have a negative impact on the environment
when not properly implemented. As an example, the
current way of reducing poverty and hunger (MDG 1)
is linked in many cases to greater output from modern
agriculture accompanied by its requirements for water,
synthetic chemical fertilizers, herbicides and intensive
use of machinery (although smallholder producers
also make a significant contribution to worldwide food
production but without heavy machinery and usually

with a much lower environmental impact). Agriculture
accounts for 70% of freshwater withdrawals
and contributes greatly to freshwater pollution.
Environmental side effects of crop cultivation include
pesticide contamination of neighbouring ecosystems,
nitrate pollution of groundwater, eutrophication of
surface waters and coastal zones, soil compaction, and
emissions of the important greenhouse gas, nitrous
oxide, as well as emissions of air pollutants nitrogen
dioxide and ammonia.38 Expansion of cropland and
rangeland to provide more food has also contributed to
deforestation and higher greenhouse gas emissions.39
But an important point is that many of these impacts
can be substantially reduced by practicing tried and
tested models of sustainable agriculture as well as by
boosting the efficiency of the food system.40
Another example comes from the Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment (MA). The MA’s scenarios
show that the beneficial expansion of public water
supply for households and industry may result in a
large increase in wastewater loadings to freshwater
ecosystems in many developing regions over the
course of the first half of the 21st century41. This, in
turn, could lead to major water pollution problems
including threats to the freshwater fishery and food
security in some developing countries.42 On the other
hand, if wastewater is treated or water use efficiency is
increased, the expansion of water supply may not lead
to major water pollution problems. Put another way, it
is possible for society to benefit from an expansion of
public water supply without decreasing its wellbeing
through inadvertent water pollution.
What are the lessons to be learned here?
Firstly, new goals and targets should aim to minimize
the environmental impacts of developmental activities.

	 Although, no analysis of the effect of increased primary education on the environment currently exists, it is believed that the MDG goal on education can raise
awareness of the need for environmental protection. This positive effect would however depend on the quality of primary education. See: UNESCO 2010.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Secondly, the environmental impacts of the MDGs can
be minimized by how the goals are implemented. For
example, the environmental side effects of agriculture
can be reduced through sustainable agriculture, while
the inadvertent water pollution caused by expanding
water supply systems can be minimized by treating
wastewater or boosting water efficiency.
The third point is that good environmental practices
contribute to achieving developmental goals. Examples
from the emerging and inclusive “Green Economy”
provide many illustrations of how environmental
sustainability and socio-economic development can
work hand-in-hand. For example, biological diversity
underpins ecosystem functioning and the provision
of ecosystem services essential for human wellbeing. It provides for food security, human health,
the provision of clean air and water; it contributes to
local livelihoods, and economic development, and is
essential for the achievement of the MDGs and SDGs,
including poverty alleviation.43

5. Relevance of Current Global
Environmental Goals in relation to SDGs
What role should current goals play in SDGs?
We have seen that there is much to be learned from
current goals. How, then, can we use this experience?
First, the lessons learned can be consolidated and
formulated as a set of criteria to help guide the
definition of sustainable development goals and
targets and embed environmental sustainability in the
SDGs. These criteria are presented in Section 9.
Second, existing goals and targets can be taken as a
“ground floor” for the SDGs, that is, they can be used
as a reference point to make sure that new objectives
are stronger. Certainly the international community

12

cannot afford to backtrack on its ambitions to
protect biodiversity, mitigate climate change, restore
freshwater ecosystems, and otherwise promote
environmental sustainability . In fact, governments in
Rio+20 confirmed that the SDGs should “build upon
commitments already made”. 44
Third, the SDGs should take on some of the
unfinished business of current goals and targets by
incorporating in some form a limited number that are
particularly important and whose implementation
can be accelerated if they are included in the SDGs.
It was mentioned in Section 2 that mitigating climate
change, reducing indoor air pollution, slowing the loss
of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and lessening
the risk of species extinction are examples of goals
making slow progress. Besides stimulating their
implementation, the inclusion of existing goals and
targets in SDGs might lend weight to their adoption
by the UN General Assembly. In addition, there are
precedents for including the same or similar goals
in two different treaties, as in the case of MDG-7
which has a qualitative objective for “reducing the
consumption of ozone depleting substances” similar
to the quantitative objective for reducing these
substances in the Montreal Protocol.
While some current goals and targets should be
included in the new SDGs this does not mean that
SDGs should only cover current goals and targets. In
fact they should also consider the many emerging
issues not covered by current agreements.
Another important point is that it will be neither
feasible nor necessary to try and incorporate all current
goals and targets in SDGs. For example, many focus on
regional or sub-regional issues and may therefore not
be appropriate for the global and “universal” focus of
the SDGs.

Version 2 19 July 2013

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Part B. A Framework for Embedding Environment in SDGs
6. Introducing a Framework for
Embedding Environment in the SDGs

•	 A set of criteria for assessing or proposing goals and
targets, and guidance on how to use them (Section 9);
•	 A list of best practices for selecting indicators that
can effectively support targets. (Section 10)

What framework can be used for embedding
environment in the SDGs?
We have seen up to this point that current
international environmental goals have made some,
but limited, progress in achieving their targets. This
was an important factor in the decision at Rio+20 to
call for goals for sustainable development rather than
just development. These SDGs have the dual purpose
of increasing human wellbeing through development
while protecting and strengthening the ecosystem
services that underpin this wellbeing.
Recalling the aim of this Paper, we now ask, how
can the environment be embedded in the SDGs? A
four‑point framework can be used for this task:
•	 A rationale and overarching vision for the SDGs,
which is a narrative describing the basis for
including environmental sustainability in SDGs
(Section 7);
•	 An integrated approach to embedding environment in goals and targets which proposes basic
characteristics and types of goals and targets to be
selected (Section 8);

The framework is depicted in Figure 1 and described in
the following sections.

7. Rationale and Overarching Vision
What is the rationale and overarching vision for
embedding the environment in the SDGs?
Countries at the Rio+20 Conference set an overarching
vision for the SDGs, stating that they should “address
and incorporate in a balanced way all three dimensions
of sustainable development and their interlinkages.”
Furthermore, the SDGs “should be coherent with…
the United Nations Development Agenda beyond
2015” and be “action-oriented, concise and easy to
communicate, limited in number, aspirational, global
in nature and universally applicable to all countries
while taking into account different national realities…”.
They should also be “consistent with international law
[and] build upon commitments already made”.

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

In line with the purpose of this Paper, it is appropriate
to ask at this juncture, what is the rationale for
embedding environment in the SDGs?
•	 Environment is a prerequisite for socio-economic
development. We know, for example, that the
viability of agriculture depends on the condition
of its ecological foundation, including healthy
off-farm and on-farm biodiversity. Fish harvests
are similarly underpinned by an ecological basis
including healthy coral reefs and delta ecosystems
which provide vital habitat for fish and their
associated food web. Nature also provides basic
inputs to the economy such as water, building
materials, energy and fuels, textiles, productive
soils, navigation routes for our trade, and offers
livelihoods in forestry, fisheries, and agriculture.
•	 Human health and wellbeing depends on good
environmental quality. Conversely, the absence
of good environmental quality in the form of
contaminated water or polluted air endangers our
health and wellbeing.
•	 Environment has intrinsic values. Over and above
the preceding justifications, the integrity of the
environment is important in itself because nature
has educational, cultural, recreational, aesthetic,
religious, spiritual and other intrinsic values.
Taken together, these benefits are part of the vast
collection of natural resources and vital “ecosystem
services”, underpinned by biodiversity, that sustain
the existence of humanity.
It is clear that environmental changes and policies
deeply influence development. But the relationship
between development and the environment has not
been favourable up to now since the payment for a
higher standard of living has been the steady depletion
of natural resources and increasing environmental
impact. A key challenge to the SDGs, then, is how to
“decouple” socio-economic development from this
overuse of resources and growing environmental
degradation (See Criterion 2 in Section 9).
With the above points in mind, it is apparent that
a fundamental and transformative change in our
thinking will be needed to increase the wellbeing45

of all people, including future generations, while
maintaining the integrity of ecosystems and the earth
system. It follows that the SDGs must be profound and
not incremental, but at the same time specific enough
to trigger and sustain the necessary shift in thinking.
Good governance will play a particularly important
role in realizing these goals.

8. An Integrated Approach to
Embedding Environment in SDGs
What is an appropriate approach to embedding
environment in SDGs? What kind of goals and targets
and other elements are part of this approach?
In this section we examine a systematic approach
to embedding environment in goals and targets.
The approach covers the basic characteristics and
types of the goals and targets to be selected. The
approach was selected after an expert group (see
Acknowledgements) evaluated three alternative
approaches (See Annex).
The approach consists of integrated goals, underpinned
by mixed targets, which in turn are supported by
clear, measurable indicators (Figure 2). The goals and
targets work together as a coherent set to fulfil the
objectives of sustainable development. In addition, a
set of criteria (described in Section 9) helps to ensure
that the environment is embedded in the goals and
targets. The elements of the approach are described
in the following paragraphs.

8.1.	 A Complementary Set of Goals and Targets
An important principle for selecting goals and targets
is that they should add up to a set of objectives (goals
and targets) that reinforce and complement each
other.
In the first place, they should as a whole cover the
minimum objectives of the environmental, social
and economic aspects of sustainable development.
The criteria in Section 9 (“Criteria for Embedding
Environmental Sustainability in SDGs”) can be used
to test if environmental sustainability is adequately
incorporated in goals and targets.

But this complementarity is not likely to happen
automatically. One of the strongest lessons drawn
from current goals is that extra effort must be made to
make this happen. Otherwise actions to achieve one
goal might undermine the achievement of another
goal. As an example, it was pointed out in Part A of
this Paper that the lack of harmony between the
socio-economic and environmental objectives of the
MDGs has lowered their effectiveness. It is essential,
therefore, to maximize the complementarity of the
goals and targets if the SDGs are to have their desired
impact.
To assess the level of complementarity, SDG developers
can test a particular set of goals and targets against
the yardsticks presented in Section 9 (under “Using
the Framework and Criteria, Option 1, Step 1b).

8.2.	 Integrated Goals

16

An integrated approach to SDGs has, at the top level,
a limited number of integrated goals that are simple
to understand and communicate, but not necessarily
simple in nature. They are likely to be aspirational and
qualitative, so that they are translatable, flexible, and

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

have an easier chance of gaining broad acceptance.
The goals would be “integrated” in the sense that they
embody all three aspects of sustainable development
– environmental, social and economic (e.g. “Ensure
sustainable food and nutrition security worldwide”).
A useful characteristic of goals was mentioned earlier
and is repeated here, namely that goals should focus
more on driving forces leading to positive outcomes
(“expand sustainable agriculture” or “increase the
efficiency of the food system”) rather than the positive
outcomes themselves (“secure food supply” or “lower
occurrence of malnutrition”). The reasoning is that
focusing on driving forces rather than outcomes leads
to a more direct pathway to solving a problem or
achieving a goal.
Examples of integrated goals are presented in Box 2.
Section 11 lists some of the advantages of developing
integrated rather than single dimensional goals.

8.3.	 A Mix of Targets
The previous section emphasizes that in setting goals
it is important to consider the interlinkages among the
various dimensions of sustainable development, and
therefore the need for integrated goals. The question
is, does this also apply to the targets that underpin the
goals? Should targets also be integrated?

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Box 2. Examples of goals and targets using an “integrated” approach. Presented for illustration only.
Example Integrated Goal 1. Ensure worldwide food and nutrition security through (i) adequate nutrition for all, (ii) equitable access for all to food supplies, and (iii) expansion of environmentally sustainable fisheries and agriculture .
Example Targets
Integrated Target 1.1
Increase access to food and reduce the environmental consequences of food production by reducing food loss and waste by XX%
by 2025.
Integrated Target 1.2
Expand the coverage of early warning systems for food shortfalls from XX to YY countries by 2025 in order to provide a more reliable food supply system and as an aid to climate change adaptation.
Non-Integrated Target 1.3
Increase access to sufficient, safe, affordable, and nutritious food, thereby reducing the absolute number of children suffering
from malnutrition from XX to YY% by 2025.46
Non-integrated Target 1.4
Phase out subsidies and incentives by 2025 that are harmful to the continuous ability of ecosystems to produce food and fish.
Non-integrated Target 1.5
Expand the coverage of sustainable agriculture and fisheries by:
-	 increasing the area of land under sustainable agriculture from XX% to YY% by 202547;
-	 ensuring that XX% of fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, by 2025; 48
-	 reducing by XX% the environmental pollution caused by agricultural fertilizers by 2025.49

Example Integrated Goal 2. Achieve sustainable energy for all through delivery of energy that is (i) affordable and accessible to all, (ii) creates green jobs, (iii) minimizes health risks, and (iv) minimizes environmental degradation and resource
depletion.
Example Targets
Integrated Target 2.1
Increase the percentage of primary energy produced by sustainable energy sources from XX% to YY% by 2025.
Integrated Target 2.2
Reduce per capita worldwide energy consumption by XX% by 2025 through improvements in the energy efficiency of the building,
industrial, agricultural, and transportation sectors worldwide.
Non-integrated Target 2.3
Increase the percentage of households with access to renewable electricity from XX% to YY% by 2025.
Non-integrated Target 2.4
Reduce the average worldwide water used per KwH from XX to YY by 2025.
Non-integrated Target 2.5
Phase out XX% of inefficient subsidies that result in wasteful energy consumption by 202550.
Non-integrated Target 2.6

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

One answer is that as many of the targets as possible
should be integrated, for the same reasons as above.
Another answer is that it may not be possible to come
up with a complete set of integrated targets because
they should also be specific and measurable. Indeed,
these two criteria have apparently played a key role in
the success of current targets (see Part A, Experience
with Global Environmental Goals) because they
encourage countries to compile the necessary data
for tracking their progress. This in turn, has helped
countries raise support internally and externally for
meeting their targets.
But being specific and measurable and being integrated
are not necessarily compatible because integrated
targets can be difficult to interpret and measure. In
some cases they may be suitable as qualitative and
aspirational goals, but perhaps not as targets.
The conclusion, therefore, is that each of the
integrated goals should be underpinned by a mix of
targets – some integrated, and some “non-integrated”
(in that they concentrate on either environmental,
social or economic objectives) (Figure 1). Examples are
given in Box 2.
To sum up, integrated targets are preferable because
they acknowledge the interlinkages between
environmental, social and economic dimensions of
sustainable development, and have other strengths
given in Section 11 for integrated goals. But to avoid
their weaknesses, integrated targets should only be
used if they are:
•	 specific enough to be easily understood.
•	 measurable under current or feasible measurement programmes.

9. Criteria for Embedding Environmental
Sustainability in SDGs
What criteria can be used for embedding environmental sustainability in SDGs?
Up to this point, this Paper has described the type of
goals and targets that would make up an “integrated
approach” for structuring SDGs. How then can
we ensure that these goals and targets embed
environmental sustainability? How can we draw on

18

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

experience with current environmental objectives to
help with this task? Based upon the lessons discussed
in Sections 2 (“Experience with Global Environmental
Goals”), the following criteria are given as a guide
for embedding environment in SDGs. As would be
explained in Section 9.3, the criteria can be used for
either assessing or deriving goals and targets.
While these criteria were developed with environmental sustainability in mind, they also apply in
some cases to the social and economic dimensions of
sustainable development.

9.1.	 Overview of Suggested Criteria
The six criteria are:
I.	 Strong linkage with developmental goals. Within
the SDGs environmental issues should be strongly
linked to socio-economic developmental issues.
The SDGs should “incorporate in a balanced way all
three dimensions of sustainable development and
their inter-linkages” (Rio+20 Outcome Document).
Perhaps the most fruitful way to couple
environment and socio-economic development
within the SDGs is to formulate integrated goals
and targets, as previously described.
II.	 Decoupling of socio-economic development
from escalating resource use and environmental
degradation. Goals and targets should be
formulated to promote the decoupling of socioeconomic development from unsustainable
depletion of resources and increasing environmental impact.
III.	 Coverage of critical issues of environmental
sustainability such as important irreversible
changes in the global environment. The final
set of selected goals and targets should cover as
many critical environmental sustainability issues
(current and imminent) as possible. Priority should
be given to objectives that help avoid critical
“irreversible” changes of the global environment.
IV.	 Take into account current and global environmental goals and targets. This can be done by:
(a) using current goals and targets as a “ground
floor” for new goals and targets; (b) incorporating
a small number of important current goals and
targets whose implementation can be accelerated
if they are included in the SDGs.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

V.	 Scientifically credible and verifiable. Goals and
	

targets should be based on best scientific understanding and support should be available from the
scientific community to monitor and implement
them.

VI.	 Progress must be “trackable”. All goals should be
backed up by specific and measurable targets and
indicators.

9.2.	 Explanation of Criteria
Criterion 1. Strong linkage with developmental goals.
The Rio+20 Outcome Document suggests that
developmental issues should be a strong guiding force
for new SDGs and that biodiversity and ecosystem
services are important to sustainable development.
It follows that environmental sustainability within
the SDGs should have a direct link to socioeconomic issues leading to greater wellbeing such
as poverty eradication. In the same vein, individual
environmental goals/targets under the SDG umbrella
must be coupled and consistent with each other. As
mentioned earlier, this is one of the strongest lessons
coming from experience with existing environmental
goals and targets.
An effective way to integrate environment and socioeconomic development is to bring them together in
the form of integrated goals and targets as explained
in Section 8 (“An Integrated Approach to Embedding
Environment in SDGs”).
Criterion 2. Decoupling of socio-economic development from escalating resource use and environmental degradation.
In Section 7 (“Rationale and Overarching Vision”)
it was noted that a key to achieving environmental
sustainability is to decouple the traditional relationship

between socio-economic development and depletion
of resources and increasing environmental impact.51
An important way to decouple this relationship
is to increase resource efficiency along the entire
production chain. Indeed, there is strong evidence
that the potential is still huge for improving the
efficiency of using energy, water, and production
materials, including metals and other commodities.52
For example less than one-third of some 60 metals
studied have an end-of-life recycling rate above 50 per
cent, and 34 metals have a recycling rate below one
per cent, including many valuable rare earths53.
But decoupling cannot be achieved by just improving
technical efficiency since there are upper limits to
these improvements and they can occasionally even
stimulate higher consumption. To be effective these
improvements need to be accompanied by shifts
to more sustainable consumption and production
patterns. In the energy sector, for example, a
combination of increasing energy efficiency, together
with lower levels of energy use, and a replacement of
fossil fuels with renewable energy sources will finally
put society on a sustainable energy path.
Criterion 3. Coverage of critical issues of environmental sustainability such as irreversible changes in
the global environment.
As noted in Section 2 (“Experience with Global
Environmental Goals”), the current MDGs only cover
a limited part of the environmental sustainability
spectrum. On one hand, since environment is a key
aspect of sustainable development, the SDGs should
cover as much of this spectrum as possible.
On the other hand, the SDGs should also be “limited
in number”54 and it is certainly not possible to
include each and every environmental sustainability
issue. Hence, an urgent task is to identify a priority

	 During the 20th century the annual extraction of construction minerals grew by a factor of 34, ores and minerals by a factor of 27, fossil fuels by a factor of 12,
biomass by a factor of 3.6, and total material extraction by a factor of about eight, while GDP rose 23-fold. See UNEP 2012. Responsible resource management
for a sustainable world: findings from the International Resource Panel. UNEP. http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Portals/24102/SYNOPSIS%20Final%20

some groundwater sources, and of course many other environmental impacts.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

list of issues.55 Precedence here should be given
to environmental problems currently critical or
increasing in intensity such as growing air and water
pollution in developing countries, which is leading to
risks to public health and food security.56
Another priority class of issues are irreversible
environmental problems. Some environmental
problems are only reversible over the time scale
of decades, centuries, or even longer. These are
sometimes labelled “irreversible” since they seem
irreversible over generations or lifetimes. In the case
of the extinction of species, they are truly irreversible.
These changes are sometimes associated with an
environmental system moving from their current state
to one having no precedent in human experience, as
in the case of shifting vegetation zones brought on by
long term temperature and precipitation changes.
Some authors57 have recommended that irreversible
problems be given special attention in the SDGs
because they imply impacts that cannot be ameliorated and may be difficult to adapt to.
Furthermore, on the large scale, some of these
changes imply a dangerous tampering with the earth
system, or “tipping points”. One example is the case
of global warming which can lead to a chain of events
such as the melting of Arctic permafrost, which
releases methane gas, which further stimulates global
warming and further melting, and so on.58
The idea of irreversible problems is also connected
to the notions of “planetary boundaries” and
“safe operating space”59 because socio-economic
development cannot proceed indefinitely if it causes
irreversible environmental changes on a large scale. It
is easy to imagine how this development will be selflimiting if it causes major shifts in rainfall patterns,

20

collapses of fisheries, contamination of soils, and
other kinds of irreversible changes noted below.
There are many different categories of irreversible
problems that should be considered for the SDGs.
One category involves changes associated with
climate change or other consequences of the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere such as
large scale changes in rainfall patterns, more frequent
extreme weather events or acidification of the oceans.
Also included here are the irreversible outcomes of
climate impacts including the melting of the Arctic ice
cap and conversions of forested areas to grassland.
Another category has to do with irreversible changes,
such as the diminishment of coral reefs, which are (or
will be) caused by a combination of climate change
and other pressures of society such as water pollution
and/or development in coastal areas.
Yet another category of irreversible processes are
mostly due to non-climate pressures from society such
as the collapse of fisheries (overfishing), biodiversity
loss including the accelerated extinction of species
(over-harvesting and/or destruction of habitat), and
the build-up of persistent organic pollutants in soils
and water (pesticide application and atmospheric
emissions of chemicals).
Some targets could aim at mitigating these problems
(e.g. habitat protection in order to lower risk of species
extinctions), while others could focus on early warning
of their occurrence (e.g. monitoring programmes to
detect methane releases from permafrost melting).
Moreover, the precautionary approach provides a
strong argument for acting on these problems, even
if uncertainty is high. This was the case with ozone
depletion in the upper atmosphere, in which countries
decided to act despite initial scientific uncertainties.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
55
	 To develop this priority list, it would be helpful to first draw up a compact inventory of environmental sustainability issues. This inventory can then be further
compressed into a small priority list based on criteria such as urgency, persistence, impact on the earth system, and size of population and area affected or
likely to be affected.

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Criterion 4. Take into account current global environmental goals and targets.
As explained in Section 2 (“Lessons Learned from a
Review of Environmental Goals and Targets”), there
are hundreds of international environmental treaties
and agreements and they contain a wide range of
goals and targets which occupy the attention of the
international community. Forging ahead with new
SDGs while ignoring the existing web of goals and
targets may create a situation in which countries are
confronted with overlapping, and even contradictory
goals. This would increase the burden on countries
already struggling to track and comply with numerous
environmental treaties. Hence, current goals and
targets should be accounted for in some way in
SDGs. Moreover, by being part of SDGs, current
environmental goals would be coupled to important
objectives of socio-economic development. In this
way they could win additional support for their
implementation from parts of government not usually
concerned with environmental goals. Being embedded
within the SDGs could also help to maintain attention
on current environmental goals beyond their present
time horizons.
But it will be neither feasible nor necessary to
incorporate all current environmental objectives.
For example, some focus on regional or sub-regional
issues and perhaps are not very relevant to the global
and “universal” scope of the SDGs.
Some ideas were presented in Section 5 on how to
take into account current goals:
First, existing goals and targets can be used as a “ground
floor” for the SDGs; this would mean that proposals for
SDGs would be compared to existing goals and targets
to make sure that new objectives are, at the minimum,
equal to current objectives. As noted earlier, the international community cannot afford to backtrack on
its ambitions to protect biodiversity, mitigate climate
change, restore freshwater and marine ecosystems,
and otherwise promote environmental sustainability.

Second, a limited number of current goals and targets
could be incorporated in some fashion in SDGs, in
particular, the ones whose implementation could be
accelerated if they are included in the SDGs.
An important body of targets that falls within this
context is the set of 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets
adopted in 2010 as part of the Strategic Plan for
Biodiversity under the Convention on Biological
Diversity. These targets, particularly the first four, are
closely linked to socio-economic development issues.
Efforts are underway to connect these targets to the
SDGs, and this work should be taken into account
to avoid duplication and ensure policy coherence.60
Other Multilateral Environmental Agreements also
have targets related to development issues, and these
should also be factored into the SDG process.
Criterion 5. Scientifically credible and verifiable.
All goals and targets should be scientifically credible
and verifiable. They should be backed up with
enough scientific capacity to support data collection,
monitoring of progress and other tasks necessary
for the implementation of the goal or target. This
means that it is important to engage the scientific
community in developing the SDGs. Scientists can
also provide advice on possible targets for monitoring
emerging issues not yet validated by science, and
on “sustainability science” targets for bolstering the
science needed to meet the sustainability challenge.
It is worth noting that scientific credibility is not
as straightforward as it may seem. On one hand,
developers of SDGs can use traditional benchmarks to
judge credibility. For example, it is commonly assumed
that findings about an issue are credible if they are
published in several peer-reviewed technical journals.
On the other hand, it is also accepted that traditional
knowledge, citizen-science, and “qualitative” knowledge have a role to play in sustainable development issues.61 Since the issue of how society reckons
credibility is not likely to be resolved very soon,
developers of SDGs should work closely with scientists

Development Goals (SDGs): Ecosystem goods and services for human wellbeing” - Background paper for the Trondheim Conference 27-31 May 2013. CBD

For example, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment used multiple knowledge systems including the disciplines of conventional science, practitioner (or
assessment user) knowledge, and local/traditional knowledge. See Ericksen and Woodley. 2005. Using multiple knowledge systems: beneﬁts and challenges.

and other knowledgeable people to assess the
credibility of issues on a case-by-case basis.
The issue of scientific credibility of proposed SDGs as
well as the monitoring of their progress once adopted
could be taken up by existing science-policy platforms
such as the IPBES (Intergovernmental Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) or the IPCC
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
Criterion 6. Progress must be “trackable”.
This is a strong recommendation coming from many
reports and a clear lesson from existing goals. Success
in achieving goals seems to depend on whether
society can show progress, and this requires specific
and measurable targets and indicators and adequate
monitoring of these indicators. As mentioned earlier,
this does not imply that data for indicators must
already be available. It is possible that some goals may
require new measurable targets and indicators, and
new efforts to acquire data. Section 10 (“Indicators
for Tracking Progress on Goals and Target”) addresses
various issues associated with indicators.

1.	 Are the most important objectives of the
environmental, social and economic aspects of
sustainable development covered by the set?
2.	 Are there significant gaps in coverage?
3.	 Will the goals and targets work as a set to maintain
and restore the ecosystem services necessary to
meet social and economic objectives?
4.	 Related to the preceding, are the social and
economic objectives embedded in the goals
and targets compatible with environmental
sustainability?
5.	 Are goals or targets in one sector (e.g. food and
nutrition) complementary to those in other
sectors (e.g. health)?

9.3.	 Using the Framework and Criteria

Step 1c. Integrated goals and mixed targets
We then ask, Are the goals and at least some of the
targets integrated? Information about integrated
goals and targets from Section 8 would be used to
address this question.

How can the framework be used in the SDG
development process? Two step-by-step options are
presented here. Option 1 uses the criteria to assess
existing goals and targets, and Option 2 for deriving
new goals and targets.

Step 1d. Criteria for embedding environmental
sustainability
Next, we ask, According to the criteria in Section
9.2, do the goals and targets embed environmental
sustain-ability in an adequate way?

Option 1. Assessing proposed goals and
targets

Examining the goals and targets against these criteria
would give some indication of the degree to which they
incorporate ideas about environmental sustainability
and its linkage to socio-economic development.

One option is to use the framework to assess goals
and targets already proposed in the SDG discussion
process. Many different constituencies have already
proposed objectives (See Box 1) and these could
be evaluated to determine how well they embody
environmental sustainability.
Step 1a. Overarching vision and rationale.
We first ask, Do the proposed goals and targets fit
within the rationale and overarching vision (Section 7)
for the SDGs?

22

Integrated Approach to Embedding Environment in
SDGs”). We begin by asking, Are the goals and targets
complementary? To address this question we can use
the following yardsticks:

Step 1b. The complementarity of the goals and
targets
Next, we examine if the entire set of goals follows
the integrated approach laid out in Section 8 (“An

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

Step 1e. Supporting Indicators
Finally, we address the question, Are the indicators
proposed for these goals and targets consistent with
guidelines for best practice presented in Section 10
(“Tracking Progress on Goals and Targets”)?

Option 2. Formulating new goals and targets
The framework can also be used to formulate new
goals and targets for the SDG discussion process. In
this case, the following steps would be followed:

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Step 2a. Integrated goals
We first ask, what are integrated goals that comply
with Criteria 1 through 6?
A possible approach is to come up with an initial list
of goals by using Criteria 1 through 4. In other words,
identifying goals: (i) that have a strong linkage to
socio-development, (ii) that promote the decoupling
of socio-economic development from escalating
resource use and environmental degradation,
(iii) that cover critical issues of environmental
sustainability including irreversible changes in the
global environment, (iv) that do not show a retreat
from current goals and targets, and finally, (v) that
account for a small number of important current
goals and targets whose implementation could be
accelerated if they are included in the SDGs. From
the beginning it should be kept in mind that the goals
should be integrated and simple-to-understand, as
described in Section 8 (“An Integrated Approach to
Embedding Environment in SDGs”), and should fit
into the rationale and overarching vision for the SDGs
(Section 7).
After an initial group of integrated goals is drawn
up, this group can be tested against Criterion 5 –
scientifically credible and verifiable. Criterion 6 first
becomes important when we consider targets.
Step 2b. A mix of targets
As a next step we ask, what is the appropriate mix of
integrated and non-integrated targets that underpin
the preliminary list of goals?
We use Criteria 1 through 6 to formulate these targets.
Similar to our approach for setting goals, we come
up with a preliminary list of targets using Criteria
1 through 4, and then test this list against Criteria 5
through 6. Now Criterion 6 (“All goals should be backed
up by specific and measurable targets and indicators” )
comes into play.
In selecting targets we keep in mind the suggestions
for types of targets from Section 8 (“An Integrated
Approach to Embedding Environment in SDGs”}
and select a set of integrated and non-integrated
targets appropriate for each of the goals. We recall
that integrated targets are preferable because
they acknowledge the interlinkages between

environmental, social and economic dimensions of
sustainable development, and for other reasons. But
to avoid their weaknesses, integrated targets should
only be selected if they are:
•	 specific enough to be easily understoo d
•	 measurable under current or feasible measurement programmes
Otherwise single-dimensional goals (specific to
the environmental, social or economic concerns of
sustainable development) should be used.
Step 2c. A complementary set
After a preliminary set of goals and targets have been
compiled, the set as a whole is examined to determine
if it adds up to a set of objectives that reinforce and
complement each other. To address this, the same set
of questions as in Step 1b above can be used.
Step 2d. Supporting Indicators
Appropriate indicators for the goals and targets can
then be selected with the help of the guidelines for
best practice in Section 10 (“Tracking Progress on
Goals and Targets”).
There are, of course, other options for using the
framework. For example, the six criteria from this
Paper can be combined with their equivalents from
the social and economic aspects of sustainable
development, and the combined criteria can be used
to formulate goals and targets that reflect all three
dimensions of sustainable development.

10. Indicators for Tracking Progress on
Goals and Targets
Countries made it clear at Rio+20 that “progress
towards the achievement of the SDGs needs to be
assessed and accompanied by targets and indicators…”
In this section, we review best practices and other
considerations in selecting these indicators.
Generally speaking, indicators are measures that
can be used to illustrate and communicate complex
phenomena relevant to the environment in a simple
way, including trends over time. In the case of the
SDGs they will facilitate tracking of whether targets
and goals are being met and will indicate if corrective
actions are required (e.g. redefining targets).

Version 2 19 July 2013

23

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Here we review some of the basics of selecting
indicators to track progress in achieving targets.
Although the focus is on environmental indicators,
many conclusions also pertain to social and economic
indicators. That being said, some environmental
indicators do differ from social and economic
indicators, for example, by having greater spatial
coverage or requiring special measuring techniques.

10.1.	Recommended Characteristics of
Indicators in the SDGs
Although a complete discussion of desirable characteristics of indicators is outside the scope of this Paper,
here is a short list of recommendations:
•	 The set of indicators for monitoring SDGs should be
limited in number and be coherent, i.e. consistent
and complementary to each other within and
between goals and targets. This is elaborated in
the last point below.
•	 Indicators, just like targets, should be specific and
measureable. As has been noted earlier, this is a
clear lesson coming from existing environmental
objectives.62
•	 They should be understandable, clear and
unambiguous in their interpretation.
•	 Indicators should be clearly linked to targets
and be robust in providing measures of progress
towards achieving targets.
•	 They should be relevant to policy making and
should change in response to policy interventions.
•	 Indicators selected for the purpose of the SDGs
should avoid duplication by being consistent with
indicators used by other agreements.
•	 Where possible, they should be linked to recognized
cost-effective tracking and monitoring systems to
establish their credibility and comparability, and to
allow for meaningful analyses by countries.
•	 The mix of indicators for each target might include
both absolute and relative changes. In addition,
collected data should be disaggregated by income
group, gender, location etc., in order to give a more
complete picture of performance and support
socially inclusive and equitable development.

24

•	 A baseline year for the indicator should be set
in order to make progress between targets
comparable.
•	 The interlinkages between indicators of biophysical state as well as relationships with socioeconomic drivers and impacts should be included.
These relationships among indicators, and the
links between goals, targets and indicators could
be mapped out explicitly to provide a coherent and comparable framework for measuring
progress of different goals and targets. Such a
mapping exercise would also allow a better integration of the environment in the SDGs. As an
example, as mentioned earlier, there is a clear
link between targets and indicators for reducing
hunger and poverty on one side and protecting
biodiversity and ecosystem services on the other.

10.2.	Methodologies for Selecting Indicators
A transparent methodology should be used to
select indicators, rather than choosing them in an
ad hoc manner. The advantage of using a particular
methodology is that it will make it possible to explain
how the indicators were selected, and this may
increase their acceptance.
An example methodology is the “DPSIR approach”
(Drivers – Pressure –State– Impacts– Response)63. This
provides a simple visual model for organizing
large numbers of components that make up an
environmental system, from the socio-economic
driving forces of the system to the societal response to
undesirable environmental change. In the context of
the SDGs, a DPSIR diagram could be used to depict the
various factors involved in a goal or target together
with their interrelationships. Such a diagram would
help developers of SDGs visualize the most appropriate
indicators for tracking progress in reaching a target.

10.3.	Types of Sustainability Indicators
Here is a brief review of different types of indicators
related to sustainability issues and relevant to
underpinning targets.

	 Monitoring concrete goals with statistically robust indicators was considered an important strength of the MDG framework from both a policy as well as
statistical perspective. It has fostered the strengthening of statistical systems and the compilation and use of quality data to improve policy design and
monitoring by national governments and international organizations.

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Outcome and process indicators
The typical metric used for measuring progress is an
“impact/outcome” indicator, for example the “coverage
of protected areas”. In some cases, however, it is also
useful to employ “process” indicators that track the
rate of implementation of a target, for example the
“number of countries that have adopted a national plan
for reaching a target for coverage of protected areas”.
Qualitative indicators
Most indicators underlying current international
goals and targets are quantitative, which has the
advantage of making them measureable. But they
still may not cover all the areas needed for tracking
a target. From the MDGs we have learned that not
only quantitative indicators, but also “qualitative”
indicators of perception, satisfaction and attitude can
also be useful. These can also be measurable using
metrics from the social sciences.64
Composite indicators
In some cases it is convenient and feasible to consolidate
several indicators into a meaningful single index or
“composite indicator65”. These are combinations of
different parameters with different numerical scales,
weighted to provide a single value. Such composite
indicators could be useful for communicating the
state of SDG progress to a wide and varied audience
because they describe a complex system in a simple
way. However, to be accepted, information about the
indicator must be transparent – it must be clear which
parameters make up the composite index, and how
they are weighted (the related issue of strength and
weaknesses of composite goals and targets is taken up
in the Annex).
Examples of composite indicators related to
sustainability issues are: the Osberg and Sharpe’s
Index of Economic Well-Being; the Environmental
Sustainability Index; the Sustainable Measure of
Economic Welfare; the Index of Sustainable Economic
Welfare; the Genuine Progress Indicator; the Adjusted
Net Savings; and the Inclusive Wealth Index. A

comprehensive evaluation of the strengths and
weaknesses of these composite indicators is needed.
Topical indicators
Indicators can also be sorted according to the
sustainability-related topics they cover. For example,
a target for sustainable consumption and production
could be underpinned by various indicators of material
productivity and material consumption. In the context
of the SDGs, such indicators could focus on those
resources of critical importance to poverty eradication
and human welfare – e.g. energy, water, land and soil
fertility and biodiversity.
Another example is a target for the biosphere which
could include indicators of Net Primary Productivity
(NPP) - the net amount of solar energy converted to
plant organic matter through photosynthesis. The
NPP has been called a “common currency” for climate
change, ecological, and economic assessments. The
rate at which humans appropriate NPP is a powerful
aggregate measure of human impact on the biosphere.

10.4.	Data and Reporting Issues
Also of importance to setting targets and indicators are
issues of data availability, quality and comparability.
At the beginning of this section it was advised that goals
should be backed by specific and measurable targets
and indicators. But the point was also made that it
was desirable, but not necessary for indicator data to
be currently available. In other words, the setting of
goals and targets should not be data-driven or limited
to those that are already backed up by databases for
tracking progress. This is reasonable because only a few
key environmental indicators are regularly monitored
and reported at the global level.66 However, provision
should then be made for acquiring the necessary data
after the goals and targets are adopted.
Two other points are worth noting here. First, for the
sake of credibility and accountability, it is desirable to
have a well established baseline of the indicator so

that progress in achieving goals and targets can be
measured. Second, because SDGs should incorporate
economic, social and environmental aspects of
sustainable development, it follows that a very broad
range of data will be needed for their monitoring and
implementation. A UN-wide effort, also involving
outside partners, could help to make these data
available.
Despite the large number of existing initiatives
to collect environmental information at all levels,
important gaps still remain, and the capabilities of
countries to acquire and process data continues to
vary greatly. It is to be expected that new demands
for data connected to the SDGs will put further
pressure on countries to expand their data collection
capabilities. But increasing the capacity of countries to
collect, compile and analyse data, and to do so in an
integrated fashion for different environmental issues
will yield great gains. Countries would be able to track
SDG progress and better compare their progress with
other countries. This could consequently encourage
them to meet targets.
A related challenge is that countries use different
methods, definitions and data sources which makes
the comparability of data a problem. With this in mind,
it would be useful if the SDG process would include
support for the harmonization of data.
In addition to the preceding issues about data, there
is also the question about who should be involved in
data collection. First of all, it is clear that indicator
data should be collected and reported by legitimate
institutions such as statistical offices. Since many
of the environmental indicators may be geospatial
in nature, the involvement of global and national
observing systems is also important. In addition,
universities, research institutions, and citizen scientists
have a role to play by helping to develop and test new
methodologies to acquire and analyse data.
In closing, we briefly raise two issues related to the
reporting of progress in achieving targets.
The first issue relates to the international and national
“architecture” of how data are processed and
delivered, including robust independent systems for
measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV). The

26

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

advice here is to spend adequate time to carefully plan
this architecture once the SDGs have been identified.
This is because a good design can save considerable
resources. One of many options to be considered
is to link the SDG architecture in some way to
current reporting institutions within the Multilateral
Environmental Agreements.
The second issue relates to maintaining the legitimacy
and credibility of progress reports. A simple idea
is to make the data behind the indicators widely
accessible. Another is to disseminate descriptions of
the techniques used to obtain and process the data.
To sum up, following the advice in this section will
increase the usefulness of indicators in achieving
sustainable development goals.

11. Strengths and Weaknesses of
the Framework
To recapitulate, this Paper proposes an “integrated”
approach for structuring SDGs in the form of a
complementary set of integrated goals, underpinned
by a mix of some integrated and non-integrated targets,
in turn supported by clear, measurable indicators
(Section 8). This approach, plus the “rationale and
overarching vision for the SDGs” (Section 7) and
a set of criteria for ensuring that environmental
sustainability is included in SDGs (Section 9), make up
the framework presented in this Paper.
Some weaknesses of the framework and what to do
about them are:
•	 Pursuing integrated goals and targets requires
a shift in thinking in government, business and
other institutions. It requires exceptional visionary
leaders, in particular at the national and subnational levels, who are able to synthesize the
environmental, social and economic concerns of
sustainable development
	

But leaders can and do learn. And a new generation of leaders is being trained in modern
interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary thinking and
may be better equipped than their predecessors
to deal with the sustainability challenge.
•	 An integrated approach to goals and targets will
probably require a high level of intersectoral

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

coordination at the national and local level in order
to reach simultaneous environmental, economic
and social objectives.
	

On the other hand, the challenge of meeting
integrated targets may have the positive effect
of encouraging governments to take into account
the interlinkages between the three dimensions of
sustainable development.
•	 Integrated goals and targets may be more difficult
to understand than those that limit themselves
to either the environmental, social or economic
aspects of sustainable development.
	

But this can be allayed by keeping the goals simple
and qualitative.
•	 Integrated targets may require new aggregated
metrics and new monitoring programmes to track.
Nevertheless, it is likely that even targets focusing
only on environmental, social or economic aspects
of sustainable development will require an
expansion of current measuring and monitoring
efforts. Furthermore, experience has shown that
means of measurement are developed once the
political commitment is clear.
Strengths of the framework include:
•	 Developing integrated goals, as opposed to single
dimensional goals, achieves a higher level of

integration of the three dimensions of sustainable
development. It acknowledges the fact that these
dimensions are intricately linked. Integrated
goals will also help ensure that all dimensions of
sustainable development are well represented in
the set of SDGs, as called for at Rio+20.
•	 Above, it was taken as a weakness that governments and other institutions will have to shift their
thinking and improve their internal coordination
in order to deal with integrated goals and targets.
But this is actually a strength since integrated goals
will encourage governments and other institutions
to move away from the silo approach, and will
prompt a more coordinated policy response to the
three dimensions of sustainable development.
•	 Giving the environment equal footing to social
and economic considerations within integrated
goals conveys the message that environmental
sustainability and investing in environmental
goods and services provides a foundation for
socio-economic development. Conversely, it
recognizes that poor environmental quality leads
to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and
subsequent risks to socio-economic development.
It encourages a type of development that minimizes unintended environmental consequences
and strengthens adaptation and resilience to
environmental and other changes.

Annex. Deciding on an Integrated Approach
Before deciding on the “integrated approach”
described in Section 8, three other approaches were
evaluated. These were formulated in a very distinctive
way to accentuate their differences so as to make it
easier to assess their strengths and weaknesses.

Approach 1. Developmental goals with
nested environmental targets
Under this approach (Figure 1) the SDGs consist, at the
highest level, of a set of socio-economic developmental
goals (such as ensuring sustainable livelihoods,
decent jobs and equitable growth; or, ensuring quality
education and lifelong learning). Each developmental
goal is underpinned by specific environmental, social,
and/or economic targets.
This approach assumes that SDGs will be driven by
the aims of socio-economic development and a push
to increase human wellbeing, but that environmental
targets should be nested within these goals to ensure
that development is achieved under environmentally
sustainable conditions.
For example a goal on sustainable livelihoods, decent
jobs and equitable growth could be underpinned
by targets for increasing the number of green
jobs (environmental, economic), decreasing youth
unemployment (social) and providing universal access
to financial services and infrastructure (economic).
Similarly, a goal on quality education and lifelong
learning could be underpinned by targets for
incorporating environmental education into all levels of
educational curriculums worldwide (environmental),
increasing the number of children and youths with
access to primary and secondary education (social),
and increasing the total number of graduates in high
tech fields (economic).
Strengths of the approach:
•	 If each socio-developmental goal is assigned at
least one environmental target, then this approach
will convey the message that environmental
sustainability supports developmental goals.

28

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

•	 Nesting environmental targets within all
developmental goals may also help minimize
the unintended environmental consequences
and depletion of natural resources that usually
accompany development.
Weaknesses of the approach:
•	 It omits the environmental dimension of sustainable
development from the goals themselves and this
could encourage a continuation of the fragmented
approach towards meeting the sustainability
challenge. It does not adequately consider that
ecosystem services and a healthy biodiversity are
prerequisites for sustainable development.
•	 Not all environmental issues can be easily nested
within social and economic developmental
goals. For example, it will not be easy to assign
climate targets or biodiversity targets to a single
development goal because these issues cut across
many different developmental topics.
•	 The fact that environmental sustainability targets
are embedded within developmental goals, rather
than given equal weight to these goals, may give
the false impression that environment has a lower
priority.

Approach 2. Environmental goals on par
with social and economic goals
Approach 2 (Figure 1) consists of a mixed set of
environmental, economic, and social goals. Some goals
would emphasize social objectives (e.g. governance),
some economic (e.g. poverty reduction), and some
environmental (e.g. biodiversity conservation). Unlike
Approach 1, in which the goals are all socio-economic,
here the goals would consist of a set of segregated
environmental, social, and economic goals, all on a par
with each other.
Each environmental goal would only be underpinned
with environmental targets, economic goals with
economic targets, and social goals with social targets.

Version 2 19 July 2013

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

Strengths of the approach:
•	 It conveys the message that environmental
sustainability is as important as social and
economic sustainability.
•	 It increases the chances that major environmental
issues are covered since they are given more
prominence here in the form of goals, as compared
to Approach 1 where they are subsidiary targets.
•	 Since environmental goals are segregated from
economic and social goals, less institutional
coordination may be needed to achieve them, as
compared to Approaches 1 and 3 (to follow).
Weaknesses of the approach:
•	 The last “strength” listed above can also be viewed as
an important weakness – separating environmental
goals from economic and social goals perpetuates
the uncoordinated “silo” way of dealing with
development challenges, and this usually wastes
resources because of duplicative efforts.
•	 Related to the previous point, experience from
the MDGs (see Section 3) shows that segregating
environment from social and economic
considerations ignores crucial connections
between these different aspects of sustainable
development. For example, the MDG goal for
poverty alleviation is not linked to the MDG goal for
environment sustainability, even though poverty
reduction can only be achieved by maintaining or
restoring ecosystem services.
•	 It does not encourage transformative thinking
about how to combine the three dimensions of
sustainable development.

Approach 3. The composite approach
Under Approach 3 (Figure 1), the environmental, social
and economic dimensions of sustainable development
are blended into “composite” goals that use abstract
concepts such as “rights” or “resilience” to capture
the various dimensions of sustainable development.
In this approach composite goals would be
underpinned by composite targets. No goals or
targets focusing exclusively on environmental, social

30

or economic aspects would be allowed. In a sense,
this approach goes beyond the notion of pillars or
dimensions of sustainability.
An example composite goal would be “to increase
human resilience to negative changes or shocks”.
An example composite target underpinning this goal
would be to achieve a minimum value for the “human
development index” in all countries by a particular
date.
Strengths of the approach
•	 As compared to Approaches 1 and 2, this is
likely to better integrate the three dimensions of
sustainability because all three are incorporated in
every goal and target.
•	 Given their abstract nature, the goals in this
approach may be viewed as more aspirational and
universally applicable than the goals in Approaches
1 and 2.
•	 This approach is consistent with the belief that
transformative action is needed to meet the
sustainability challenge.
Weaknesses of the approach
•	 Since composite goals are based on abstract
concepts they are also more likely to be difficult to
understand and interpret.
•	 Since they are more abstract, they may require a
bigger shift in thinking on the part of governments
and other institutions than Approaches 1 and 2,
and may therefore be more difficult to implement.
•	 It will probably be a big challenge to come up
with a complete set of targets that are not only
composite, but also specific and measurable.
Throughout this paper it is argued that being
specific and measurable is crucial to the success of
targets.

Combining the approaches
Experts67 at a Roundtable Discussion examined the
three approaches and suggested combining them into
the “Integrated Approach” found in Section 8 of this
paper.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

UNEP Post-2015 Discussion Paper 1

Embedding the Environment in Sustainable Development Goals

From Approach 3, the idea is taken to have each goal
incorporate the environmental, social and economic
dimensions of sustainable development. But the
Integrated Approach also stipulates that the goals must
be simple to understand and communicate. Hence,
the three dimensions of sustainable development
are incorporated in a different way. While they are
“blended” in the composite goals of Approach 3, they
are “combined” in a recognizable way in the goals of
the Integrated Approach. Approach 3 produces goals
based on abstract concepts such as “resilience” and
“rights” which do not explicitly spell out the separate
dimensions of sustainable development. By contrast,
the Integrated Approach starts with themes such as
“energy security”, and explicitly describes the three
dimensions of this theme. For example, an integrated
goal would be “energy security which provides

affordable access to clean energy for all (economic,
social), creates green jobs (environmental, economic),
lowers the health risks of the energy system
(environmental, social), and minimizes environmental
degradation and resource depletion (environmental).”
Borrowing from Approaches 1 and 3, the goals in
the Integrated Approach are underpinned by a mix
of “integrated” targets (in that they incorporate
all aspects of sustainable development) and “nonintegrated” targets (in the sense that they pertain to
either environmental, social or economic aspects). The
advantage of a mix is that it allows either integrated or
non-integrated targets to be chosen, as long as they
are specific and measurable.
The strengths of the Integrated Approach are reviewed
in more detail in Section 11.
