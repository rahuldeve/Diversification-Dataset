Global warming facts
Because most global warming emissions remain in the atmosphere for decades or
centuries, the energy choices we make today greatly influence the climate our children
and grandchildren inherit. We have the technology to increase energy efficiency, significantly reduce these emissions from our energy and land use, and secure a high quality 	
of life for future generations. We must act now to reduce dangerous consequences.

Exploring the potential causes of increased storm intensity

urricanes, typhoons, and cyclones have
always bedeviled coasts, but global
warming may be making matters worse.
Sea level is rising and will continue to
rise as oceans warm and glaciers melt.
Rising sea level means higher storm surges, even
from relatively minor storms, which increases
coastal flooding and subsequent storm damage
along coasts. In addition, the associated heavy
rains can extend hundreds of miles inland, fur-	
ther increasing the risk of flooding.
	 Recent scientific evidence suggests a link
between the destructive power (or intensity) of
hurricanes and higher ocean temperatures, driven
in large part by global warming. With rapid population growth in coastal regions placing many
more people and structures in the path of these
tropical cyclones there is a much greater risk 	
of casualties, property damage, and financial
hardship when these storms make landfall.
Hurricane Behavior
Meteorologists use the term “tropical cyclone” 	
for a closed atmospheric circulation that forms
over a tropical or subtropical ocean. Once maximum sustained wind speed exceeds 74 miles per
hour these storms are called hurricanes in the
Atlantic Ocean, typhoons in the Pacific Ocean,
and cyclones elsewhere.

	 Many factors influence tropical cyclone
behavior, but three factors must be present for
them to intensify: warm ocean temperatures
(hurricanes can occur when surface ocean temperatures exceed about 79 degrees Fahrenheit 	
[26 degrees Celsius]), low vertical wind shear 	
(i.e., no strong change in wind speed or direction), and high humidity. As warm, moist air
rises, it lowers air pressure at sea level and draws
surrounding air inward and upward in a rotating pattern. As the water vapor-laden air spirals
in and rises to higher altitudes, it cools and
releases heat as it condenses to rain. This cycle
of evaporation and condensation brings the
ocean’s heat energy into the vortex, powering
the storm.
	 There are several natural factors that can
“put the brakes on” a tropical cyclone: moving
over colder ocean water; strong winds that churn
up colder ocean water; high wind shear that can
diminish or destroy the vortex; dry air migrating
to the hurricane’s core; and moving over land,
which creates high frictional drag and deprives
the storm of warm ocean “fuel.” But as long as
conditions are favorable, the storm will thrive.
The Effect of Global Warming

air rotates inward to the
center (or “eye”), then
rises to higher altitudes.
As warm, moist air rises,
the air cools and condenses to rain, releasing
heat. This cycle of evaporation and condensation
powers the storm.
