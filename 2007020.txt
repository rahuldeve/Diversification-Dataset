Background 

Summary 

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has employed its Fast Response Survey 
System (FRSS) to track access to information technology in schools and classrooms since 1994.  FRSS is 
designed to administer short, focused, issue-oriented surveys that place minimal burden on respondents 
and have a quick turnaround from data collection to reporting. Each year, with the exception of 2004, 
NCES has conducted a new nationally representative survey of public schools to gauge the changes in 
computer  and  Internet  availability,  based  on  measures  such  as  student-to-computer  ratio  and  the 
percentage of schools and classrooms with Internet connections.  As computers and the Internet became 
increasingly available in schools, the FRSS surveys were modified to address new issues, such as the use 
of new types of Internet connections to enhance connectivity.  Recent FRSS surveys on Internet access 
have been expanded to address other emerging issues.  The 2002 survey, for instance, included items on 
the use of technologies or procedures to prevent student access to inappropriate material on the Internet 
and the availability of teacher professional development on technology use in the classroom. The 2005 
survey included items on the use of Internet access to provide various opportunities and information for 
teaching and learning.  

 
This  report  presents  key  findings  from  the  2005  FRSS  survey  on  Internet  access  in  U.S. 
public  schools  and  selected  comparisons  with  data  from  previous  FRSS  Internet  surveys.    The  2005 
survey, designed to update data on the issues addressed in 2003 and ask about a few new issues, covered 
the following topics:  

 
 

 

 

 

school connectivity, including school and classroom access to the Internet, and types of 
connections; 

student  access  to  computers  and  the  Internet,  including  student-to-computer  ratio,  the 
provision  of  hand-held  computers  to  teachers  and  students,  and  laptop  computers 
available for loan to students;  

technologies and procedures to prevent student access to inappropriate material on the 
Internet; 

teacher  professional  development  on  how  to  integrate  the  use  of  the  Internet  into  the 
curriculum; and  

1 

 

  use of Internet access to provide various opportunities and information for teaching and 

learning.  

Questionnaires  for  the  survey  Internet  Access  in  U.S.  Public  Schools,  Fall  2005  were 
mailed to a representative sample of 1,205 public schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  
The  sample  was  selected  from 
the  200304  NCES  Common  Core  of  Data  (CCD)  Public 
Elementary/Secondary  School  Universe  File,  the  most  current  available  at  the  time  of  selection.    The 
sampling frame includes about 85,000 regular elementary and secondary/combined schools (a combined 
school is one that encompasses instruction at both the elementary and secondary levels).  The number of 
schools  in  the  survey  universe  decreased  to  an  estimated  83,000  after  some  of  the  schools  were 
determined  during  data  collection  to  have  been  closed  or  merged  with  other  schools.    Data  have  been 
weighted to yield national estimates.  The unweighted and weighted response rates were both 86 percent.  
Detailed information about the survey methodology is provided in appendix A, and the questionnaire can 
be  found  in  appendix  B.    The  focus  of  this  report  is  twofold:  the  national  estimates  for  2005,  and 
statistically significant findings over time.  Selected survey findings are presented by the following school 
characteristics: 

 
 

 

 

instructional level (elementary, secondary); 

school size (enrollment of less than 300, 300 to 999, 1,000 or more, referred to as small, 
medium, and large throughout the report); 

locale (city, urban fringe, town, rural);  

  percent  minority  enrollment  (less  than  6  percent,  6  to  20  percent,  21  to  49  percent, 

50 percent or more); and 

  percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (less than 35 percent, 35 to 
49 percent, 50 to 74 percent, 75 percent or more), which is used as a measure of poverty 
concentration at the school.  For the remainder of this report, we will refer to the percent 
of free or reduced-priced lunch as poverty concentration. 

In general, comparisons by these school characteristics are presented only where measurable 
differences  were  detected  and  followed  meaningful  patterns.    It  is  important  to  note  that  many  of  the 
school characteristics may also be related to each other, and complex interactions and relationships have 
not been explored here.  For example, enrollment size and instructional level of schools are related, with 
secondary schools typically being larger than elementary schools.  Similarly, poverty concentration and 
minority enrollment are related, with schools with a higher minority enrollment also more likely to have a 
higher concentration of poverty.  This report is purely descriptive in nature, and readers are cautioned not 
to  draw  causal  inferences  based  solely  on  the  bivariate  results  presented  in  this  report.  The  selected 

2 

 

findings are examples of comparisons that can be made using the data and are not designed to emphasize 
any particular issue.   

 
All  specific  statements  of  comparison  made  in  this  report  have  been  tested  for  statistical 
significance through t-tests adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment,1 and are 
significant at the 95 percent confidence level or better.  However, only selected findings are presented for 
each topic in the report.  Throughout this report, differences that appear large (particularly those by school 
characteristics) may not be statistically significant.  This absence of statistical significance is due in part 
to the relatively large standard errors surrounding the estimates and the use of the Bonferroni adjustment 
to control for multiple comparisons.  A detailed description of the statistical tests supporting the survey 
findings can be found in appendix A.   

 
 

Selected Findings 

The  findings  are  organized  to  address  the  following  issues:  school  connectivity,  student 
access  to  computers  and  the  Internet,  technologies  and  procedures  to  prevent  student  access  to 
inappropriate material on the Internet, teacher professional development on how to integrate the use of the 
Internet into the curriculum, and use of the Internet to provide opportunities and information for teaching 
and learning.  
 
 

School Connectivity  

 
The  FRSS  surveys  on  Internet  access  collected  information  on  several  key  measures  of 
school connectivity.  Schools were asked whether they had access to the Internet.  Schools with Internet 
access  were  also  asked  about  the  number  of  instructional  rooms  that  had  at  least  one  computer  with 
Internet access and the types of Internet connections used.  Information on the number of instructional 
rooms with Internet access was combined with information on the total number of instructional rooms in 
the school to calculate the percentage of instructional rooms with Internet access.2 

 

                                                      
1  The Bonferroni adjustment was also used for previous FRSS Internet reports and is used here for continuity of reporting.   
2  Instructional rooms include classrooms, computer and other labs, library/media centers, and any other rooms used for instructional purposes.

School and Instructional Room Access 

 

In fall 2005, nearly 100 percent of public schools in the United States had access to the 
Internet, compared with 35 percent in 1994 (table 1).  In 2005, no differences in school 
Internet  access  were  observed  by  any  school  characteristics,  which  is  consistent  with 
data reported previously.  There have been virtually no differences in school access to 
the Internet by school characteristics since 1999 (Parsad and Jones 2005).   

  Public  schools  have  made  consistent  progress  in  expanding  Internet  access  in 
instructional  rooms.    In  2005,  94  percent  of  public  school  instructional  rooms  had 
Internet access, compared with 3 percent in 1994 (figure 1 and table 2).  Across school 
characteristics, the proportion of instructional rooms with Internet access ranged from 88 
to 98 percent.

NOTE: Percentages are based on all public schools.  Information on the number of instructional rooms with Internet access was combined with 
information on the total number of instructional rooms in the school to calculate the percentage of instructional rooms with Internet access.  All  
of the estimates in this report were recalculated from raw data files using the same computational algorithms.  Consequently, some estimates 
presented here may differ trivially (i.e., 1 percent) from results published prior to 2001.  See table 2 for detailed data.

Type of Connection  

The types of Internet connections used by public schools and the speed at which computers 
are connected to the Internet have changed over the years.  In 1996, dial-up Internet connections (a type 
of  narrowband  connection)  were  used  by  about  three-fourths  (74  percent)  of  public  schools  having 
Internet access (Heaviside, Riggins, and Farris 1997).  In 2001, 5 percent of public schools used dial-up 
connections,  while  the  majority  of  public  schools  (55  percent)  reported  using  T1/DS1  lines  (a  type  of 
broadband connection), a continuous and much faster type of Internet connection than dial-up (Kleiner 
and Farris 2002).  Because of the increasing complexity of detailed information on types of connections, 
the  2002,  2003,  and  2005  surveys  directly  asked  whether  schools  used  broadband  and  narrowband 
connections.3  Schools also reported whether they used wireless connections to the Internet, the types of 
wireless connections used, and the number of instructional rooms with wireless connections.   

 
 

In 2005, 97 percent of public schools with Internet access used broadband connections to 
access the Internet (table 3).  In 2001 and 2000, 85 percent and 80 percent of the schools, 
respectively, were using broadband connections. 

 

In 2005, as in previous years (Parsad and Jones 2005), large schools were more likely 
than small schools to use broadband connections. Ninety-four percent of small schools 
reported  using  broadband  connections,  compared  with  nearly  100  percent  of  large 
schools (table 3).   

  Forty-five  percent  of  public  schools  with  Internet  access  used  wireless  connections  in 

2005, an increase from 32 percent in 2003 (table 4).4  

  Of  the  schools  using  wireless  Internet  connections  in  2005,  97  percent  indicated  that 
they used broadband wireless Internet connections, an increase from 92 percent in 2003 
(table  4).    Across  all  school  characteristics,  the  percentage  of  public  schools  with 
wireless  connections  using  broadband  wireless  Internet  connections  ranged  from  92 
percent to 99 percent.   

 

In  2005,  15  percent  of  all  public  school  instructional  rooms  had  wireless  Internet 
connections (table 5).  

                                                      
3  In 2000 and 2001, respondents were instructed to circle as many types of connections as there were in the school.  The 2002, 2003, and 2005 
questionnaires  directly  asked  whether  the  schools  used  broadband  and  narrowband  connections.    See  the  questionnaire  in  appendix  B  for 
definitions of broadband and narrowband connections. These percentages include schools using only broadband connections, as well as schools 
using both broadband and narrowband connections.  They do not include schools using narrowband connections exclusively.  In 2001, 2002, 
2003, and 2005, they also included DSL connections, which had not been an option on the 2000 questionnaire.  

4  A school could use both wireless and wired Internet connections.  Wireless Internet connections can be broadband or narrowband.

Student Access to Computers and the Internet 
 

The FRSS surveys on Internet access obtained information on various measures of student 
access  to  computers  and  the  Internet.    Schools  reported  the  number  of  instructional  computers  with 
Internet access; this information was then combined with enrollment data to compute the ratio of students 
to instructional computers with Internet access.  Schools were also asked about the provision of hand-held 
computers to students and teachers and laptop computer loans to students.   

 
 

Students Per Instructional Computer With Internet Access 

  The ratio of students to instructional computers with Internet access was computed by 
dividing  the  total  number  of  students  in  all  public  schools  by  the  total  number  of 
instructional computers with Internet access in all public schools (including schools with 
no  Internet  access).5  In  2005,  the  ratio  of  students  to  instructional  computers  with 
Internet  access  in  public  schools  was  3.8  to  1,  a  decrease  from  the  12.1  to  1  ratio  in 
1998, when it was first measured (figure 2 and table 6). The 2005 ratio of 3.8 to 1 also 
represents a decrease from 2003, when the ratio of students to instructional computers 
was 4.4 to 1.    

  The ratio of students to instructional computers showed some differences by all school 
characteristics in 2005 with the exception of poverty level (table 6).  For example, small 
schools had fewer students per computer than did medium-sized and large schools (2.4 
to  1  compared  with  3.9  to  1  and  4.0  to  1,  respectively).  In  addition,  schools  with  the 
lowest level of minority enrollment had fewer students per computer than did schools 
with higher minority enrollments.  

                                                      
5  This is one method of calculating students per computer.  Another method involves calculating the number of students in each school divided 
by the number of instructional computers with Internet access in each school and then taking the mean of this ratio across all schools.  When 
students per computer was first calculated for this NCES series in 1998, a decision was made to use the first method; this method continues to 
be  used  for  comparison  purposes.    A  couple  of  factors  influenced  the  choice  of  that  particular  method.    There  was  (and  continues  to  be) 
considerable  skewness  in  the  distribution  of  students  per  computer  per  school.    In  addition,  in  1998,  11  percent  of  public  schools  had  no 
instructional computers with Internet access.

NOTE:  The ratio of students to instructional computers with Internet access was computed by dividing the total number of students in all public 
schools by the total number of instructional computers with Internet access in all public schools (including schools with no Internet access).  All 
of the estimates in this report were recalculated from raw data files using the same computational algorithms.  Consequently, some estimates 
presented here may differ trivially (i.e., 1 percent) from results published prior to 2001.  See table 6 for detailed data.

Provision of Hand-Held Computers 

 

The  FRSS  surveys  collected  information  on  the  provision  of  hand-held  computers  to 
students and teachers. Hand-held computers are defined as computers, or personal digital assistants, small 
enough to be held in one hand. Examples are Palm Pilots or Pocket PCs. 

 
 

In  2005,  19  percent  of  public  schools  provided  hand-held  computers  to  students  or 
teachers for instructional purposes, an increase from 10 percent in 2003 (table 7).6  

                                                      
6  In 2002 and 2003, schools were asked one question about whether they provided hand-held computers to students or teachers.  In 2005, schools 

were asked separate questions about students and teachers. The responses were combined for 2005 to allow comparisons with previous years. 

7 

 

 

In  2005,  public  schools  were  more  likely  to  provide  hand-held  computers  to  teachers 
than to students. Seventeen percent of schools reported providing hand-held computers 
to teachers, compared with 8 percent of schools that reported having provided hand-held 
computers to students (table 8).  

Laptop Computer Loans  

Public schools reported whether they lent laptop computers to students and the  maximum 
length of time for which they could be borrowed.  Schools that did not lend laptop computers to students 
were asked about their future plans for such loans; for example, in 2005, schools were asked whether they 
planned to lend laptop computers to students in the 200607 school year. 

 
 

In 2005, 10 percent of public schools lent laptop computers to students (table 9).  

  Forty-seven  percent  of  schools  lending  laptop  computers  reported  that  students  could 
borrow them for less than 1 week, 17 percent reported that students could borrow them 
for a period of 1 week to less than 1 month, 16 percent reported lending laptops for the 
entire  school  year,  and  5  percent  reported  lending  laptops  for  some  other  maximum 
length of time (table 10).   

  Of the 90 percent of schools without laptop computers available for loan to students in 
2005 (calculated from table 9), 3 percent were planning to make laptops available for 
students to borrow during the next school year (table 11).   

 
Technologies and Procedures to Prevent Student Access to Inappropriate  
Material on the Internet  

Given the diversity of the information carried on the Internet, student access to inappropriate 
material  is  a  major  concern  of  many  parents  and  teachers.    Moreover,  under  the  Childrens  Internet 
Protection Act (CIPA), no school may receive E-rate7 discounts unless it certifies that it is enforcing a 
policy of Internet safety that includes the use of filtering or blocking technology.8 Beginning in 2001, the 
FRSS surveys on Internet access asked whether public schools used any technologies or procedures to 
prevent student access to inappropriate material on the Internet, the types of technologies or procedures 
used, and whether such technologies were used on all computers with Internet access used by students.  

                                                      
7  The Education rate (E-rate) program was established in 1996 to make telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections 
available to schools and libraries at discounted rates based upon the income level of the students in their community and whether their location 
is urban or rural. 

8  More information about CIPA (Public Law 106554) can be found at the website of the Schools and Libraries Division, Universal Service 
Administrative Company (http://www.sl.universalservice.org/reference/CIPA.asp).  The law is effective for funding year 4 (July 1, 2001, to 
June 30, 2002) and for all future years.  Schools and libraries receiving only telecommunications services are excluded from the requirements of 
CIPA.   

8 

 

The 2002, 2003, and 2005 surveys also asked about the methods used to disseminate information about 
the  technologies  or  procedures  to  students  and  parents.  (More  information  on  the  specific  types  of 
technologies and procedures is listed in appendix A.) 

 
 

In  2005,  nearly  100  percent  of  public  schools  with  Internet  access  used  various 
technologies  or  procedures  to  control  student  access  to  inappropriate  material  on  the 
Internet  (table  12).    Across  all  school  characteristics,  between  99  and  100  percent  of 
schools reported using these technologies or procedures.  In addition, 98 percent of these 
schools used at least one of these technologies or procedures on all Internet-connected 
computers used by students.   

  Among  schools  using  technologies  or  procedures  to  prevent  student  access  to 
inappropriate  material  on  the  Internet  in  2005,  99  percent  used  blocking  or  filtering 
software (table 13).  Ninety-six percent of schools reported that teachers or other staff 
members  monitored  student  Internet  access,  79  percent  had  a  written  contract  that 
parents have to sign, 76 percent had a contract that students have to sign, 67 percent used 
monitoring software, 53 percent had honor codes, and 46 percent allowed access only to 
their intranet.9   

  Ninety-five  percent  of  public  schools  using  technologies  or  procedures  to  prevent 
student access to inappropriate material on the Internet indicated that they disseminated 
the information about these technologies or other procedures via their school policies or 
rules distributed to students and parents (table 14).  Sixty-seven percent did so with a 
special  notice  to  parents,  57  percent  used  their  newsletters  to  disseminate  this 
information, 40 percent posted a message on the school website or web page, 28 percent 
had  a  notice  on  a  bulletin  board  at  the  school,  28  percent  had  a  pop-up  message  at 
computer  or  Internet  log  on,  and  4  percent  used  a  method  other  than  the  ones  listed 
above.  

 
 

Teacher Professional Development on How to Integrate the Use of the  
Internet Into the Curriculum  

Approximately one-half of public school teachers in 1999 reported that they used computers 
or the Internet for instruction during class time and/or that they assigned their students work that involved 
research using the Internet (Smerdon et al. 2000).  One-third of teachers reported feeling well or very well 
prepared to use computers and the Internet for instruction.  The 2002, 2003, and 2005 FRSS surveys on 
Internet  access  asked  public  schools  whether  they  or  their  districts  provided  teacher  professional 
development on how to integrate the use of the Internet into the curriculum in the 12 months prior to the 
surveys, and the percentage of teachers who attended such professional development. 

                                                      
9  An intranet is a controlled computer network similar to the Internet but accessible only to those who have permission to use it.  For example, 
school administrators can restrict student access to only their schools intranet, which may include information from the Internet chosen by 
school officials, rather than full Internet access.  See appendix A for definitions of technologies and procedures. 

9 

 

 

In  2005,  nationwide,  83  percent  of  public  schools  with  Internet  access  indicated  that 
their school or school district had offered professional development to teachers in their 
school on how to integrate the use of the Internet into the curriculum in the 12 months 
prior to the fall survey (table 15). 

  Thirty-four percent of the schools that offered professional development in 2005 had 1 
to 25 percent of their teachers attending such professional development in the 12 months 
preceding the survey (table 15).  Sixteen percent of the schools had 26 to 50 percent of 
their  teachers,  13  percent  of  the  schools  had  51  to  75  percent  of  their  teachers,  and  
36 percent of the schools had 76 percent or more of their teachers attending professional 
development  on  how  to  integrate  the  use  of  the  Internet  into  the  curriculum  in  the  
12 months preceding the survey. Less than 1 percent of schools reported not having any 
teachers attending such professional development during this time frame.  

 

Use of the Internet to Provide Opportunities and Information for Teaching 
and Learning 

Public  schools  reported  the  various  ways  in  which  they  used  the  Internet  to  provide 

opportunities and information for teaching and learning.  

 
  Eighty-nine percent of public schools indicated they use the Internet to provide data to 
inform  instructional  planning  at  the  school  level  (table  16).  Eighty-seven  percent  of 
public  schools  reported  using  the  Internet  to  provide  assessment  results  and  data  for 
teachers to use to individualize instruction, and 87 percent also reported providing high 
quality digital content (i.e., learning materials brought in from the Web, such as digital 
libraries and museums, or any text, images, sounds, and video that have been digitized). 
Additional  uses  of  the  Internet  included  providing  online  professional  development 
courses  to  teachers  (51  percent)  and  providing  access  for  students  to  online  distance 
learning for courses that are otherwise unavailable at the school, reported by 32 percent. 

  There were some differences in the use of the Internet by school characteristics (table 
16). For example, secondary schools were more likely than elementary schools to use 
the Internet for providing teacher professional development through online courses (59 
vs. 49 percent). Secondary schools were  more likely to provide access for students to 
online  distance  learning  (57  vs.  24  percent).  Rural  schools  also  were  more  likely  to 
provide access for students to online distance learning than schools in cities and urban 
fringe areas (43 vs. 25 and 24 percent, respectively). In addition, schools with the lowest 
level  of  minority  enrollment  were  less  likely  than  schools  with  the  highest  level  of 
minority  enrollment  to  use  the  Internet  to  provide  assessment  results  and  data  for 
teachers to use to individualize instruction (81 vs. 92 percent).

1Data for combined schools are included in the totals and in analyses by other school characteristics but are not shown separately.   
2Estimate is rounded to 100 percent for presentation in table. 
3Percent minority enrollment was not available for some schools.  In 1994, this information was missing for 100 schools.  In subsequent years, the 
missing information ranged from 0 schools to 46 schools.  In 2005, this information was missing for 20 schools.   
4Percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was not available for some schools.  In the 1994 survey, free and reduced-price lunch 
data came from the Common Core of Data (CCD) only and were missing for 430 schools (percentages presented in this table are based on cases 
for which data were available).  In reports prior to 1998, free and reduced-price lunch data were not reported for 1994.  In 1998, a decision was 
made to include the data for 1994 for comparison purposes.  In subsequent years, free and reduced-price lunch information was obtained on the 
questionnaire, supplemented, if necessary, with CCD data.  Missing data ranged from 0 schools (2002, 2003, and 2005) to 10 schools (1999).    
NOTE: All of the estimates in this report were recalculated from raw data files using the same computational algorithms.  Consequently, some 
estimates presented here may differ trivially (i.e., 1 percent) from results published prior to 2001.  For estimates that are 100 percent, the event

1Data for combined schools are included in the totals and in analyses by other school characteristics but are not shown separately. 
2Percent minority enrollment was not available for some schools.  In 1994, this information was missing for 100 schools.  In subsequent years, the 
missing information ranged from 0 schools to 46 schools.  In 2005, this information was missing for 20 schools.   
3Percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was not available for some schools.  In the 1994 survey, free and reduced-price lunch 
data came from the Common Core of Data (CCD) only and were missing for 430 schools (percentages presented in this table are based on cases 
for which data were available).  In reports prior to 1998, free and reduced-price lunch data were not reported for 1994.  In 1998, a decision was 
made to include the data for 1994 for comparison purposes.  In subsequent years, free and reduced-price lunch information was obtained on the 
questionnaire, supplemented, if necessary, with CCD data.  Missing data ranged from 0 schools (2002, 2003, and 2005) to 10 schools (1999).    
NOTE: Percentages are based on all public schools.  Information on the number of instructional rooms with Internet access was combined with 
information on the total number of instructional rooms in the school to calculate the percentage of instructional rooms with Internet access.  All of 
the estimates in this report were recalculated from raw data files using the same computational algorithms.  Consequently, some estimates 
presented here may differ trivially (i.e., 1 percent) from results published prior to 2001.

1Respondents were instructed to circle as many types of connections as there were in the school.  The data were then combined to show the 
percentage of schools using broadband connections.  Percentages include schools using only broadband connections, as well as schools using 
both broadband and narrowband connections.  They do not include schools using narrowband connections exclusively.  Broadband connections 
include T3/DS3, fractional T3, T1/DS1, fractional T1, and cable modem connections.  In 2001, they also included DSL connections, which had 
not been on the 2000 questionnaire.   
2The 2002, 2003, and 2005 questionnaires directly asked whether the schools used broadband and narrowband connections.  Broadband 
connections include T3/DS3, fractional T3, T1/DS1, fractional T1, cable modem, and DSL connections. 
3Data for combined schools are included in the totals and in analyses by other school characteristics but are not shown separately. 
4Estimate is rounded to 100 percent for presentation in table. 
5Percent minority enrollment was not available for 9 schools in 2000, 31 schools in 2001, 15 schools in 2002, 28 schools in 2003, and 20 schools 
in 2005.   
6Percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was not available for two schools in 2000 and 2001.  This information was available 
for all schools in 2002, 2003, and 2005. 
NOTE:  Percentages are based on the percent of public schools with Internet access: 98 percent in 2000, 99 percent in 2001 and 2002, 
99.8 percent in 2003, and 99.6 percent in 2005.  For estimates that are 100 percent, the event defined could have been reported by fewer schools 
had a different sample been drawn.

2002, 32 percent of public schools (99.8 percent with Internet access times 32 percent using wireless Internet connections) in 2003, and 45 
percent of public schools (99.6 percent with Internet access times 45 percent using wireless Internet connections) in 2005. 
3Data for combined schools are included in the totals and in analyses by other school characteristics but are not shown separately. 
4Percent minority enrollment was not available for 15 schools in 2002, 28 schools in 2003, and 20 schools in 2005.   
NOTE:  For estimates that are 100 percent, the event defined could have been reported by fewer schools had a different sample been drawn.

of the estimates in this report were recalculated from raw data files using the same computational algorithms.  Consequently, some estimates 
presented here may differ trivially (i.e., 1 percent) from results published prior to 2001.

Technical Notes 

The Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) was established in 1975 by the National Center 
for  Education  Statistics  (NCES),  U.S.  Department  of  Education.    FRSS  is  designed  to  collect  small 
amounts of issue-oriented data with minimal burden on respondents and with a quick turnaround from 
data collection to reporting. 

 
 

Sample Selection 

 
The  sample  of  elementary  and  secondary  schools  for  the  Internet  Access  in  U.S.  Public 
Schools,  Fall  2005  was  selected  from  the  200304  NCES  Common  Core  of  Data  (CCD)  Public 
Elementary/Secondary School Universe File, the most up-to-date file available at the time the sample was 
drawn.    Over  98,000  schools  are  contained  in the  200304  CCD  Public  Elementary/Secondary  School 
Universe  File.    For  this  survey,  regular  elementary  and  secondary/combined  schools  were  selected.  
Special education, vocational education, and alternative schools were excluded from the sampling frame, 
along with schools with a highest grade below first grade and those outside the 50 states and the District 
of  Columbia.    With  these  exclusions,  the  final  sampling  frame  consisted  of  about  85,000  schools,  of 
which  about  63,000  were  classified  as  elementary  schools  and  about  21,000  as  secondary/combined 
schools.1 

 
A sample of 1,205 schools was selected from the public school frame.  To select the sample, 
the  frame  of  schools  was  stratified  by  instructional  level  (elementary,  secondary/combined  schools), 
enrollment  size  (less  than  300  students,  300  to  499,  500  to  999,  1,000  to  1,499,  1,500  or  more),  and 
percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (less than 35 percent, 35 to 49 percent, 50 
to 74 percent, 75 percent or more).  Schools in the highest poverty category (schools with 75 percent or 
more  students  eligible  for  free  or  reduced-price  lunch)  were  oversampled  to  permit  analyses  for  that 
category. 

 
 

                                                      
1 During data collection, a number of sampled schools were found to be outside the scope of the survey, usually because they were closed or 

merged.  This reduced the number of schools in the sampling frame to an estimated 82,482. 

A-3 

 

Respondents and Response Rates 

 
The three-page survey instrument was designed by Westat and NCES to address most of the 
issues examined in the 2003 survey on Internet access.  These issues included access to the Internet in 
instructional  rooms,  the  types  of  Internet  connections  used,  laptop  loans,  hand-held  computers  for 
students and teachers, teacher professional development on how to integrate the use of the Internet into 
the curriculum, technologies and procedures used to prevent student access to inappropriate material on 
the Internet, and use of the Internet to provide opportunities and information for teaching and learning.  

 
Questionnaires and cover letters were mailed to the principals of the 1,205 sampled schools 
in early October 2005.  The letter introduced the study and requested that the questionnaire be completed 
by  the  technology  coordinator  or  person  most  knowledgeable  about  Internet  access  at  the  school.  
Respondents were offered the option of completing the survey via the Web or by mail.  Telephone follow-
up for survey nonresponse and data clarification was initiated in November 2005, and data collection was 
completed in March 2006.  Thirty-four schools were outside the scope of the survey because they had 
closed  or  merged  with  other  schools,  and  1,012  schools  completed  the  survey.  Of  the  schools  that 
completed  the  survey,  65  percent  completed  it  by  Web,  24  percent  completed  it  by  mail,  10  percent 
completed it by fax, and less than 1 percent completed it by telephone. The unweighted and weighted 
response rates were both 86 percent.  

 
 

Imputation for Item Nonresponse 

The  weighted  item  nonresponse  for  questionnaire  items  was  less  than  1  percent.    The 
nonresponse rate for a particular item was calculated using the number of responses as the numerator and 
the  estimated  number  of  eligible  cases  that  should  have  responded  to  the  item  as  the  denominator.  
Although item nonresponse for key items was very low, missing data were imputed for the 14 items listed 
in  table  A-1.    No  imputation  was  done  for  school  characteristic  variables  (e.g.,  percent  minority 
enrollment) that were created from CCD data.  The missing items included both numerical data such as 
counts of instructional rooms and computers, as well as categorical data such as the provision of hand-
held  computers  to  students.    The  missing  data  were  imputed  using  a  hot-deck  approach  to  obtain  a 
donor  school  from  which  the  imputed  values  were  derived.    Under  the  hot-deck  approach,  a  donor 
school that matched selected characteristics of the school with missing data was identified.  The matching 
characteristics included level, enrollment size class, type of locale, and total number of computers in the 
school.  Once a donor was found, it was used to derive the imputed values for the school with missing

data.  For categorical items, the imputed value was simply the corresponding value from the donor school.  
For  numerical  items,  an  appropriate  ratio  (e.g.,  the  proportion  of  instructional  rooms  with  wireless 
Internet  connections)  was  calculated  for  the  donor  school,  and  this  ratio  was  applied  to  available  data 
(e.g.,  reported  number  of  instructional  rooms)  for  the  recipient  school  to  obtain  the  corresponding 
imputed value.  All missing items for a given school were imputed from the same donor. 
 
 
Sampling and Nonsampling Errors 
 

The survey responses were weighted to produce national estimates (table A-2).  The weights 
were  designed  to  adjust  for  the  variable  probabilities  of  selection  and  differential  nonresponse.    The 
findings  in  this  report  are  based  on  the  sample  of  schools  selected  and,  consequently,  are  subject  to 
sampling variability.  The standard error is the measure of the variability of estimates due to sampling.  It 
indicates the variability of a sample estimate that would be obtained from all possible samples of a given 
design and size.  Standard errors are used as a measure of the precision expected from a particular sample.  

A-5 

 

If all possible samples were surveyed under similar conditions, intervals of 1.96 standard errors below to 
1.96  standard  errors  above  a  particular  statistic  would  include  the  true  population  parameter  being 
estimated in about 95 percent of the samples.  This is a 95 percent confidence interval.  For example, the 
estimated percentage of instructional rooms with Internet access in 2005 is 94 percent, and the estimated 
standard error is 1.3 percent.  The 95 percent confidence interval for the statistic extends from 94  (1.3 x 
1.96) to 94 + (1.3 x 1.96), or from 91 to 97 percent.  The coefficient of variation (c.v., also referred to 
as  the  relative  standard  error)  expresses  the  standard  error  as  a  percentage  of  the  quantity  being 
estimated.  The c.v. of an estimate (y) is defined as c.v. = (s.e./y) x 100.  Throughout this report, for any 
coefficient  of  variation  higher  than  50  percent,  the  data  are  flagged  with  the  note  that  they  should  be 
interpreted with caution, as the value of the estimate may be unstable.

Differences between two estimates can be examined by comparing the confidence intervals 
around the two estimates.  If the confidence intervals overlap, then differences in the estimates are likely 
due  to  sampling  variability  rather  than  any  real  differences  in  values.    In  instances  where  a  survey 
estimate is 100 percent, there is no measured variability around the estimate, and therefore no standard 
error or confidence interval can be  computed.  However, for these  estimates of 100 percent, the event 
(e.g.,  whether  the  school  has  access  to  the  Internet)  could  have  been  reported  by  fewer  schools  had  a 
different  sample  been  selected.    When  comparing  the  estimate  of  100  percent  to  another  estimate,  a 
confidence interval around the other estimate that includes the 100 percent indicates that the difference in 
the two estimates is likely due to sampling variability. 

 
For example, the percentage of public schools with access to the Internet located in cities 
(see tables 1 and 1a) was estimated to be 100 percent in 2003 (with no standard error), and 99.4 percent 
(which rounds to 99 percent for presentation in the table) in 2005 (with a standard error of 0.6).  The 95 
percent confidence interval around the 2005 estimate of 99 percent extends from 98.2 percent to greater 
than  100  percent.    Thus,  the  confidence  intervals  for  the  2003  estimate  of  100  percent  and  the  2005 
estimate of 99 percent overlap, and the decrease from 2003 to 2005 can be attributed with a high level of 
confidence to sampling variability. 

 
Because  the  data  from  this  survey  were  collected  using  a  complex  sampling  design,  the 
sampling errors of the estimates from this survey (e.g., estimates of proportions) are typically larger than 
would be expected based on a simple random sample.  Not taking the complex sample design into account 
can lead to an underestimation of the standard errors associated with such estimates.  To generate accurate 
standard errors for the estimates in this report, standard errors were computed using a technique known as 
jackknife  replication.    As  with  any  replication  method,  jackknife  replication  involves  constructing  a 
number of subsamples (replicates) from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for each 
replicate.  The mean square error of the replicate estimates around the full sample estimate provides an 
estimate of the variance of the statistic.  To construct the replications, 50 stratified subsamples of the full 
sample  were  created  and  then  dropped  one  at  a  time  to  define  50  jackknife  replicates.    A  computer 
program  (WesVar)  was  used  to  calculate  the  estimates  of  standard  errors.    WesVar  is  a  stand-alone 
Windows application that computes sampling errors from complex samples for a wide variety of statistics 
(totals,  percents,  ratios,  log-odds  ratios,  general  functions  of  estimates  in  tables,  linear  regression 
parameters, and logistic regression parameters). 

 
The test statistics used in the analysis were calculated using the jackknife variances and thus 
appropriately reflect the complex nature of the sample design.  In particular, Bonferroni adjustments were 
made  to  control  for  multiple  comparisons  where  appropriate.    For  example,  for  an  experiment-wise 

A-7 

 

comparison involving g pairwise comparisons, each difference was tested at the 0.05/g significance level 
to control for the fact that g differences were simultaneously tested.  The Bonferroni adjustment was also 
used for previous FRSS Internet reports and is used here to maintain continuity with prior reporting.  The 
Bonferroni  adjustment  results  in  a  more  conservative  critical  value  for  judging  statistical  significance.  
This means that comparisons that would have been significant with a critical value of 1.96 may not be 
significant  with  the  more  conservative  critical  value.    For  example,  the  critical  value  for  comparisons 
between any two of the four categories of poverty concentration is 2.64 rather than 1.96.   
 

The  survey  estimates  are  also  subject  to  nonsampling  errors  that  can  arise  because  of 
nonobservation (nonresponse or noncoverage) errors, errors of reporting, and errors made in collection of 
the data.  These errors can sometimes bias the data.  Nonsampling errors may include such problems as 
the  difference  in  the  respondents  interpretation  of  the  meaning  of  the  question;  memory  effects; 
misrecording of responses; incorrect editing, coding, or data entry; differences related to the particular 
time the survey was conducted; or errors in data preparation.  While general sampling theory can be used 
in part to determine how to estimate the sampling variability of a statistic, nonsampling errors are not easy 
to measure and, for measurement purposes, usually require that an experiment be conducted as part of the 
data  collection  procedures  or  that  data  external  to  the  study  be  used.    To  minimize  the  potential  for 
nonsampling  errors,  the  questionnaire  on  Internet  access  in  public  schools  was  pretested  in  1994,  and 
again each time it was substantially modified.  The full questionnaire was last pretested for the fall 2001 
survey, since a few new topics were introduced in the survey.  Several items added to or modified in the 
2005 survey were also pretested. The pretesting was done with public school technology coordinators and 
other knowledgeable respondents like those who would complete the survey.  During the design of the 
survey,  an  effort  was  made  to  check  for  consistency  of  interpretation  of  questions  and  to  eliminate 
ambiguous items.  The questionnaire and instructions were intensively reviewed by NCES.   

 
Manual and machine editing of the questionnaire responses were conducted to check the data 
for accuracy and consistency.  Cases with missing or inconsistent items were recontacted by telephone to 
resolve problems.  Data were keyed with 100 percent verification for surveys received by mail, fax, or 
telephone.

Definitions of Analysis Variables 

 

Instructional levelSchools were classified according to their grade span in the 200304 Common Core 
of  Data  (CCD)  Public  Elementary/Secondary  School  Universe  File.    Data  for  combined  schools  are 
included in the totals and in analyses by other school characteristics, but are not shown separately.  Thus, 
data are reported for the following categories: 
 

Elementary schoolHad grade 6 or lower and no grade higher than grade 8. 
Secondary schoolHad no grade lower than grade 7 and had grade 7 or higher. 

A-9 

 

School  sizeThis  variable  indicates  the  total  enrollment  of  students  based  on  data  from  the  200304 
CCD Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe File.  For sampling purposes, schools were grouped 
into five enrollment size classesless than 300 students, 300 to 499, 500 to 999, 1,000 to 1,499, 1,500 or 
more.  Use of the more detailed size categories ensures greater diversity of schools in the sample with 
respect to size, and permits a more nearly optimal allocation of the sample for estimating school-level 
characteristics that are correlated with enrollment.  Because of the relatively small sample size and large 
standard errors associated with small cell sizes, the following three combined categories were used for 
analysis purposes: 
 

Less than 300 students 
300 to 999 students 
1,000 or more students 

 
LocaleThis variable indicates the type of community in which the school is located, as defined in the 
200304 CCD Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe File (which uses definitions based on U.S. 
Census Bureau classifications).  The variable was based on the eight-category locale variable from CCD 
and collapsed into the following four categories for this report. 
 

CityA  central  city  of  a  Consolidated  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  (CMSA)  or  Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (MSA).   
Urban fringeAny incorporated place, Census-designated place, or non-place territory within a 
CMSA or MSA of a large or mid-size city and defined as urban by the Census Bureau.   
TownAn incorporated place or Census-designated place with a population greater than or equal 
to 2,500 and located outside a CMSA or MSA.   
RuralAny incorporated place, Census-designated place, or non-place territory designated as rural 
by the Census Bureau.   

 
Percent  minority  enrollmentThis  variable  indicates  the  percent  of  students  enrolled  in  the  school 
whose race or ethnicity is classified as one of the following: American Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian or 
Pacific  Islander;  Black,  non-Hispanic;  or  Hispanic,  based  on  data  in  the  200304  CCD  Public 
Elementary/Secondary School Universe File.  The categories are: 
 

 
Percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunchThis variable was based on responses to 
question  25  on  the  survey  questionnaire;  if  it  was  missing  from  the  questionnaire  (2.0  percent  of  all 
cases), it was obtained from the 200304 CCD Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe File.  This 
item served as a measurement of the concentration of poverty at the school.  The categories are: 
 

Less than 6 percent 
6 to 20 percent 
21 to 49 percent 
50 percent or more 

Less than 35 percent 
35 to 49 percent 
50 to 74 percent 
75 percent or more 

 

A-10 

 

It is important to note that many of the school characteristics used for independent analysis 
may  also  be  related  to  each  other.    For  example,  school  size  and  locale  are  related,  with  city  schools 
typically being larger than rural schools.  Similarly, poverty concentration and minority enrollment are 
related, with schools with a higher minority enrollment also more likely to have a higher concentration of 
poverty.    Other  relationships  between  analysis  variables  may  exist.    However,  this  report  focuses  on 
bivariate  relationships  between  the  analysis  variables  and  questionnaire  variables  rather  than  more 
complex analyses.
