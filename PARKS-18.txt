ABSTRACT 
We  evaluated  the  livelihood  linkages  of  existing  tourism  practices  in  Kaziranga  National  Park,  a  World 
Heritage  site  located  in  Assam,  India.  The  main  objective  of  the  study  was  to  assess  the  contribution  of 
tourism to local livelihoods and suggest ways to strengthen these linkages. Focus group  discussions and 
interviews  of  tourism  service  providers  were  carried  out  to  identify  their  share  of  tourism  income.  A 
survey  of  tourists  was  conducted  to  examine  the  amount  spent  by  visitors  while  visiting  the  park.  The 
primary data was supplemented by secondary information obtained from the park office, service providers 
and records of village self-help groups. In 2006-2007, the total amount of money that flowed through the 
tourism  sector  in  Kaziranga  National  Park  was  estimated  to  be  US$  5  million  per  annum,  of  which 
different  stakeholders  (excluding  government)  received  US$  3.27  million  per  annum.  The  balance  of 
income  flowed  as  leakage  for  purchase  of  supplies  and  logistic  support  outside  the  tourism  zone.  The 
financial benefits to local stakeholders may increase if the leakages could be prevented through planned 
interventions  such  as  proper  marketing  of  products  from  cottage  industries  and  strengthening  of  local 
level  institutions.  In  addition  to  wildlife  viewing,  promotion  of  nature  trails  and  package  tours  may  be 
encouraged in the buffer zones and adjoining forests areas to enhance tourist visitation to un-tapped sites 
that could provide additional livelihood options to local communities. 

INTRODUCTION 

Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and 

Development,  held  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1992,  several 

attempts  have  been  made 

to 

link  protected  area 

management  with  developing  sustainable 

livelihood 

options  for  local  communities  (Naughton-Treves  et  al., 

2005).  The  underlying  notion  has  been  that  the  cost  of 

conservation borne by local communities could be offset by 

the monetary benefits derived from conservation activities, 

thereby  minimizing  the  potential  negative  attitudes  of  the 

local  community  towards  conservation  (Spiteri  &  Nepal, 

communities making them hostile to conservation (Badola 

1999; Brockington et al., 2006). Various community-based 

conservation  programmes 

such  as 

the 

Integrated 

Conservation  and  Development  Programme  (ICDP)  or  the 

eco-development  programme,  have 

tried 

to 

involve 

communities into conservation initiatives to improve their 

well  being  primarily  through  livelihood  generation,  and 

building partnership in protected area conservation (Wells, 

1992; Larson et al., 1998; Badola, 2000; Hughes & Flintan, 

2001).  
 
Since  1992,  a  global  commitment  to  protect  biodiversity 

2008; Wells & Brandon, 1992). Creation of protected areas, 

through  establishment  of  protected  areas  and  sustainable 

especially  National  Parks,  that  completely  ban  extractive 

resource use has been initiated through the Convention on 

resource  use,  has  left  few  options  for  forest  dependent

desirability  of  equitable  benefit  sharing  from  sustainable 

use  of  biological  diversity  (CBD,  1992).  The  primary 

objective of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 is 

to  conserve  biodiversity  and  enhance  its  benefits  for 

people. The Strategic Plan is comprised of a shared vision, 

a  mission,  strategic  goals  and  20  targets,  known  as  the 

Aichi  Biodiversity  Targets.  The  Aichi  Targets  reinforce 

CBDs  goals  via  increasing  the  coverage  of  protected  areas 

and devising innovative schemes for alternative sustainable 

and equitable livelihoods to forest dependent communities  

(CBD, 2011).  

 

Tourism  can  be  one  of  the  important  means  for  achieving 

the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as it has potential to augment 

equitable  livelihood  opportunities  for  forest  dependent 

communities, 

thereby  eliciting 

local  participation 

in 

www.iucn.org/parks    34        

because  of  extensive  support  from  visitors  (Eagles  et  al., 

2002). However, studies have highlighted the relationship 

between  tourism  visitation  and  degradation  of  habitats 

(Geneletti & Dawa, 2009) coinciding with a growing divide 

between the rich and the poor (Kideghesho et al., 2006). In 

most  cases,  the  marginalized  communities  living  adjacent 

to  the  wilderness  areas  and  who  depend  most  on 

biodiversity  for  survival  have  few  linkages  with  tourism 

activities  (MacLellan  et  al.,  2000).  It  is  the  rich  and  the 

influential  from  within  as  well  as  outside  the  region  who 

stand to gain most from protected area tourism. Moreover, 

revenues  generated  through  poorly  developed  market 

chains  for  local  goods  and  services,  in  most  cases,  are 

prone  to  leakages  due  to  few  linkages  with  the  local 

economy (Walpole & Goodwin, 2000; Torres 2003; Lacher 

&  Nepal,  2010;  Sandbrook,  2010).  This  prevents  local 

people  from  deriving  substantial  benefits  from  tourism 

activities,  often  marginalizing  them  due  to  minimal 

financial  benefits  (Spiteri  &  Nepal,  2008),  miniscule 

employment  (Karanth  &  DeFries,  2011),  and/or  increased 

cost  of  living  (Karanth  &  Nepal,  2011).  Encouraging  local 

ownership  in  tourism  activities  through  capacity  building 

at  the  village  or  community  level  has  been  suggested  as  a 

means to minimize tourism revenue leakages and increase 

benefits  from  tourism-related  conservation  (Walpole  & 

Goodwin, 2000; Eagles et al, 2002; Lacher & Nepal, 2010).  

 

Given the global concerns for biodiversity conservation and 

equitable  livelihoods,  this  paper  explores  the  livelihood 

linkages  associated  with  tourism  in  one  of  the  most 

favoured  tourist  destinations  in  northeast  India,  the 

Kaziranga  National  Park.  It  looks  at  the  distribution  of 

tourism  revenue  among  the  stakeholders.  It  also  explores 

the leakages of tourism revenue at and nearby the park and 

suggests  ways  and  measures  to  minimize  these  for 

betterment  of  conservation  and  achievement  of  the  Aichi 

Biodiversity  Targets,  especially  Target  14:  By  2020, 

ecosystems  that  provide  essential  services,  including 

services  related  to  water,  and  contribute  to  health, 

livelihoods and well-being, are restored and safeguarded, 

taking 

into  account 

the  needs  of...the  poor  and 

vulnerable  (CBD,  2011).  Addressing  the  leakages  would 

safeguard  the  livelihood  of  vulnerable  sections  of  the 

society.

population yet their income share in total tourism income was 

the highest. Similarly, the proportion of the total population of  

taxi  and  boarding/  lodging  facility  owners  was  low  but  their 

share in total tourism income for the area was high (Figure 3). 

The  lowest  income  to  population  ratio  was  recorded  for 

artisans/weavers  (0.4)  and  farmers  (0.7),  as  they  had  the 

highest  population  but  lowest  share  in  total  income.  The 

segmentation  of  the  total  tourism  income  received  by  the 

people  around  the  Park  shows  that  inequity  exists  in  the 

sharing of tourism revenue. 
 
Tourist inflow to Kaziranga during the last ten years (2000-

2009)  rose  from  37,696  Indian  tourists  to  over  100,000 

and  from  1,623  to  6,000  foreign  tourists  (Government  of 

Assam,  n.d.).  Revenue  realized  by  the  forest  department 

from  visits  of  these  tourists  also  increased  (though  not 

proportionally) from US$ 49,539 per annum in 1999/2000 

to US$ 249,348 per annum in 2008/9 (Table 2). 

 

In  2006/7  the  average  Indian  tourist  spent  US$  24.4  per 

person per  day  and  overseas  tourists  spent  US$  133.3  per 

person  per  day  on  various  services  (boarding,  food,  local

DISCUSSION 

The  monetary  flow  into  individual  households  at  the  local 

level  is  derived  mainly  from  sale  of  agricultural  produce 

and fish and from tea estates wages (Shrivastava & Heinen, 

2007).  The  local  people  depend  on  the  Park  resources  to 

meet  their  day-to-day  biomass  requirements  often  leading 

to  confrontation  between  people  and  the  park  authority 

(Shrivastava & Heinen, 2007). Instances of human-wildlife 

conflicts 

in  the  region  (DiFonzo,  2007)  are  further 

compromising  local  livelihoods  as  well  as  biodiversity. 

Efforts are being made by the government to involve local 

communities  in  protected  area  conservation  by  providing 

them with alternate sources of livelihoods and by involving 

them in ecotourism activities (NTCA, 2012; Government of 

Assam, n.d.). Tourism income has been advocated to be the 

best  possible  alternate  livelihood  for  forest  dependent 

communities  (Sekhar,  2003;  Nyaupane  &  Poudel,  2011; 

Badola  et  al.,  2012;  Chandola,  2012).  Kaziranga  National 

Park,  being  a  popular  tourist  destination,  receives  a  high 

volume  of  national  and  international  tourists  every  year. 

The average growth rate of tourist inflow for Kaziranga was 

73.6  per  cent  in  contrast  to  31.8  per  cent  for  Mudumalai 

National  Park,  17.4  per  cent  for  Kanha  National  Park  and 

17  per  cent  for  Ranthambore  National  Park  during  2002-

2008  (Karanth  &  DeFries,  2011).  Income  of  people  from 

tourist establishments in Kaziranga was found to be about 

40  per  cent  of  the  total  tourist  expenditure.  The  Assam 

Forest Department received 10 per cent of the total tourist 

expenditure and the remaining 50 per cent was found to be 

spent  on  services  outside  the  Kaziranga.  Thus,  this  50  per 

cent of tourist expenditure is the leakage for the study site. 

costs  paid  for  staff  and  capital  from  outside  the  area.  The 

skilled  staff  employed  in  the  resorts  and  luxury  hotels  are 

mostly outsourced. Some leakages also occur due to money 

spent by foreign tourists in reaching the destination. 

 

The  tourism  industry  around  Kaziranga  has  not  been  able 

to  adequately  utilize  the  potential  of  local  communities  as 

supporters of conservation, leaving them with minimal and 

indirect  benefits  of  tourism  due  to  enclave  tourism 

(Mbaiwa,  2005)  resulting  from  negligible  interactions 

between  the  local  population  and  tourists.  The  products 

produced  by  the  local  people  rarely  enter  the  tourist 

markets,  providing  little  scope  for  improved  well-being  of 

local  populations  from  tourism.  The  high  leakages  of 

tourism  revenue  are  reflected  in  the  inability  of  the 

community  to  garner  the  benefits  of  tourism  (Lindberg  et 

al.,  1996;  Walpole  &  Goodwin,  2000;  Mbaiwa,  2005; 

Lacher  &  Nepal,  2010)  resulting  from  a  lack  of  local 

involvement, and local communities own lack of expertise, 

and  infrastructure  to  support  tourism  (Lindberg,  1998; 

Lacher & Nepal, 2010).  
 

Some  of  the  measures  that  can  be  used  to  retain  the 

monetary  benefits  within  the  local  community  and  to 

encourage sustainable development include:  

  encouraging  local  ownership,  capital  and  value  chain 
additions  of  local  products  such  as  locally  grown  tea-

leaves,  bamboo  shoots  and  chilly  pickles  (Walpole  & 

Goodwin,  2000;  Meyer,  2007;  Lacher  &  Nepal,  2010; 

Nyaupane & Poudel, 2011); 

  developing  markets  for  local  goods  by  identifying  and 
strengthening  supply-demand  linkages  (Ollenburg  & 

Buckley, 2007);  

This  is  higher  than  Indias  leakage  rate  (40  per  cent)

inter-sectoral 

linkages  such  as 

those 

related to tourism (UNEP, n.d.). In the case of Kaziranga ,

CONCLUSIONS 

The  livelihood  opportunities  of  the  populations  living  in 

the  fringes  of  the  protected  areas,  pose  an  interesting 

challenge  to  the  protected  area  managers.  The  managers 

need  to  look  for  alternative  livelihood  options,  which 

Periyar Tiger Reserve and self initiated Community Based 

Ecotourism Centres, in Chilika Lake (Bhatt et al., 2012) are 

testimony  to  the  critical  role  of  local  institutions  in 

equitable  and  sustainable  benefits  from  protected  areas

minimal  construction  and  capital  requirements.  This  has

RESUMEN 
Evaluamos  los  vinculos  entre  los  medios  de  subsistencia  y  las  actividades  turisticas  emprendidas  en  el 
Parque  Nacional  Kaziranga,  un  sitio  del  Patrimonio  Mundial  ubicado  en  Assam,  India.  La  finalidad 
primordial  de  este estudio consistio en evaluar la contribucion del turismo  a los medios de subsistencia 
locales y sugerir formas para reforzar dichos vinculos. Se llevaron a cabo debates de grupos de reflexion y 
entrevistas  a  los  proveedores  de  servicios  turisticos  para  determinar  su  cuota  de  participacion  en  los 
ingresos provenientes del turismo. Se realizo un sondeo de turistas para conocer la cantidad gastada por 
los  visitantes  durante  su  visita  al  parque.  Los  datos  primarios  se  complementaron  con  informacion 
secundaria  obtenida  de  la  oficina  del  parque,  de  los  proveedores  de  servicios  y  de  los  registros  de  los 
grupos  comunitarios  de  autogestion.  En  el  periodo  20062007,  los  ingresos  totales  generados  a  traves 
del  sector  turismo  en  el  Parque  Nacional  Kaziranga  se  estimaron  en  USD5,0  millones  anuales,  de  los 
cuales los diferentes interesados directos (excluyendo el Gobierno) recibieron USD3,27 millones anuales. 
El  saldo  restante  se  destino  a  la  compra  de  suministros  y  apoyo  logistico  fuera  de  la  zona  turistica.  Los 
beneficios  financieros  para  las  comunidades  locales  podrian  aumentar  evitando  estas  desviaciones 
mediante  intervenciones  planificadas,  tales  como  la  comercializacion  adecuada  de  los  productos  de  las 
industrias artesanales y el fortalecimiento de las instituciones locales. Ademas de la observacion de fauna 
silvestre,  se  podria  promover  caminatas  por  senderos  naturales  y  viajes  combinados  en  las  zonas  de 
amortiguamiento y los bosques adyacentes para aumentar las visitas de turistas a sitios con potencial no 
aprovechado que podrian proporcionar opciones adicionales de sustento para las comunidades locales. 
 
RESUME 
Nous avons evalue les liens entre les moyens de subsistance et les pratiques touristiques existantes dans le 
Parc national de Kaziranga, un site du Patrimoine mondial situe a Assam, en Inde. Le principal objectif de 
letude  est  devaluer  la  contribution  du  tourisme  aux  moyens  de  subsistance  locaux,  et  de  proposer  des 
mesures pour renforcer ces liens. Des discussions de groupes ciblees et des entretiens avec les prestataires 
de  services  touristiques  ont  ete  menes  afin  devaluer  leur  part  du  revenu  touristique.  Une  enquete  a 
egalement ete realisee aupres des touristes afin devaluer les sommes depensees lors de leur visite dans le 
parc.  Ces  donnees  primaires  ont  ete  completees  dinformations  secondaires  fournies  par  le  Bureau  du 
parc,  les  prestataires  de  services  et  les  donnees  des  groupes  dentraide  de  villages.  En  20062007,  la 
somme totale ayant circule dans le secteur du tourisme dans le Parc national de Kaziranga est estimee a 
environ 5 millions de dollars US par an, dont les differents acteurs (a  lexclusion du gouvernement) ont 
percu  3,27  millions  de  dollars  US  par  an.  Le  solde  du  revenu  sexplique  par  des  fuites  pour  lachat 
dapprovisionnement et le soutien logistique en dehors de la zone touristique. Ainsi, on peut supposer que 
les  avantages  financiers  augmenteront  pour  les  acteurs  locaux  si  les  fuites  sont  minimisees  par  le  biais 
dinterventions planifiees comme la commercialisation efficace des produits issus des industries familiales 
et  le  renforcement  des  institutions  locales.  Outre  lobservation  de  la  faune  sauvage,  la  promotion  de 
sentiers  de  randonnee  nature  et  de  voyages  tout-compris  peut  etre  encouragee  dans  les  zones  tampons. 
Enfin,  il  est  possible  dajouter  les  zones  forestieres  pour  accroitre  la  frequentation  dans  des  sites 
inexploites, ce qui offrirait des moyens de subsistance supplementaires aux communautes locales.
