Hurricanes and the Urban Forest: I. Effects on Southeastern
United States Coastal Plain Tree Species
Mary L. Duryea, Eliana Kampf, and Ramon C. Littell

Abstract. Several hurricanes struck Florida, U.S. in 2004 and 2005 causing widespread damage to urban and rural areas.
We measured the impacts of five of these hurricanes on the urban forest and combined these results with four other
hurricanes to present an assessment of wind resistance for southeastern United States coastal plain tree species. Urban forest
loss was positively correlated with wind speed. Tree species demonstrating the highest survival in winds were sand live oak
(Quercus geminata), American holly (Ilex opaca), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), live oak (Quercus virginiana), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), crapemyrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), dogwood
(Cornus florida), and sabal palm (Sabal palmetto). In a statistical comparison of sand live oak, live oak, and laurel oak
(Quercus laurifolia) survival after four panhandle hurricanes, laurel oak had significantly poorer survival than both live oak
and sand live oak. Among all species, larger trees lost more branches than medium and smaller trees. Leaf loss had a
positive relationship with survival; losing leaves during the hurricane meant higher survival. Trees growing in groups or
clusters had greater survival than those growing as individual trees. Tree species with higher wood density had greater
survival. Tree species categorized as having dense crowns lost more branches than those with moderate and open crowns;
however, contrary to the literature, dense-crowned species survived best. A survey of arborists, scientists, and urban
foresters ranked species for their wind resistance. Using our results from hurricane measurements and incorporating results
from the survey and the scientific literature, we have developed lists of relative wind resistance for tree species in the
southeastern coastal plain. These lists should be used with caution with the knowledge that no species and no tree is
completely windproof. In addition, local considerations such as soil, cultural practices, tree age and health, and other urban
forest conditions need to be taken into account.
Key Words. Trees; tropical storms; urban trees; wind.

In 2004, four hurricanes struck Florida with maximum sustained winds ranging from 169 to 233 km/h (105 to 145 mph).
In 2005, Hurricane Dennis struck the Florida panhandle at
193 km/h (120 mph). The impacts of these five hurricanes
were widespread ranging from urban areas to agricultural
croplands to Florida’s natural ecosystems. Since 1992 when
Hurricane Andrew struck south Florida, we have been studying the impacts of hurricanes on the urban forest (Duryea et
al. 1996). We continued with measurements of hurricane
wind damage to urban neighborhoods again in 1995 when
two hurricanes struck the Pensacola, Florida, area (Duryea
1997) and then again in 1998 when Hurricane Georges
crossed over the entire island of Puerto Rico. These nine
hurricanes with their varied wind speeds gave us the opportunity to study over 80 tree species and their comparable
responses to hurricanes. This study reports on and synthesizes
the types of tree damage, possible reasons for damage, and
ways to avert damage in the future for southeastern coastal

plain species in urban forests. Tropical and subtropical species are reported in a separate article in this issue.
A considerable number of studies have investigated the
effects of hurricane force winds on damage, mortality, and
recovery of tree populations within natural forest ecosystems.
In general, they have found that large trees (with large diameters and heights) experience more wind damage (Glitzenstein and Harcombe 1988; Webb 1989; Walker 1991) and
older forests are more damaged (Everham and Brokaw 1996).
Several studies report that tree species respond differently
with uprooting, stem breakage, or crown damage (Gresham et
al. 1991; reviewed in Everham and Brokaw 1996). Everham
and Brokaw rate 242 tree species from 47 studies for wind
resistance in low- and high-intensity storms. When species
are categorized according to conifers and dicots or by successional class (pioneer versus nonpioneer species), no clear
trends are apparent. This lack of correlation with damage is
also true for the influence of topography where damage ap-

pears to be predictable on a large scale (for example, the
windward versus leeward sides of a mountain) but inconsistent at smaller topographic scales (Everham and Brokaw
1996).
When trying to explain differences in damage, many studies have found greater damage with increasing hurricane intensity (Tanner et al. 1991). Increased rainfall associated with
a hurricane and saturated soils results in more tree mortality
and especially the uprooting of trees (Cremer et al. 1982;
Peterson and Pickett 1991; Tanner et al. 1991). Several studies have found a negative correlation between wood density
and mortality during hurricanes (Putz et al. 1983; Webb
1989; Zimmerman et al. 1994). The size, shape, and openness
of the crown may also be related to the extent of damage
(Curtis 1943). Foster (1988) found that full crowns were
more susceptible to wind compared with trees with a more
tapered shape. Dense-crowned trees have been found to be
more easily damaged compared with open-foliage crowns
(Curtis 1943; Everham and Brokaw 1996). This corresponds
to our Hurricane Andrew results in which pruned trees (with
more open and well-distributed crowns) were more windresistant than unpruned trees (Duryea et al. 1996). On a stand
level, Everham and Brokaw (1996) report that thinned forests
(especially recently thinned) are more vulnerable to high
winds because of increased wind flow in the canopy and the
absence of neighboring trees. Barry et al. (1993) summarize
wind resistance as being dependent on tree species and then
on five factors: wood strength, crown shape and size, extent
and depth of the root system, soil moisture conditions, and
shape of the stem.
Studies of urban tree response to hurricanes are not as
common yet have yielded interesting and useful results. After
Hurricane Hugo struck Puerto Rico in 1989, Francis and
Gillespie (1993) found that trees were more damaged with
increasing wind gust speed and increasing diameter. Palms
were significantly more resistant to wind than broad-leaved
trees. After Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico, Francis (2000)
found a correlation between tree size and defoliation and
crown loss. He also found differences in extent and type of
damage for 24 species in the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden. Trees with denser wood and greater branch
flexibility were less likely to snap or uproot (Francis 2000). A
windstorm that struck Guangzhou City in subtropical south
China in 1995 with winds up to 80 km/h (50 mph) damaged
over 1% of the tree canopy (Jim and Liu 1997). Tree species
differed in their susceptibility to the storm damage; vulnerable species tended to have lower wood density and wide
crowns with dense foliage. Shallow root systems also predisposed trees to uprooting in the winds (Jim and Liu 1997).
Hurricane Andrew with its 265 km/h (165 mph) winds took
38% of the urban trees in the Miami–Dade County area. In
addition to species differences in wind resistance, native trees
survived better than exotics (Duryea et al. 1996). Tree prun©2007 International Society of Arboriculture

ing, an important cultural practice, improved wind resistance
of three common species (live oak [Quercus virginiana],
black olive [Bucida buceras] and gumbo limbo [Bursera simarouba]). Observations from Hurricanes Camille (1969),
Frederick (1979), and Hugo (1989) have resulted in the development of species lists based on flood tolerance, breakage,
uprooting, salt, and deterioration by insects and disease (Touliatos and Roth 1971; Swain 1979; Barry et al. 1993).
The objectives of this study were to analyze the effects of
hurricane force winds on tree species growing in urban areas
in the southeastern United States coastal plain: (1) to determine if there was species-specific damage over the varied
wind speeds, and (2) to determine if damage was related to
tree attributes (such as size, leaf loss, wood density, and
crown shape) and site characteristics (trees growing in
groups).

METHODS
Urban Tree Damage Measurements
Urban tree damage was measured after (within 3 to 6 days)
each hurricane that struck the Florida panhandle (Erin, Opal,
Ivan, and Dennis) (Figure 1). We also report the hurricane
response of coastal plain species such as live oak and sabal
palm (Sabal palmetto) that occur throughout Florida and were
impacted by Hurricanes Andrew, Charley, Frances, and
Jeanne. Hurricane Andrew results were collected in a survey
of 128 homeowners in Dade County, Florida, who reported
the impacts of the hurricane on trees in their yards (Duryea et
al. 1996). The methodology for the other eight hurricanes was
the same and is as follows. Neighborhoods at the point of
landfall of the hurricane were randomly chosen on the strong

landfall. The maximum sustained wind speed (km/h and
mph) and year are included.

side of the storm. For each neighborhood, all trees in front
yards were observed along street transects. (If invited, we
also measured trees in backyards.) Overall, we sampled 100
neighborhoods and 18,200 trees. (Branch loss measurements
for Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne were combined and collected immediately after Hurricane Jeanne.)
Each tree’s diameter at breast height (for dicots and conifers) or height (for palms) was measured (estimated for
height) and then it was determined if the tree was standing,
leaning, or had fallen. Leaning trees were those that were
leaning as a result of the storm at less than a 45° angle. Fallen
trees were either broken at the main stem or lying on the
ground. All fallen trees were assessed as either broken or
uprooted. Percent survival was calculated for each species
using trees that were standing after the hurricane (Trees were
considered not surviving if they had fallen or if they were
leaning at less than a 45° angle.).
Crowns of all standing trees were first assessed for percent
branch loss and then for leaf loss from the hurricane. For
palms, only percent leaf loss was assessed. Then for dicots
and conifers, if a tree had 50% or greater branch loss from the
hurricane, it was declared dead and a new second survival
percentage was calculated. This is called the “recalculated
survival” throughout this article.
For each tree, we also estimated whether it had caused
damage to property either from a falling branch or the entire
tree. If it had damaged something, we recorded the type of
property (for example, fence, power line, or house).
To investigate the reasons why some trees are more windresistant than others, we looked at cluster plantings, wood
density, defoliation, and tree crown attributes. To analyze
cluster plantings, we assessed whether each tree was growing
in a group with other trees or by itself. We defined a cluster
as a group of five or more trees growing within 3 m (9.9 ft)
of each other (but not in a row). To investigate the relationship between wind damage and wood characteristics, we obtained wood density, modulus of rupture, and modulus of
elasticity for each of the tree species (Reyes et al. 1992;
Forest Products Laboratory 1999).
To relate crown characteristics to wind damage, we obtained information on crown density and growth form (excurrent versus decurrent) for each species. Crown density is
an estimate of the openness of the crown or the ratio of
positive and negative space within the crown (Hightshoe
1988; Gilman 2005). The growth form of a tree can be categorized as excurrent or decurrent. Excurrent trees have
strong apical dominance with the main trunk present throughout the life of the tree (giving rise to cone-shaped crowns with
a central trunk). Decurrent trees have lateral branches that
grow as rapidly as the central trunk; they have no dominant
main leader (Harris et al. 2004). We determined from the
literature and observation the density class and growth form
for each species and then compared open with moderate with

85

dense crowns for branch loss and survival (Hightshoe 1988;
Harris et al. 2004; Gilman 2005).
Maximum sustained wind speeds for each hurricane were
obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Hurricane Center web site (www.nhc.
noaa.gov).

The Survey
After four hurricanes struck Florida in 2004, we concluded
that urban forest professionals around Florida were a resource
of knowledge about wind resistance. In June 2005, we sent
out 240 surveys to arborists, urban foresters, and forest scientists who were members of either the International Society
of Arboriculture (Florida chapter) or the Florida Urban Forestry Council or faculty at the University of Florida asking
them to rank the wind resistance (high, medium, or low) of
those urban tree species they observed after hurricanes.
Eighty-five surveys (35%) were returned. We report these
numbers and percentages in this publication and then use
these ratings along with our measurements and analyses and
the scientific literature to formulate wind resistance lists for
tree species in urban areas.

Statistical Analysis
Data from all hurricanes were analyzed using the GLM, REG,
LOGISTIC, and FREQ procedures of SAS. Only species with
a sample size larger than or equal to 20 trees for each hurricane were included. PROC GLM was used for all survival
and branch loss analyses. Species survival was modeled using
species and neighborhoods with neighborhood considered a
random effect. The error term used was the interaction of
species and neighborhood. Multiple comparisons were used
to compare survival means among species. For native versus
exotic and cluster planting analyses, survival was modeled
using them as a categorical variable and neighborhood was
considered a random effect. The error term used was the
interaction of the categorical variable and neighborhood. A
t-test was used to compare survival with these variables. Frequency tables were used to describe if fallen trees were broken or uprooted and to describe property damage by species.
To analyze the relationship between leaf loss and survival,
a logistic regression was conducted using the PROC LOGISTIC procedures in SAS with survival as the dependent variable and percentage of leaf loss as the explanatory variable.
To determine if survival and branch damage were related to
wood density, wood densities were grouped into four categories using the GLM procedure in SAS. A multiple comparison test was done for survival and branch damage between
the categories.
A ␹2 test was used to compare survival and excurrent versus decurrent growth using the FREQ procedure in SAS.
Branch damage was modeled using SAS GLM, and a t-test
compared the two growth types. For crown density, ␹2 tests

were used to compare survival. Branch damage was modeled
using the GLM procedure in SAS with the particular crown
density, and t-tests were used to compare branch damage.
After comparing survival of palms and nonpalms, palms were
removed from these analyses.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall Urban Forest Loss
The percent of urban forest loss (mortality) was positively
correlated with wind speed (Figure 2). Francis and Gillespie
(1993) also related wind speed to urban tree damage from
Hurricane Hugo in Puerto Rico and found that at 50 km/h (31
mph), there was no damage compared with 80% damage at
125 km/h (78 mph) and 90% to 100% damage at 200 km/h
(124 mph). Some of the other factors that could explain the
variation of tree loss include the speed that the hurricane
moved through the area, soil conditions including soil depth
and moisture, and the overall tree canopy and its health. Hurricane damage in natural forest ecosystems in the Caribbean
has been found to be dependent on four factors: (1) the hurricane intensity including rainfall, (2) the storm size, (3) topography, and (4) the susceptibility of the ecosystem to damage (Tanner et al. 1991).

Tree Survival and Branch Loss
Tree species in the Southeastern Coastal Plain respond differently to hurricanes. Response of species to Hurricane Ivan
in 2004 illustrates differences at 209 km/h (130 mph) wind
speeds (Figure 3). Tree species demonstrating the highest
survival in these winds were sand live oak (Quercus geminata), American holly (Ilex opaca), southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), live oak, wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera),
sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), crapemyrtle (Lager-

stroemia indica), dogwood (Cornus florida), and sabal palm.
Dogwood, live oak, sabal palm, sand live oak, and southern
magnolia were also the best survivors in Hurricanes Erin and
Opal in 1995 (Duryea 1997). A more detailed look at live oak
and sabal palm demonstrates their repeated resilience to hurricane force winds (Table 1). However, it can also be seen
that in south Florida, when the winds reached 233 and 265
km/h (145 and 165 mph) in Hurricanes Charley and Andrew,
survival of live oak decreased to 78%. In a statistical comparison of sand live oak, live oak, and laurel oak, laurel oak
had poorer overall survival than both live oak and sand live
oak in four panhandle Florida hurricanes (P < 0.001) (Figure
4). In several publications, live oak, sabal palm, baldcypress
(Taxodium distichum), and pondcypress (Taxodium ascendens) have been ranked at the top of lists for hurricane-related
wind resistance (Touliatos and Roth 1971; Swain 1979; Barry
et al. 1993).
Branch loss in hurricanes may also be an important measure of their resilience (Figure 5). In Hurricane Ivan, southern
redcedar (Juniperus virginiana var. silicicola), sycamore
(Platanus occidentalis), southern red oak (Quercus falcata),
and laurel oak lost on average over 25% of their branches.
Sweetgum, silver maple (Acer saccharinum), sycamore, and
southern redcedar were species losing the most branches in
Hurricanes Erin and Opal (Duryea 1997). Species with 10%
or less branch loss were crapemyrtle, loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), American holly, and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). When we looked at tree diameter and branch loss,
large trees (100 to 200 cm [40 to 80 in] diameter) lost the
most branches (30%), then medium-sized trees (50 to 99 cm

more likely to be damaged directly by the wind compared
with smaller trees, which were more likely to be indirectly
damaged by other falling trees.
Because trees with large amounts of branch loss from a
hurricane may not be considered healthy urban trees, we reanalyzed survival taking into account branches lost. Standing
trees that had 50% or greater branch loss were called dead
and a “new” survival was calculated (Figure 6). Some species
with heavy branch loss had significantly lower recalculated
survival. Southern redcedar survival was decreased from 61%
to 46% as a result of heavy branch loss. Sycamore survival
was reduced from 73% to 52%. Even live oak trees had
significant branch loss and their survival was decreased from

91% to 81%. When we statistically compared the recalculated
survival of oak species after Hurricane Ivan, the ranking from
greatest to lowest survival was sand live oak (98% survival),
live oak (81%), laurel oak (66%), water oak (Quercus nigra)
(65%), and Southern red oak (50%) (P ⳱ 0.0001). A study in
South Carolina coastal plain forests after Hurricane Hugo
found that live oak was less damaged than laurel and water
oaks (Gresham et al. 1991).
Survival of pine species showed significant differences
with greatest survival for slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii) (71%), then loblolly (64%), longleaf (Pinus palustris)
(57%), sand pine (Pinus clausa) (43%), and spruce pine (Pinus glabra) (38%) (P ⳱ 0.0014). Three months after Hurricane Ivan, we remeasured pines and found that 2% to 3% of
the slash and longleaf standing trees had died and 56% of the
standing sand pine had died. In the southeastern coastal plain
forest, longleaf pine was less damaged than loblolly during
Hurricane Hugo (12% versus 73% damaged) (Gresham et al.
1991), but a tornado in Texas resulted in equal and intense
damage to loblolly, longleaf, and shortleaf (Pinus echinata)
pines (Glitzenstein and Harcombe 1988). Two conifer species
that have shown repeatedly poor performance in our studies
during hurricanes are sand pine and southern redcedar (Duryea 1997) (Table 1).

Some species have a tendency to break at the stem compared
with uprooting. In Hurricane Ivan, pecan (Carya illinoensis),
sand pine, and sabal palm tended to uproot more than break
(83%, 77%, and 90% uprooted, respectively). The other pines
both uprooted and broke. This is in contrast to Hurricane

Andrew in which 90% of the south Florida slash pine (Pinus
elliottii var. densa) that fell broke (Duryea et al. 1996). Van
Hooser and Hedlund (1969) also found that pines tended to
snap compared with uprooting for broadleaf species. In tropical species, Putz et al. (1983) found that species with shorter,
thicker stems and denser wood tended to uproot rather than to
snap. However, in our study, when it did fall (only 9% of the
live oaks), live oak with its dense wood (0.8 g/cm3) equally
uprooted or broke.

Property Damage
Twenty percent (20%) of the trees that fell damaged property
in Hurricane Ivan. Of these, 74% damaged major property
(house, power lines, screened enclosures, automobiles, and so
on) and 26% damaged minor property (fences, sheds, sidewalks). Ten percent of the total damage was to power lines.
The tree species causing the most damage were pines, pecan,
tulip poplar, and laurel and water oaks. In Hurricanes Erin
and Opal, laurel oak, longleaf pine, sand pine, and slash pine
caused the most damage (between 11% and 18% damage)
and smaller species such as laurelcherry (Prunus caroliniana)
and southern redcedar caused the least damage (Duryea
1997).

What Makes a Tree More Wind-Resistant?
The goal of this research project is to attempt to determine
what biological and cultural factors make trees more or less
wind-resistant. By evaluating these factors, we can understand the differences between species (i.e., whether they have
dense wood or defoliate quickly in wind) and between certain
practices (such as planting trees in groups compared with
individual tree plantings), which could result in a healthier
and more wind-resistant urban forest.
Defoliation
There were distinct species differences in defoliation during
Hurricane Ivan. Species such as sand live oak, crapemyrtle,
and dogwood lost an average of 94%, 88%, and 86%, respectively, of their leaves compared with southern redcedar, wax
myrtle, slash pine, longleaf pine, and loblolly pine, which lost
32%, 31%, 29%, 19%, and 11% of their leaves, respectively
(least significant difference ⳱ 17%). Leaf loss had a positive

relationship (P < 0.0001) with both survival and recalculated
survival (trees with ⱖ50% branch loss excluded); in other
words, losing leaves during the hurricane meant higher survival. Francis and Gillespie (1993), reporting on urban trees
in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, also found that
crown damage appeared to be avoided if the crown surface
area was reduced quickly with leaf and twig loss during the
hurricane. There are some exceptions to defoliation being a
strategy for survival; southern magnolia, American holly, and
sabal palm are all excellent survivors but they only lost 43%,
34%, and 27% of their leaves, respectively.
Native and Exotic Species
In the coastal plain area, exotic tree species made up 8% of
the trees in the urban forest. The major exotic species were
crapemyrtle, Chinese tallow (Sapium sebiferum) (a prohibited
invasive species), camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora)
(an invasive species), Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana), and
palms such as pindo palm (Butia capitata) and Washington
fan palm (Washingtonia robusta). As a group, native trees
survived the same as exotic trees (73% versus 77%, not significantly different [NS] and lost the same amount of
branches (20% versus 15%, NS) and leaves (58% versus
60%, NS). In contrast, after Hurricane Andrew struck south
Florida, native trees survived winds better than nonnative
trees (Duryea et al. 1996). Other studies have shown trends
toward increased wind damage of exotic species in rural plantation forests (King 1945; Everham and Brokaw 1996).
Wood Characteristics
In a comparison of wood density and wind resistance, we
found that tree species with higher wood density (g/cm3) had
greater survival in Hurricane Ivan (Table 2). When trees with
50% or greater branch damage were also included as nonsurvivors and a new percent survival was calculated, this recalculated survival was also greater with higher wood density.
Differences in branch loss for various wood densities were
not as apparent (Table 2). In a study with 24 tropical species
in Puerto Rico, Francis (2000) also found that trees were less
likely to fail by uprooting or breakage if they had higher
wood density. In addition, similar to our study in which live
oak with a wood density of 0.8 has a high survival rate, Hook

et al. (1991) noted that the strong wood of live oak resulted
in lost branches only and little windthrow during Hurricane
Hugo in South Carolina. Putz et al. (1983) found that tree
species with shorter, thicker stems and denser wood tended to
uproot instead of break and that species with low-density
wood had higher mortality.
Two other measurements of wood strength are the modulus
of elasticity (Young’s elastic modulus) and the modulus of
rupture. The modulus of elasticity measures the wood’s stiffness; after applying a certain weight (in MPa), it measures
whether the wood recovers to its original position (Forest
Products Laboratory 1999; Niklas 1999). Tree species with
the highest modulus of elasticity (>7,000 MPa) survived Hurricane Ivan better than those with the lowest values (<7,000
MPa) (Table 3). Examples of species with the highest modulus of elasticity are slash pine, longleaf pine, sand live oak,
and live oak (10,500, 11,000, 10,900, and 10,900 MPa, respectively). Those with the lowest modulus of elasticity are
southern redcedar and spruce pine (6,410 and 6,900 MPa).
Branch loss did not appear to be related. Niklas (1999) compared young black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) with older
trees and found that younger trees were less stiff and strong
as a result of the different proportions of primary and secondary tissues as trees age.
Modulus of rupture is a measure of the bending stress that
wood can experience without mechanically failing (Forest
Products Laboratory 1999; Niklas 1999). Results from Hurricane Ivan show that survival was highest for those species
with the highest modulus of rupture (ⱖ70,000 kPa), whereas
branch loss showed no relationship (Table 4). Examples of

species with low survival rates that have a low modulus of
rupture were tulip poplar, spruce pine, and sycamore (41,000,
41,000, and 45,000 kPa). However, some species with high
survival also have a low modulus of rupture (southern magnolia [47,000 kPa] and sweetgum [49,000 kPa]). Live oak
and sand live oak represent the highest modulus of rupture
category with 82,000 kPa. In a study with Scots pine (Pinus
sylvestris), Skatter and Kucera’s (2000) results supported the
modulus of rupture as important to a tree’s susceptibility to
wind.
Crown Characteristics
Crown density is an estimate of the openness of the crown or
the ratio of positive and negative space within the crown
(Hightshoe 1988; Gilman 2005). We determined from the
literature and observation the density class of each species
and then compared open with moderate with dense crowns
for branch loss and survival (Hightshoe 1988; Gilman 2005).
Dense crowns had significantly greater survival than moderate or open crowns (84% versus 74% versus 67%) (P <
0.0001). When we recalculated survival (excluding trees with
50% or greater branch loss), the relationship was still the
same and significant (75%, 68%, and 62%) (P < 0.0001). In
contrast to our survival results, Foster (1988) concluded that
after a catastrophic wind in New England, tree species with
full crowns and shallow roots were more susceptible than
those with a vertical distribution of canopy, flexible branches,
and tapering shape. In their literature review, Everham and
Brokaw (1996) summarized that there is a tendency for
dense-crowned trees to be damaged and open-foliage crowns

n is the number of respondents for each species out of a total of 85 experts. P values from the ␹2 test for equal proportions indicate the significance level for

to be spared. Our results did agree with the literature for
branch damage; tree species with dense crowns lost more
branches (24% branch loss) than those with moderate and
open crowns (19% and 18%) (P < 0.0001). Some of the
dense-crown species are live oak, sand live oak, laurel oak,
American holly, and Bradford pear. Red maple (Acer rubrum), dogwood, crapemyrtle, sweetgum, southern magnolia,
water oak, and red oak have moderately dense crowns. Examples of open crowns are the pines, pecan, southern redcedar, and wax myrtle.
The growth form of a tree can be categorized as excurrent
or decurrent. Excurrent trees have strong apical dominance
with the main trunk present throughout the life of the tree
(giving rise to cone-shaped crowns with a central trunk).
Decurrent trees have lateral branches that grow as rapidly as
the central trunk; they have no dominant main leader (Harris
et al. 2004). Decurrent trees had significantly higher survival
(80%) compared with excurrent trees (69%). Recalculated
survival (excluding those with heavy branch loss) of decurrent species was less different than excurrent trees but it was
still significant (72% versus 64%, P ⳱ 0.0005). However,

decurrent species experienced more branch damage than excurrent (22% versus 17%, P < 0.0001). Examples of decurrent trees in the southeastern coastal plain are pecan, dogwood, crapemyrtle, oaks, and wax myrtle. Excurrent trees
include pines, American holly, sweetgum, southern redcedar,
tulip poplar, and southern magnolia.
Trees Growing in Groups
We hypothesized that trees growing in groups or clusters
might survive hurricane force winds better. A group was
defined as five or more trees each growing within 3 m of
another tree (but not in a row). Trees growing in groups had
80% survival during Hurricane Ivan compared with 70% for
those growing as individual trees (P ⳱ 0.0002). Trees growing in groups also lost significantly more leaves than individual trees (63% leaf loss versus 55%, P ⳱ 0.0001). Branch
loss, however, was the same for trees in groups and individuals (19% and 20%, NS).

The Survey
Arborists’ and urban foresters’ ratings of wind resistance for
coastal plain species show a strong agreement with our mea-

Arboriculture & Urban Forestry 33(2): March 2007

surements over several hurricanes. Small trees that were
awarded high wind resistance ratings were fringe tree (Chionanthus virginicus), dogwood, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboretum), and the hollies (Ilex spp.) (Table 5). Although live oak and sand live oak were rated as high, other
oaks such as southern red oak and swamp chestnut oak
(Quercus michauxii) were rated as medium and, in agreement
with our results, laurel and water oaks were rated as having
low wind resistance. Although we have consistently seen
southern redcedar to have low survival or heavy branch damage, the ratings were very even for each of the wind-resistant
categories in the survey results. However, 91% of the respondents rated baldcypress and pondcypress with high wind resistance. Both cypresses were stated to have the best wind
resistance along with live oak and sabal palm after Hurricanes
Camille and Frederick struck the Gulf Coast in 1969 and
1979 (Swain 1979). In the survey, sand pine received a low
rating, which is consistent with our results, whereas the other
pines mostly were rated as medium, again consistent with our
results. Everham and Brokaw (1996) in their summarizing list

93

of wind resistance for forest species cite 10 studies in which
loblolly, slash, and longleaf pines are ranked with low to
intermediate wind resistance. Sabal palm received a high
wind-resistant rating from 99% of the survey respondents in
agreement with our ratings and those of Swain (1979). One
palm, Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), which
is being planted more frequently in north Florida, received a
high rating from 89% of the respondents.
Sweetgum was rated as medium to high wind resistance by
respondents; in a summary table of wind resistance by Everham and Brokaw (1996), seven studies rated sweetgum as
medium to high wind resistance. Our studies have shown that
it survives well but is prone to some branch breakage. In a
Texas study after a tornado, sweetgum was listed as one of
the best survivors but also a tree with the most branch damage
(Glitzenstein and Harcombe 1988). In a study after Hurricane
Kate in 1985, sweetgum had low mortality (2%) in a southern
mixed hardwood forest compared with spruce pine with 34%
mortality (Batista and Platt 2003). They note that windfirmness of sweetgum is likely the result of its underground
connections, short and stout branches, and leaves with slender

long petioles that readily detach from branches in wind. On
gravelly ridges, hillsides, and upland piedmont sites, sweetgum has been noted to develop a particularly strong tap root
and is very resistant to wind (Kormanik 1990).
Tulip poplar had very poor survival in Hurricane Ivan
(24%). Respondents from the survey rated it as medium to
low wind resistance. Everham and Brokaw (1996) summarize
two studies in their table with high levels of wind damage for
tulip poplar in high-intensity storms.

IMPLICATIONS FOR ARBORICULTURE AND
URBAN FORESTRY
Taking our survival and branch loss results from hurricanes
and incorporating results from the survey and from the scientific literature, we have developed lists of relative wind
resistance for tree species in the southeastern coastal plain
(Figure 7). These lists should be used with caution with the
knowledge that no species and no tree is completely windproof. In addition, local considerations such as soil, cultural
practices, tree age and health, and other urban forest health
conditions need to be taken into account. In addition to hur-

ricane wind speed, other conditions accompanying hurricanes
such as precipitation and the speed in which they move
through an area appear to influence tree response.
Additional recommendations for establishing new trees include:
• Planting a mixture of species, ages, and layers (shrubs
and trees) to maintain diversity in your community;
• Planting trees from the “highest” and “medium-high”
wind resistance lists and matching these to local site
conditions;
• Giving trees adequate rooting space with no obstructions
(e.g., sidewalks, buildings, streets);
• For small trees, provide at least 3 m (9.9 ft) by 3 m (9.9
ft);
• For large trees, provide at least 10 m (33 ft) by 10 m (33
ft);
• Considering planting tree in groups as opposed to individually;
• Considering soil properties when deciding what to plant
(e.g., soil depth, water table depth, and compaction); and

Arboriculture & Urban Forestry 33(2): March 2007

• Giving trees adequate aerial space considering their
crown size when mature.
Recommendations for managing established trees include:
• Having tree health evaluated and removing hazard trees;
• Considering removing trees that are on the “lowest wind
resistance” list, especially if they are overmature and
endangering life or property;
• Establishing a regular structural pruning program (especially for dicots);
• Not overpruning palms, especially before a hurricane;
palms only need to have dead or dying leaves removed;
• Being aware of possible root damage (and lack of anchoring) when construction has resulted in sidewalks or
trenches near the roots of trees;
• Avoiding damage to the trunk of the tree (e.g., mechanical weed control damage); and
• Consulting with an ISA-Certified Arborist.

Résumé. Plusieurs ouragans ont frappé la Floride en 2004 et
2005, causant de vastes dommages aux zones urbaines et rurales.
Nous avons mesuré les impacts de cinq de ces ouragans sur la forêt
urbaine et combinés ces résultats avec quatre autres ouragans afin de
présenter une évaluation de la résistance au vent pour les espèces
d’arbres de la plaine côtière du Sud-est des États-Unis. La perte au
sein de la forêt urbaine était largement corrélée avec la vitesse du
vent. Les espèces d’arbres qui ont démontré la plus grande résistance
à survivre face aux vents ont été le Quercus geminata, le Ilex opaca,
le Magnolia grandiflora, le Quercus virginiana, le Myrica cerifera,
le Liquidambar styraciflua, le Lagerstroemia indica, le Cornus
florida et le Sabal palmetto. Dans une comparaison statistique du
taux de survie après quatre ouragans côtiers entre le Q. geminata, le
Q. virginiana et le Q. laurifolia, le Q. laurifolia a eu le plus faible
taux de survie par rapport aux deux autres. Parmi toutes les espèces,
les arbres de grande taille ont perdu plus de branches que les arbres
de moyenne ou petite taille. La perte en feuilles a été en relation
positive avec le taux de survie – la perte de feuilles durant l’ouragan
a résulté en un plus grand taux de survie. Les arbres poussant en
groupes ou en bosquets ont eu un taux de survie plus élevé que ceux
poussant individuellement. Les espèces d’arbres avec une densité en
bois plus élevée ont eu un meilleur taux de survie. Les espèces
d’arbres classées comme ayant une cime plus dense ont perdu plus
de branches que celles avec une cime plus faible ou clairsemée;
cependant, contrairement à ce qui est affirmé dans la littérature, les
espèces avec une cime plus dense ont mieux survécu. Un inventaire
fait par des arboriculteurs, des scientifiques et des forestiers urbains
a permis de classifier les espèces selon leur résistance au vent. En
utilisant les résultats provenant de nos mesures des ouragans et en
les incorporant avec ceux provenant de l’inventaire et les données de
la littérature scientifique, nous avons développé une liste de résistance relative au vent pour les espèces de la plaine côtière du Sudest. Ces listes devraient être utilisées avec précaution, et ce du fait
qu’aucune espèce ou aucun arbre n’est totalement insensible au vent.
De plus, d’autres aspects locaux, tels le sol, les pratiques culturales,
l’âge et la santé de l’arbre ainsi que les autres aspects de la forêt
urbaine doivent être pris en compte.
Zusammenfassung. 2004 und 2005 wurde Florida von mehreren
Stürmen heimgesucht, die in weiten Landesteilen große Zerstörung
anrichteten. Wir haben die Auswirkungen von fünf dieser Stürme
auf die urbanen Wälder gemessen und diese Ergebnisse mit vier

Arboriculture & Urban Forestry 33(2): 2007

anderen Stürmen verbunden, um eine Untersuchung der Windresistenz von Baumarten der amerikanischen Südostküste zu präsentieren. Der Verlust an urbanen Wäldern wurde positiv korreliert mit
der Windgeschwindigkeit. Die Bäume mit der größten Überlebensrate waren: Quercus geminata, Ilex opaca, Magnolia grandiflora,
Quercus virginiana, Myrica cerifera, Liquidambar styraciflua, Lagerstroemia indica, Cornus florida und Sabal palmetto. In einem
statistischen Vergleich von Q. geminata, Q. virginiana und Q. laurifolia nach vier heftigen Wirbelstürmen zeigte die Lorbeereiche
eine deutlich niedrigere Überlebensrate als die beiden anderen Eichen. Von allen Arten verloren im Vergleich die größeren Bäume
mehr Äste als die mittleren und kleineren Baumarten. Der Blattverlust hatte eine positive Korrelation mit der Überlebensrate: ein Verlust der Blätter während des Sturmes verhieß größeres Überleben
nach dem Sturm. Bäume, die in kleineren oder größeren Gruppen
wuchsen, hatten eine größere Überlebenschance als Einzelbäume.
Baumarten mit naturgemäß dichten Kronen verloren mehr Äste als
Baumarten mit mittleren oder offenen Kronenhabitus. Dennoch, im
Gegensatz zur Literatur hatten dichtbekronte Bäume eine höhere
Überlebensrate. In einer Umfrage unter Arboristen, Wissenschaftlern und Forstleuten wurden Baumarten auf ihre Windresistenz bewertet. Mit den Ergebnissen unserer Sturmmessungen, den
Ergebnissen der Umfrage und der wissenschaftlichen Literatur entwickelten wir eine Liste von relativem Windwiderstand für
Baumarten entlang der Südostküste Amerikas. Diese Listen könne
unter dem Vorbehalt verwendet werden, dass keine Art und kein
Baum komplett windresistent ist. Zusätzliche Standortbedingungen,
wie Boden, Kulturart, Baumalter und Gesundheit sowie andere urbane Forstverhältnisse müssen mit einbezogen werden.
Resumen. Varios huracanes golpearon Florida en 2004 y 2005
causando extensos daños a las áreas rurales y urbanas. Se midieron
los impactos de cinco de estos huracanes en el bosque urbano y se
combinaron estos resultados con otros cuatro huracanes para pre-

sentar una evaluación de la resistencia del viento para especies de
árboles de las planicies costeras del sureste del los EU. La pérdida
de bosque urbano estuvo correlacionada positivamente con la velocidad del viento. Las especies de árboles que demostraron la más
alta supervivencia en los vientos fueron los encinos (Quercus geminata y Quercus virginiana), holly americano (Ilex opaca), magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), mirica de cera (Myrica cerifera), liquidámbar (Liquidambar styraciflua), astronómica (Lagerstroemia indica),
cornus (Cornus florida) y palma sabal (Sabal palmetto). En comparación estadística de los encinos y el encino laurel (Quercus laurifolia), después de cuatro fuertes huracanes, el encino laurel tuvo
una menor supervivencia, significativamente más pobre, que los dos
encinos evaluados. Entre todas las especies, los árboles grandes
perdieron más ramas que los medianos y pequeños. La pérdida de
hojas tuvo una relación positiva con la supervivencia – pérdida de
hojas durante el huracán, significativamente con más alta supervivencia. Los árboles creciendo en grupos tuvieron más alta supervivencia que los árboles aislados. Las especies de árboles con densidad de madera más alta tuvieron mayor supervivencia. Las especies de árboles en categorías de densidades de copa mayores
perdieron más ramas que aquellos con copas moderadas o abiertas;
sin embargo, contrariamente a la literatura, las especies de copas
densas supervivieron mejor. Una encuesta de arboristas, científicos
y dasónomos urbanos clasificaron las especies por su resistencia al
viento. Empleando los resultados de este estudio e incorporándolos
a los de la encuesta y la literatura científica, se han desarrollado
listas de resistencia relativa al viento para especies de árboles en las
planicies costeras del sureste. Estas listas deberían ser usadas con
precaución, con el conocimiento de que no todas las especies y no
todos los árboles están completamente protegidos contra los vientos.
Además de consideraciones locales tales como suelos, prácticas culturales, edad del árbol y salud, otras condiciones del bosque urbano
necesitan ser tomadas en cuenta.
