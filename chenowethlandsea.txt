THE SAN DIEGO HURRICANE

OF 2 OCTOBER 1858

BY MICHAEL CHENOWETH AND CHRISTOPHER LANDSEA

The discovery of a hurricane that directly impacted San Diego, California,

nearly 150 yr ago has implications for residents and risk managers

in their planning for extreme events for the region.

T ropical cyclones forming in the eastern North

Pacific Ocean are occasional visitors to the
southwestern United States. By the time these
systems travel far enough to the north to bring their
associated moisture to the United States, the tropical
cyclones have normally diminished below tropical
storm strength over Mexico or over the colder waters
of the California Current that flows southward along
the California coast. Rain, sometimes locally excessive,
is frequently observed in many areas of the southwest-
ern United States when tropical cyclone remnants en-
ter the region (Blake 1935; Smith 1986).

Four tropical cyclones have managed to bring tropi-
cal stormforce winds to the southwestern United
States during the twentieth century: a tropical storm
on 25 September 1939 in California, Hurricane Joanne
on 6 October 1972 in Arizona, Hurricane Kathleen on

10 September 1976 in California and Arizona, and
Hurricane Nora in September 1997 in Arizona. Only
the 1939 tropical storm made a direct landfall in coastal
California (Smith 1986), because the other three sys-
tems entered the United States after first making land-
fall in Mexico.

The 1939 tropical storm caused $2 million in prop-
erty damage in California, mostly to shipping, shore
structures, power and communication lines, and crops.
Ships in coastal waters of southern California reported
southeast winds between 34 and 47 kt (Hurd 1939).
However, no tropical cyclones are recorded or esti-
mated to have made landfall in the southwestern
United States as a hurricane, with maximum 1-min
surface (10 m) winds of at least 64 kt. A list of the docu-
mented tropical cyclone remnants to affect the south-
western United States can be found in Smith (1986).
Extreme rain events in the southwestern United
States and heavy rains are the most frequent effect of
tropical cyclones in the region. High winds and coastal
stormsurge and wave action are much less frequent.
Smith (1986) states: The occurrence of sustained winds
of even hurricane intensity, 65 kn[ots], is extremely
unlikely anywhere in the Southwest.

Recently, the first author discovered the existence
of a hurricane at San Diego, California, on 2 October
1858 in newspaper accounts from California. This hur-
ricane is perhaps not unknown to local historians of
the area, but its existence has been unknown or apocry-

phal at best, to the meteorology community until now.
The existence of this hurricane and its damaging effects
on land are of interest to meteorologists interested in
the unique alignment of atmospheric events that
brought such a powerful storm so near to land. Prop-
erty insurers, local governments, and others interested
in risk assessment may well find a need to reconsider
the risks for a hurricane strike in southern California.
In this paper, we present the newspaper accounts
of the storm in southern California. To these reports
we add the meteorological observations for the region
made by the U.S. Army, U.S. Coast Survey, and pri-
vate individuals to reconstruct the large-scale synoptic
pattern. Damage reports are examined in respect to
methods for estimating wind speed from poststorm
surveys of the resulting damage caused by tropical cy-
clones and tornadoes. The merging of all data sources
leaves no doubt as to the tropical origin of this storm.
Documentation of a northeast Pacific hurricane to
impact San Diego parallels ongoing efforts to reana-

lyze the Atlantic basin hurricane database (Landsea et al.
2004a). This work seeks to go back in time and to re-
visit and revise, if necessary, the official tracks and in-
tensities of tropical storms and hurricanes from 1851
to the present. Currently, alterations and additions
have been made for the period of 18511910, as well
as for 1992s Hurricane Andrew (Landsea et al. 2004b).

DATA SOURCES. Data sources include microfilm
copies of daily weather observations made by the U.S.
Army medical staff at the various army posts through-
out the United States (Fleming 1989), microfilm cop-
ies of California newspapers, and original U.S. Coast
survey notebooks. The U.S. Army and U.S. Coast
Survey notebooks are kept at the U.S. National Ar-
chives in College Park, Maryland. Newspaper records
are held by the U.S. Library of Congress Newspaper
Library.

Newspaper accounts from the Daily Alta California
(San Francisco) and the Los Angeles Star provide the

only surviving records. However, the Daily Alta Cali-
fornia carried press items from other newspapers, in-
cluding the San Diego Herald, providing crucial details
on the storm.

Survey notebooks of the U.S. Coast Survey were
consulted, but no data for October 1858 were found.
Likewise, a check of Comprehensive OceanAtmosphere
Data Set (COADS) marine data (Woodruff et al. 1987)
from the region did not provide any information on
the hurricanes origin or subsequent track. Figure 1
depicts a map of the western United States and the
location of U.S. Army, and other locations where daily
weather observations are available for October 1858.

METHODS. We compiled all available weather data
and produced thrice-daily weather maps (0700, 1400,
and 2100 LT) for each day from 1 to 3 October 1858.
The shipping news from the newspapers and COADS
did not provide data with ship positions (newspapers)
or data in the region (COADS) so that the analysis is
based on land observations only. Data from Mexico
are not available except in the southern reaches of the
country at Mirador (near Vera Cruz on the Gulf of
Mexico coast). Barometric pressure data for Sacra-
mento (3835 N, 12128 W), San Francisco (3748 N,
12225 W), and New San Diego (3241 N, 11713 W)
were adjusted for elevation, instrument temperature,
and standard gravity (List 1951). These readings should
be considered reliable only with a 24 mb uncertainty
because metadata are not complete or independently
confirmed.1 Wind-force estimates, based upon visual
observations at U.S. Army posts, were made accord-
ing to a scale included in the printed form used for
recording daily weather observations (Table 1). Some
caution is required in interpreting these values with
reference to modern values. Because the modern defi-
nition of wind speed in the United States is based on
instrumental 1-min averages, and the methods used
in the mid-nineteenth century are unknown, the val-
ues cannot be considered equivalent. Additionally, ac-

1 List (1951) is used for the reduction of the mercury column to
standard temperature (16.7C). The attached thermometer
readings were from 18 to 27C, which gives a range of
corrections between 3.3 and 4.7 mb. The correction for
standard gravity for the latitude of San Diego is between 0.7
and 1.0 mb. These two adjustments overwhelm the positive
correction of +0.3 mb for the stated sea level elevation of the
station. Because we do not have confirmation if this is the
ground or barometer cistern elevation above sea level, along
with no information on instrument errors and other basic
metadata, we assume a minimum uncertainty of 24 mb in
the derived values.

curate reference frames for wind calibration were not
generally available in the mid-nineteenth century. As
late as 1890, the highest standard velocity for calibra-
tion was 35 mph by whirling machine (Ferguson and
Covert 1924). The low frequency of hurricane-force
winds also makes it difficult to subjectively estimate
wind speed without the aid of instruments.

We use the SaffirSimpson hurricane scale of wind
speed (Saffir 1973; Simpson 1974) and the Fujita scale
(Fujita 1971) to equate typical destructive effects of
high wind speeds on land to independently estimate
the wind speed at San Diego. These estimates take into
consideration modifications of Fujitas original system
used in more recent research of hurricane damage
(Boose et al. 2001). Other weather elements, such as
temperature, are given as recorded but, because the
temperature readings were made in nonstandard ex-
posures (Chenoweth 1993), there is a potential for
a warm bias in daytime temperatures due to radia-
tion reaching unscreened thermometers. At night,
these biases are smaller unless artificial heat reaches
the instrument.

The general absence of pressure data, and the varied
topography of the western United States, makes the daily
weather map analysis incomplete but the best possible
from available sources. We follow principles of airmass
continuity used in modern synoptic surface analysis in
the mapping of the weather reports (Carlson 1991).

About 11 oclock A.M. of Saturday, 2d instant, a ter-
rific gale sprung up from the S.S.E. and continued
with perfect fury until about 5 P.M., when it some-
what abated, and rain commenced to fall. It blew with
such violence, and the air was filled with such dense
clouds of dust, that it was impossible to see across the
Plaza, and it was with the greatest difficulty that pe-
destrians could walk the streets. The damage to prop-
erty was considerable; houses were unroofed and
blown down, trees uprooted, and fences destroyed. It
is said to have been the severest gale ever witnessed in
San Diego.

The schooner Plutus, Capt. Vernon, dragged her an-
chor and went ashore on the beach.
The schooner Lovely Flora was also blown high and
dry on the beach.
The schooner X. L. on the ways, repairing, was blown
over and somewhat injured.
The Clarissa Andrews and Teresa rode out the gale
without damage.

So fearful was the gale at Point Loma, the Lighthouse
Keeper, Capt. Keating, was obliged to leave at 12
oclock, M., fearing the tower would fall. No damage,
however, was done. The roof of the house of Don
Mattias Moreno was blown off, and carried some dis-
tance into a neighboring corral, but fortunately no
damage was done to the inmates or the furniture of
the house.

The portico of the Kiln House, on the south side, was
torn down, the roof stripped of its rine covering and
the house otherwise materially damaged. Pieces of the
heavy roofing were blown several hundred yards away
from the building.

The windmill, recently constructed by Mr. Geo. P.
Tolman, on Mission Point, was almost entirely de-
molished, nothing remaining but the shaft and one
of the fans. Mr. Tolmans loss is considerable.

The house of Andrew Kriss, on the flat, was com-
pletely destroyed. Great damage was also done to the
fences and walls of different enclosures in town.

The next day, the Daily Alta Californias (14 Octo-
ber 1858) own correspondent in San Diego filed the
following report:

One of the most terrific and violent hurricanes that
has ever been noticed by the inhabitants of our quiet
city, visited us on Saturday the 2d inst., at daylight;

the appearance of weather was ominous, and por-
tended a sudden change of some extraordinary char-
acter; about 7 1-2 oclock, A.M., we had a slight
shower of rain with the wind from S.S.E. Soon after
this I am informed by the gentlemanly keeper of the
tide gauge in this place, (who has a very fine and
sensitive barometer, furnished him by the govern-
ment, through those who have charge of the tidal
observations), that the barometer went almost im-
mediately down several degrees lower than has ever
been known in this vicinity. From this time until 11
1-2 oclock, A.M., the wind gradually increased, and
the whole heavens seemed closing in with bank upon
bank of dark, heavy, ominous-looking clouds, fleet-
ing pretty close down to the ground, before the in-
creasing gale. About the time above mentioned sev-
eral very heavy gusts of wind came driving madly
along, completely filling the whole atmosphere with
thick and impenetrable clouds of dust and sand, so
much so, that one who was in the street could no
more see around him than if he was surrounded by
an Egyptian darkness; this continued for a consider-
able length of time, the violence of the wind still
increasing, until about one oclock, when it came
along in a perfect hurricane, tearing down houses
and everything that was in its way. Roofs of houses,
trees, fences, &c., &c., filled the air in all directions,
doing a large amount of damage, in and about the
city, and its immediate vicinity. From this time un-
til dark a continuance of the above was experienced,
interspersed now and then by a crash of some house,
tree, fence, or something of the kind; with the sun
the wind went down; during the night we had a con-
siderable fall of rain, which made a very pleasant
change. The streets, alleys, and roads, from a distance
as far as yet heard from, were swept as clean as if a
thousand brooms had been laboriously employed for
months. The scenes of the next day were unpleasant
to witness; persons were standing here and there in
groups, discussing and relating the effects of the
storm, and the private injuries or losses sustained by
them.

The next location to feel the effects of the (dimin-
ishing) hurricane was San Pedro (3343 N, 11817 W),
the port for Los Angeles (3402 N, 11814 W). Accord-
ing to the Los Angeles Star (9 October 1858),

The rains of the beginning of this week were unac-
companied with heavy winds here, but at San Pedro a
regular south-easter came up, doing considerable in-
jury to the small craft anchored in the Bay. We are
sorry to say, that Mr. Bannings famous yacht

Medora suffered from the envious winds and waves,
whose swiftest course she had frequently outrun. Lay-
ing quietly at anchor, they rose in their might against
her, drove her from her moorings on to the beach,
where they prevailed against her and broke her up,
scattering her fragments on the shore. A large barge
was also broken up; another, having dragged its an-
chor a considerable distance, was brought by the an-
chor fastening against a rock. The wharf at San Pedro
was very much injured, a large part of the flooring
having been carried away by the violence of the sea.

A large quantity of lumber stored on the beach was
floated off by the high tide and the violence of the
storm.

The storm of Saturday and Sunday last (October 2
and 3), we understand, was not general. It did not
extend far up the coast. It was unknown at San Luis
Obispo [3517 N 12040 W] and scarcely felt at Santa
Barbara [3428 N 11951 W].

In a follow-up item, the Star (16 October 1858) re-

ported

The late rains caused very little damage, we have been
informed, to the new cutting on the San Fernando
hill. A part of the embankment washed off a little, of
course, but a hundred dollars will defray the cost of
restoring it. The other portions have been improved
by the rain.

We understand that Bannings clipper yacht, the fa-
mous Medora, was not utterly demolished by the
late storm and that he intends to have it repaired.

At Los Angeles itself, heavy rain was a problem. The

Star noted (16 October 1858)

On Saturday morning last, about two oclock, rain
commenced falling, and shortly after became a per-
fect pour down, continuing all day and night, not
clearing off till after daylight on Sunday morning.
Such a heavy rain has not been experienced here since
last Christmas. The earth soon became thoroughly
saturated, and the water poured down from the hill
sides, flooding the streets.

Considerable inconvenience was experienced, and
some damages sustained, from leaky roofs. Many were
roused from their beds by the intrusive shower, and as
the visit was rather prolonged, rooms were flooded
and the occupants turned out.

We perceive, in various parts of the town, marks of
the effects of the storm. The adobe walls have suffered
a good dealsome having, fallen down, and others
so much injured as to necessitate removal.

The embankment lately erected by the city for the
new canal, was so much injured as to prevent the wa-
ter flowing in the canal.

It was feared that great damage had been sustained by
the grape crop, but we are glad to say that the rain
caused no injury in this respect

The copious rains will prove most beneficial to the
country at large, as farmers will commence plough-
ing, and be enabled to get in their grain crops in due
seasona circumstance which has not occurred for
several years.

Already the beneficial effects of the rain are observ-
able everywhere. Indeed, before the clouds had ceased
yielding their fructifying showers, the earth, under
their genial influence, began to develop its vegetat-
ing powers, and now the hills and plains are covered
by a carpet of beautiful green.

The Los Angeles Vineyard report, carried in the
Daily Alta California (22 October 1858), reported ad-
ditional details from the region:

The storm commenced in Los Angeles at 3 oclock
A.M., on the 2d, and continued with slight intermis-
sion for twenty-four hours. At this place there was but
little wind during the storm, although in all directions,
at only a short distance from the city, the rain was
preceded or accompanied with fresh gales.

At the Monte [possibly El Monte, located east of Los
Angeles at 3404 N 11803 W] the gale was severe,
prostrating corn and trees.

At Visalia [3608 N 11914 W] about 200 miles N.W.
from here, it commenced raining about 3 oclock
A.M., of the 2d, and continued until about 4 P.M.,
with but little wind. At the Tejon [3455 N 11853 W
or 3448 N 11852 W] the rain continued on the 3d
till evening. The quantity of water which fell was un-
usually great, being estimated by those who had op-
portunities of judging pretty correctly, at seven
inches.

The thermometer had ranged remarkably high at this
place for a fortnight previously, frequently going

above 100 in the shade. The nights also were uncom-
monly warm, the thermometer seldom falling below
70, and for a number of nights remained at 78.
Throughout the storm the thermometer was from 75
to 80. Within the past twenty-seven years, which we
have been conversant with this locality, there has been
no storm, which afforded so much water so early in
the autumn. It is worthy of notice that though the
wind was blowing a gale at San Diego during this
storm, yet the rain did not commence till 5 P.M. on
the 2d, whereas the rain began at Los Angeles at 3
A.M. of the same day.

The asymmetric structure to the rainfall may be
indicative of a vertically sheared tropical cyclone (with
more precipitation found on the downshear side of the
system (Rogers et al. 2003) and/or influences of the sig-
nificant  topographical  features  (and  possible
downslope drying) on the tropical cyclone.

INSTRUMENTAL  OBSERVATIONS. The
weather journal kept by the U.S. Army hospital stew-
ard, James Mulholland, at New San Diego, provides
instrumental data and other observations that support
the newspaper accounts. The instrumental observa-
tions are included in Table 2. The rapid fall and subse-
quent rise of the barometer are indicative of a tropical
cyclone. The corrected sea level pressure of 29.36 in.
(994 mb), along with a southeast wind of force 8
(75 mph in the U.S. Army wind-force scale) at 1400 LT
on 2 October, indicate that the hurricane center was
nearly due west (~32.5N, 117.3W) of San Diego. The
continuance of southeast winds until a shift to south-

west on 3 October indicates that the hurricane re-
mained offshore and tracked toward the northwest. A
peripheral pressure of 994 mb from within a tropical
cyclone (but not at the center of lowest pressure) sug-
gests maximum 1-min surface winds of at least 58 kt
from a subtropical latitude pressurewind relationship
(Landsea et al. 2004a). This is consistent with visual
estimates of hurricane-force winds from the observed
at the fort in San Diego. We do not attempt to esti-
mate winds from the gradient pressure because the
needed time resolution of pressure data (at least
hourly) is not available. Figure 2, taken from a sequence
of nine maps (not shown), shows the 1400 LT weather
map for 2 October, depicting the hurricane just off-
shore of San Diego.

Observations obtained from the available U.S. Army
posts and Smithsonian Institution observers in the
western United States allow for a reconstruction of the
synoptic conditions before, during and after the
hurricanes impact along the coast. The second half of
September 1858 featured persistent Santa Ana winds
indicating a ridge of high pressure over the western
United States. This ridge began to weaken and retreat
at the beginning of October. A cold front passed
through the northern parts of California on 1 Octo-
ber. This cold front penetrated as far south as the south-
ern Central Valley. Heavy rains began to fall in the
Fresno and Visalia regions on the night of 12 Octo-
ber. The San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin (14 Oc-
tober 1858) reported flooding in the region that caused
damage to mining interests. The rains did not extend
as far north as the Merced River. The rains did reach
Santa Barbara where it rained from an early hour on

the morning of 2 October
and continued for more
than 24 h [Santa Barbara
Gazette, quoted in the Daily
Alta California (13 October
1858)]. An area of low pres-
sure apparently formed as a
wave on the initial cold front
over Nevada and late on 2
October another low pres-
sure  area  passed  over
northern California (and
probably merged with the
Nevada low the next day).
The lowest pressures of the
month were recorded at
both Sacramento and San
Francisco on the evening of
2 October. By this time, the
remnants of the hurricane
were near Los Angeles and
moving in a north or north-
west direction, indicating
that the shortwave trough
and its associated low pres-
sure center did not penetrate far enough south to en-
gage the hurricane. The continued presence of light
westerly winds at Fort Tejon indicates that the wind
field associated with the hurricane did not reach this
far north, and this is also indicated by the continuing
presence of southeast winds near Los Angeles. The
center most likely moved to the northwest, away from
San Diego, and weakened, passing near Santa Catalina
Island and dissipating. Another possible reason for the
hurricanes turn back to the northwest is that as the
system decayed over cooler water it may have been
steered more by the lower-tropospheric mean flow
and that the upper troughs influence was minimized.
The estimated portion of the track of the hurricane is
indicated in Fig. 2 as best can be reconstructed from
available land observations.

WINDS IMPLIED BY DAMAGE REPORTS. The
damage reports are consistent with a category-1 hur-
ricane (Saffir 1973; Simpson 1974) and F1 and F2 Fujita
scale damage (Fujita 1971). The San Diego tide data
remain unlocated. Damage reports do not explicitly
mention a storm surge (except at San Pedro), although
ships were driven ashore. The complete destruction
of many homes and the blowing down of trees is con-
sistent with F1/F2 damage, indicating winds of 5068 kt.
The wind speed estimate at 1400 LT in the New San
Diego weather record of 75 mph is consistent with the

FIG. 2. Weather map for 1400 LT 2 Oct 1858 when the hurricane was probably
at its nearest approach to San Diego. Because of apparent inconsistent adherence
to the recommended wind force scales by many of the U.S. Army weather
observers, the estimated wind speeds were omitted. The thick dashed line
indicates the likely track of the hurricane with approximately 1200 UTC
positions shown.

press reports in both magnitude and timing. The pe-
riod of high winds, approximately from 1300 to 1700
LT, is unusual for this region and likely to cause de-
struction if building practices were based on an expec-
tation of no such violent winds. The construction ma-
terial of the damaged and destroyed homes is not given.
However, the rine roof of the Kiln House, mentioned
in the Heralds account, suggests a well-constructed
building. Following Boose et al. (2001), we assign F1
damage to the blowing down of trees and F2 damage
to the many homes and buildings that were unroofed
and destroyed. We assume that the more substantial
buildings were only unroofed, and weaker structures
completely destroyed. The F2 damage was probably
done by the higher gusts during the hurricane, accom-
panied with structural weakening due to the 4 h of high
winds. The account of ships being driven ashore, the
visually estimated winds, and structural damages from
winds are all consistent with a category-1 hurricane
impact in San Diego.

Damage was widespread but not quantified into a
dollar amount in the newspaper accounts, though San
Diego  was  a  small  settlement  at  the  time;  the
countywide population in 1860 was only 4325. Today,
the population in San Diego County is over 2.9 mil-
lion. By way of a comparison, the 1939 tropical storm
at Long Beach on 25 September produced $2 million
in damage at that time. Adjusted for inflation, popula-

tion in the region (9.5 million in the 2000 U.S. Census
versus only 2.8 million in 1940) and wealth (Pielke and
Landsea 1998), the 1939 storm would cause roughly
$200 million in damages in 2004.

With the type of destruction observed in 1939 from
a tropical storm, the potential for even greater losses
today in a landfalling hurricane like the 1858 event is
higher because tropical cyclone damage tends to in-
crease exponentially with wind speed. Today, if a cat-
egory-1 hurricane made a direct landfall in either San
Diego or Los Angeles, damage from such a storm
would likely be on the order of a few to several hun-
dred million dollars.

CONCLUSIONS. The only tropical cyclone known
to produce estimated hurricane-force winds on the
California coast affected San Diego on 2 October 1858.
Wind damage was largely confined to coastal areas but
heavy rains were felt inland and produced some flood-
ing. The path of the storm exposed the entire coast-
line from San Diego north to the Long Beach area to
estimated tropical stormforce winds. This path has
more destructive potential than the 1939 tropical
storm that struck a much more limited section of the
coastline.

The wind speeds and pressure data for the 1858
hurricane in San Diego are impressive when compared
with the official records for the city. From 1871 to 2002,
the maximum 1-min wind speed is 49 kt from the
southeast on 29 January 1980. The lowest sea level pres-
sure on record at San Diego is 995 mb, measured in
March 1983. However, these were from wintertime
extratropical storm systems. During the MayNovem-
ber Northeast Pacific hurricane season, the highest
1-min winds ever measured in San Diego were 41 kt
on 25 September 1939 (during the Long Beach tropical
storm) and the lowest pressure was 1000 mb in No-
vember 1919 and September 1927. Thus, having
sustained category-1 hurricane winds (~70 kt) and
994-mb pressure are unprecedented in San Diego. No
evidence exists suggesting comparable or stronger
winds in U.S. Army records dating back to 1849. The
Daily Alta California (14 October 1858) description of
one of the most terrific and violent hurricanes ever
noted might be taken as evidence of another undis-
covered hurricane. However, the memories of persons
are unreliable and extratropical storms may be in-
cluded in this assessment. Also, another newspaper
account did describe the storm as the worst in San Diego
history.

The risk of a hurricane in southern California is now
documented to be real. Smith (1986) doubted the like-
lihood of such an event but mentioned that if it hap-

pened it would require several oceanic and atmospheric
features. The southern California coast south of Point
Conception could conceivably experience a minimal
hurricane if SSTs rose to about 24C in the Pacific from
Baja California west to 120W and north to about 33N
and the hurricane moved onshore fast enough to avoid
weakening. . . . Our analysis suggests two possible sce-
narios. In the first, a mid- to upper-level anticyclone
probably steered the hurricane to the north and north-
west and that the deep trough and embedded cold front
to the north did not penetrate far enough south to carry
it inland. The second involves a greater steering by the
lower-tropospheric mean flow, with minimal impact
by the upper-level trough. In either event, the hurri-
cane drifted to the northwest and filled over the wa-
ters of southern California.

Many years with tropical cyclone remnants reach-
ing the southwest United States are El Nino years
(Kimberlain 1999). During these years SSTs rise along
the western coast of Mexico and the United States, thus,
allowing tropical cyclones heading toward the region
to maintain intensity longer than usual. Corals from
the tropical Pacific indicate that 1858 was a warmer year
than either 1857 or 1859 (Cole et al. 2002), but there is
no firm historical documentation of an El Nino event
that year (Ortleib 2000).

As we completed the first version of this article, the
Atlantic basins first documented tropical storm in the
month of April formed south of Bermuda. As the paper
was being edited for final submission, Brazil was struck
by the first documented South Atlantic hurricane in re-
corded history. These are yet additional reminders that
if we wait long enough, or dig deep enough in archives,
that more surprises are in store to challenge our assump-
tions about the frequency, seasonality, and location of
tropical cyclones. The implication of this current work is
that a hurricane has directly impacted southern Califor-
nia in recorded history and, under the right circum-
stances, will again hit the region. One recent system had
the potential to duplicate the track and impact of the 1858
hurricane. Hurricane Linda of 1997, during a strong
El Nino event was forecast by the National Hurricane
Center for a couple of advisories to make landfall near
San Diego as a minimal hurricane or strong tropical
storm (Lawrence 1999). Fortunately, this storm weak-
ened and turned back to the open Pacific Ocean without
impacting land. Residents, business owners, the insur-
ance industry, local emergency managers and decision
makers and Federal Emergency Management Associa-
tion (FEMA) should take note of the meteorological cu-
riosity of the 1858 San Diego hurricane and not be sur-
prised when such an event occurs again to threaten lives
and causes hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
