Basic Concepts of Graphs

1.1

Graph and Graphical Representation

Graph: Mathematically, a graph is a mathematical structure on a set of
elements with a binary relation. Concretely speaking, a graph is an ordered triple
(V, E, ψ), where V and E are two disjoint sets, ψ is a mapping from E → V × V .

Vertex-set: The set V is nonempty and called the vertex-set of the graph,
an element in V called a vertex.

Edge-set: The set E is called the edge-set of the graph, an element in E
called an edge.

Incidence function: The mapping ψ is called an incidence function,
which maps an edge into a pair of vertices called end-vertices of the edge.

Digraph: If V × V is considered as a set of ordered pairs (x, y), then the
graph is called a directed graph, or digraph for short. For an edge e of a digraph,
sometimes, called a directed edge or arc, if ψ(e) = (x, y), then the end-vertices x
and y are called the tail and the head of the edge e, respectively; and the edge e is
sometimes called an out-going edge of x or an in-coming edge of y.

Undirected Graph: If V × V is considered as a set of unordered pairs
{x, y}, then the graph is called an undirected graph. Usually, it is customary to
henceforth denote an unordered pair of vertices by either xy or yx instead of {x, y}.
Edges of an undirected graph are sometimes called undirected edges.

Type of Edges: From definition, it is possible that two end-vertices of an
edge are identical, such an edge is called a loop. It is also possible that more
than one edges are mapped into the same element in V × V under the mapping
ψ, these edges are called parallel edges or multi-edges. For x, y ∈ V (G), set

2

Basic Concepts of Graphs

EG (x, y) = {e ∈ E(G) : ψ(e) = (x, y)} and µG (x, y) = |E(x, y)|. The parameter
µ(G) = max{µG (x, y) : ∀ x, y ∈ V (G)} is called the multiplicity of G.

Example 1.1.1 D = (V (D), E(D), ψD ) is a digraph, where
V (D) = {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 },
E(D) = {a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , a6 , a7 , a8 , a9 }
and ψD is defined by
ψD (a1 ) = (x1 , x2 ),
ψD (a4 ) = (x4 , x3 ),
ψD (a7 ) = (x5 , x2 ),

ψD (a2 ) = (x3 , x2 ),
ψD (a5 ) = (x4 , x2 ),
ψD (a8 ) = (x2 , x5 ),

ψD (a3 ) = (x3 , x3 ),
ψD (a6 ) = (x4 , x2 ),
ψD (a9 ) = (x3 , x5 ).

In such a digraph D, two edges a5 and a6 are parallel edges, but two edges a7
and a8 are not. The edge a3 is a loop.

Example 1.1.2 H = (V (H), E(H), ψH ) is a digraph, where
V (H) = {y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 , y5 }
E(H) = {b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , b5 , b6 , b7 , b8 , b9 }
and ψH is defined by
ψH (b1 ) = (y1 , y2 ),
ψH (b4 ) = (y4 , y3 ),
ψH (b7 ) = (y5 , y2 ),

ψH (b2 ) = (y3 , y2 ),
ψH (b5 ) = (y4 , y2 ),
ψH (b8 ) = (y2 , y5 ),

ψH (b3 ) = (y3 , y3 ),
ψH (b6 ) = (y4 , y2 ),
ψH (b9 ) = (y3 , y5 ).

Example 1.1.3 G = (V (G), E(G), ψG ) is an undirected graph, where
V (G) = {z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 , z5 , z6 }
E(G) = {e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 , e5 , e6 , e7 , e8 , e9 }
and ψG is defined by
ψG (e1 ) = z1 z2 ,
ψG (e4 ) = z2 z3 ,
ψG (e7 ) = z2 z5 ,

ψD (e2 ) = z1 z4 ,
ψG (e5 ) = z3 z4 ,
ψG (e8 ) = z4 z5 ,

ψG (e3 ) = z1 z6 ,
ψG (e6 ) = z3 z6 ,
ψG (e9 ) = z5 z6 .

Two graphical representations of the digraph D

Graphical Representation A graph can be drawn on the plane. Each
vertex x of the graph is indicated by a point, each edge is indicated by a directed
line segment or an undirected line segment. Such a geometric diagram is called
a graphical representation of the graph. It depicts the incidence relationship
holding between its vertices and edges intuitively.

Graphical representations of graphs H and G

Incident and Adjacent: The end-vertices of an edge are said to be incident with the edge, and vice versa. Two vertices which are incident with a common
edge are adjacent, as are two edges which are incident with a common vertex.

Simple Graphs: A graph is said to be loopless if it contains no loops.
A graph is said to be simple if it contains neither parallel edges nor loops. For a
graph without parallel edges, the mapping ψ is injective. In other words, for each
edge e there exists a unique pair of vertices corresponding to the edge. Thus it is
convenience to use a subset of V × V instead of the edge-set E directly. In this
case, we may simply write (V, E) for (V, E, ψ). For instance, the graph G defined
in Example 1.1.3 is simple, which can be written as G = (V (G), E(G)), where
E(G) = {z1 z2 , z1 z4 , z1 z6 , z2 z3 , z3 z4 , z3 z6 , z2 z5 , z4 z5 , z5 z6 }.

The symmetric digraph and oriented graph of an undirected graph

Symmetric Digraphs: An undirected graph can be thought of as a particular digraph, a symmetric digraph, in which there are two directed edges called
symmetric edges, one in each direction, corresponding to each undirected edge.
Thus, to study structural properties of graphs for digraphs is more general than for
undirected graphs.

Underlying Graphs and Oriented Graph: There are many topics

4

Basic Concepts of Graphs

in graph theory that have no relations with direction of edges. The undirected
graph obtained from a digraph D by removing the orientation of all edges is called
an underlying graph of D. Conversely, the digraph obtained from an undirected
graph G by specifying an orientation of each edge of G is called an oriented graph
of G.
Figure 1.3 shows such graphs, where (a) is an undirected graph, (b) and (c) are
its symmetric digraph and an oriented graph, respectively.

Others: Let (V, E, ψ) be a graph. The number of vertices, υ = |V |, is called
order of the graph; the number of edges, ε = |E|, is called size of the graph. A
graph is called to be empty if ε = 0. An empty graph is called to be trivial if
υ = 1, and all other graphs non-trivial. A graph is finite if both υ and ε are finite.
Throughout this book all graphs are always considered to be finite.
The letter G always denotes a graph, which is directed or undirected according
to the context if it is not specially noted. Sometimes, to emphasize, we use the letter
D to denote a digraph. When just one graph is under discussion, the letters v and
ε always denote order and size of the graph, respectively.
The symbols ⌊r⌋ and ⌈r⌉ denote the greatest integer not exceeding the real number r and the smallest integer not less than r, respectively. The symbol
 
n
n(n − 1) · · · (n − k + 1)
=
k
k!
denotes the number of k-combinations of n distinct objects (k ≤ n).
As an application of a graph, we give an example.

Example 1.1.4 In any group of six people, there must be three people who
get to either know each other or not.
Proof: We use the points A, B, C, D, E, F on the plane to denote these six
people, respectively. We draw a red line joining two points if two people have known
each other, a blue line otherwise. Use G to denote the resulting diagram. We only
need to prove that G certainly contains either a red triangle or a blue triangle.
Consider a point, say F . There exist three lines of the same color which are incident
with a common point F . Without loss of generality, we can suppose that they are
three red lines F A, F B and F C. Consider the triangle ABC. If it has no red line,
then it is a blue triangle; if it has a red line, say AB, then the triangle F AB is red.

1.2. GRAPH ISOMORPHISM

Graph Isomorphism

Isomorphism: Two graphs often have the same structure, differing only in
the way their vertices and edges are labelled or the way they are drawn on the plane.
To make this idea more exact, we introduce the concept of isomorphism. A graph
G = (V (G), E(G), ψG ) is isomorphic to a graph H = (V (H), E(H), ψH ) if there
exist two bijective mappings
θ : V (G) → V (H) and φ : E(G) → E(H)
such that for any e ∈ E(G),
ψG (e) = (x, y) ⇐⇒ ψH (φ(e)) = (θ(x), θ(y)) ∈ E(H).

(1.1)

The pair (θ, φ) of mappings is called an isomorphic mapping from G to H.
Since such two mappings θ and φ are bijective, H also isomorphic to G. Thus we
often call that G and H are isomorphic, write G ∼
= H, the pair (θ, φ) of mappings
is called an isomorphism between G and H.
To show that two graphs are isomorphic, one must indicate an isomorphism
between them. For instance, two digraphs D and H defined in Example 1.1.1 and
Example 1.1.2, respectively, are isomorphic since the pair of mappings (θ, ψ) is an
isomorphism between them, where θ : V (D) → V (H) and ψ : E(D) → E(H) are
defined by
θ(xi ) = yi , for each i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , 5; and
ψ(aj ) = bj , for each i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , 9.
The concept of isomorphism for simple graphs is simple. Two simple graphs G
and H are isomorphic if and only if there is a bijection θ : V (G) → V (H) such that
(x, y) ∈ E(G) if and only if (θ(x), θ(y)) ∈ E(H). In this case, the condition (1.1) is
usually called the adjacency-preserving condition.
It is clear that if G and H are isomorphic, then υ(G) = υ(H) and ε(G) = ε(H).
But the converse is not always true. Generally speaking, to judge whether or not
two graphs are isomorphic is quite difficult.
It is easy to see that “to be isomorphic” is an equivalent relation on graphs;
hence, this relation divides the collection of all graphs into equivalence classes. Two
graphs in the same equivalence classes have the same structure, and differ only in
the labels of vertices and edges. Since we are primarily interested in structural
properties of graphs, we will identify two isomorphic graphs, and often write G = H

6

Basic Concepts of Graphs

for G ∼
= H. We often omit labels when drawing them on the plane; an unlabelled
graph can be thought of as a representative of the equivalence class of isomorphic
graphs. We assign labels to vertices and edges in a graph mainly for the purpose of
referring to them.

Some Special Classes of Graphs: Next, we introduce some special
classes of graphs, which frequently occur in our discussion later on.

Figure 1.4:

Petersen graph

The graph shown in Figure 1.4 is called Petersen graph, an interesting graph,
which often occurs in the literature and any textbook on graph theory as various
counterexamples.

A complete graph is one in which each ordered pair of distinct vertices is
linked by exactly one edge. Up to isomorphism, there is just one complete graph
on υ vertices, denoted by Kυ . The graphs shown in Figure 1.5 (a) and (b) are a
complete undirected graph K5 and a complete digraph K3 , respectively. It is clear
that
ε(Kv ) =



υ(υ − 1)

2 υ(υ − 1)

if Kυ is directed;
if Kυ is undirected.

An oriented graph of a complete undirected graph is called a tournament. The
reason why we call it the name is that it can be used to indicate the results of games
in a round-robin tournament between υ players. A directed edge (x, y) means that
the player x has won the player y. Up to isomorphism, the tournament of order one
is a trivial graph; there is just one tournament of order two; two tournaments of

7

1.2. GRAPH ISOMORPHISM

order three; four tournaments of order four. These not isomorphic tournaments are
shown in Figure 1.6.

Figure 1.6:

Nonisomorphic tournaments of order υ for υ = 1, 2, 3, 4

A bipartite graph is one whose vertex-set can be partitioned into two subsets
X and Y , so that each edge has one end-vertex in X and another in Y , such a
partition {X, Y } is called a bipartition of the graph. We call a graph to be equally
bipartite if it is bipartite and has a bipartition with the same number of vertices in
each part. We often use the symbol G(X ∪ Y, E) to denote a bipartite simple graph
G = (V, E) with bipartition {X, Y }. Similarly, we can define a k-partite graph
and an equally k-partite graph.
A complete bipartite graph is a bipartite simple graph G(X ∪ Y, E) in which
each vertex of X is joined by exactly one edge to each vertex of Y ; if |X| = m and
|Y | = n, up to isomorphism, such a complete bipartite undirected graph is unique
and denoted by Km, n . The graph shown in Figure 1.5 (c) is K3, 3 . It is customary
to call K1, n a star. Usually, write Kn (2) for Kn, n .
Similarly, we can define complete k-partite graph and Kn (k).
ε(Km, n ) = mn and ε(Kn (k)) =

k(k − 1)n2 .

It is also easy to verify that for any bipartite simple graph G of order n,

if n is even;

ε(G) ≤

if n is odd.

Bipartite graphs are an important class of graphs. In fact, every digraph corresponds a bipartite undirected graph. Let D = (V, E, ψ) be a digraph, where
V (D) = {x1 , x2 , · · · , xv } and E(D) = {a1 , a2 , · · · , aε }.
Construct an equally bipartite undirected graph G = (X ∪ Y, E(G), ψG ) with
X = {x′1 , x′2 , · · · , x′v }, Y = {x′′1 , x′′2 , · · · , x′′v },
E(G) = {e1 , e2 , · · · , eε }, where ψG (el ) = x′i x′′j
⇐⇒ there is al ∈ E(D) such that ψD (al ) = (xi , xj )
(l = 1, 2, · · · , ε).

8

Basic Concepts of Graphs

Such a constructed bipartite undirected graph G is called an associated bipartite
graph with the digraph D. For instance, the graph G shown in Figure 1.7 (b) is an
associated bipartite graph with the digraph D shown in (a). It is clear that
υ(G) = 2 υ(D) and ε(G) = ε(D).

A digraph D and its associated bipartite graph G

Example 1.2.1 We construct an equally bipartite simple graph, called ncube, or hypercube, denoted by Qn = (V (Qn ), E(Qn )), where
V (Qn ) = {x1 x2 · · · xn : xi ∈ {0, 1}, i = 1, 2, · · · , n},
and two vertices x = x1 x2 · · · xn and y = y1 y2 · · · yn are linked by an undirected
edge if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate, i.e.,
xy ∈ E(Qn ) ⇐⇒

n
X
i=1

|xi − yi | = 1.

The graphs shown in Figure 1.8 are Q1 , Q2 , Q3 and Q4 .
By definition, Qn is a simple undirected graph, and has 2n vertices. We show
that Qn is bipartite. To the end, let
X = {x1 x2 · · · xn : x1 + x2 + · · · + xn ≡ 0 (mod 2)};
Y = {y1 y2 · · · yn : y1 + y2 + · · · + yn ≡ 1 (mod 2)}.
Then, by definition, X ∪ Y = V (Qn ), X ∩ Y = ∅. Therefore, {X, Y } is a
bipartition of V (Qn ). We can claim that there is no edge between any two vertices
in X. Suppose to the contrary that there exist x = x1 x2 · · · xn , x′ = x′1 x′2 · · · x′n ∈ X
n
P
such that xx′ ∈ E(Qn ). Then
|xi − x′i | = 1, namely,
i=1

|(x1 + x2 + · · · + xn ) − (x′1 + x′2 + · · · + x′n )| = 1.

This contradicts the fact that x and x′ are in X. There, therefore, is no edge between
any two vertices in X.
Similarly, there is no edge between any two vertices in Y . Therefore, Qn is a
bipartite graph with the bipartition {X, Y }.

Arbitrarily choose x = x1 x2 · · · xn ∈ V (Qn ). For a vertex y = y1 y2 · · · yn of Qn ,
it is adjacent to x if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. This means
that vertices adjacent to the vertex x have exactly n, that is, edges incident with
x have n since Qn is simple. Let us use EX (resp. EY ) to denote the set of edges
incident with vertices in X (resp. Y ). Then
n|X| = |EX | = ε(Qn ) = |EY | = n|Y |,
|X| = |Y | = 12 υ(Qn ) = 2n−1 and
ε(Qn ) = n2n−1 .
