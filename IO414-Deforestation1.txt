Deforestation used to be something that few people apart from environmentalists 

talked about, but in the last 20 years or so it has received increasing (1)___________ 

from governments and the media, and is now generally considered one of the worlds 

most serious environmental problems.  

There is (2)___________ about how much forest has been disappearing, but few 

people doubt there is much less forest now than there was, say, fifty years ago. 

Deforestation leads to the extinction of many (3)___________of forest animals and 

the erosion of soil after trees have been removed, but the (4)___________of 

deforestation that we hear most about is its contribution to global warming. Trees 

naturally absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Earths atmosphere, so 

(5)___________ trees means higher levels of CO2, which contributes to the 

atmosphere becoming warmer. Many scientists estimate that about 20% of global 

warming is due to (6)___________.  

Deforestation is taking place mostly in developing countries in tropical regions of 

South and Southeast Asia, Central and South (7)___________, and Africa. Perhaps 

the most well-known case is the (8)___________ size of the huge Amazon rainforest 

in northern Brazil. 

Many people around the world say these developing countries should do more to 

(9)___________ their forests  although the developing countries could point out that 

most of the worlds developed countries destroyed most of their own forests many 

centuries (10)___________. 

In some cases deforestation is caused by poor people who want to use the wood for 

fuel or to clear a small amount of land in order to grow (11)___________ for their 

families. In many cases, however, it happens because there are large profits to be 

made  for example from selling the wood, or from growing crops (such as soybeans) 

or raising animals (such as cattle, for beef) on the land after the trees have gone. 

Produce from (12)___________ land is often exported, so there is often a link 

between what people choose to buy in their local shops and what happens to forests in 

countries thousands of miles (13)___________. 

Deforestation will be among the subjects discussed at the very important United 

Nations climate change summit taking (14)___________ in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 

December this year, when hopefully developed and developing countries will be able 

to come to an agreement about ways to (15)___________ down global warming.

Deforestation used to be something that few people apart from environmentals talked 

about, but in the last 20 years and so it has received increasing attention from 

governments and the midia, and is now generally considered one of the worlds most 

serious environmental problems.  

There is disagreement about how much forest has disappearing, but few people doubt 

there is much less forest now than there was, say, fifty years ago. 

Deforestation leads to the extinct of many species of forest animals and the erosion of 

soil after trees have been removed, but the consequence of deforestation that we hear 

most about is its contribution to global warming. Trees naturally absorb carbon 

dioxide (CO2) from the Earths atmosfere, so fewer trees means higher levels of CO2, 

which contributes to the atmosphere becoming warmer. Many scientists estimate that 

about 20% of global warming is dew to deforestation.  

Deforestation is taking place mostly in developing countries in tropical regions of 

South and Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and Africa. Perhaps the more 

well-known case is the decreasing size of the huge Amazon rainforest in northern 

Brazil. 

Many people around the world say this developing countries should do more to 

protect their forests  although the developing countries could point that most of the 

worlds developed countries stroyed most of their own forests many centuries ago. 

In some cases deforestation is cause by poor people who want to use the wood for fuel 

or to clear a small amount of land in orders to grow food for their families. In many 

cases, however, it happens because there are large profits to be done  for example 

from selling the wood, or from growing crops (such as soybeans) or railing animals 

(such as cattle, for beef) on the land after the trees have gone. Produce from 

deforested land is often exported, so there is often a lank between what people choose 

to buy in their local shops and what happens forests in countries thousands of miles 

away. 

Deforestation will be among the subjects discuss at the very important United Nations 

climate change sum taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December this year, 

when hopefully developed and developing countries will be able to come to an 

agreement about ways to slow down global warming.
