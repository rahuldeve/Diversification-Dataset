Power in Networks
By Valdis Krebs

They say the golden rule in Real Estate is: Location,
Location, Location. Might this rule also hold in social
networks? In real estate, location is determined by
geography – your physical location. In social networks,
location is determined by your connections and the
connections of those around you – your virtual location.
Two social network measures, Betweenness and Closeness,
are particularly revealing of a node’s advantageous or
constrained location in a network. The values of both
metrics are dependent upon the pattern of connections that
a node is embedded in. Betweenness measures the control a
node has over what flows in the network – how often is this
node on the path between other nodes? Closeness
measures how easily a node can access what is available
via the network – how quickly can this node reach all
others in the network? A combination where a node has
easy access to others, while controlling the access of other
nodes in the network, reveals high informal power.
We will look at a simple human network and watch how
power changes in the network based on connections made
and lost in the network over time.

Below are two groups – A and B, each organized as a hierarchy. A node represents a person
in each group. A grey line indicates the prescribed structure of the organization – the formal
network or hierarchy. All information and resources flow through each group’s leader –
nodes 010 and 015. Measuring each node’s Power, our InFlow™ software reveals the
obvious. Each leader is in complete control of their group – they each have a perfect Power
score of 1.00. We see two equivalent groups – same size, same structure.

Group A : Power

Scenario One
The leaders decide to form a tie between themselves for possible collaboration, or exploitation.
By creating this informal tie [purple line], each leader can now monitor the other group. Each
leader remains dominant over their respective group and neither leader loses power relative to
the other – they have equal power scores. Yet, both leaders have lost some power by joining
their groups! Before they had total dominance over the group they ruled. Now they share equal
dominance over a larger group. Collaboration can reduce individual dominance. Notice that
everyone’s power decreases! Information flow is less constrained and therefore everyone has
less control over it.

Unbeknownst to the leaders another connection emerges between their groups. Person 016 of
Group B befriends person 014 of Group A. Soon information is flowing along this link also.

This new link, between formerly separate groups, increases the power for both nodes that create
this bridge – though ever so slightly. Also, the leaders’ grasp on power is reduced – at a
similarly imperceptible rate. The change is not noticed other than by 014 and 016.

Person 014 having learned to trust 016 decides to introduce the new friend to the leader of Group
A. Node 015 is currently unaware of this new connection. Person 016 now has more links to the
other group than to their home group.

Naturally person 016’s power increases, while their leader’s[015] power inches lower. Leader
010’s power increase because there are now two paths to Group B. Being connected to the
powerful also increases a node’s power. Nodes 011, 012, and 013 benefit from leader 010’s
increase in power.

follow the law of increasing returns – the rich get richer. People who are well connected attract

new ties from others hoping to take advantage of the many connections. 016’s colleagues [017,
018, 019] soon form a tie with the emergent boundary spanner[016].

These three new connections, low in the hierarchy, really change the playing field. The power
gap between the two formal leaders is now wide and obvious to everyone involved. 015’s wellconnected subordinate[016] now has as much informal power as the boss ! 015 and 016 are
structurally equivalent in the network – they both have the same ties. A power struggle may be
inevitable.
Person 016 lets the tie to node 014 atrophy or weaken – it is no longer critical. One can only
maintain a small number of active strong ties.

Node 015 finally senses the loss of power. In frustration, 015 cuts the tie to the other formal
leader 010, resulting in even more power to node 016! While clinging to formal authority, leader
015 starts making plans to remove 016 from the group. Will this succeed?

The power metrics reveal a typical picture – it is rare to have more than one powerful leader.
Leader 010 now has both formal and informal power.

The new connections change the shape of the organization. This is the emergent structure of
these two connected groups based on both formal[grey] and informal[purple] connections.
.

This visualization of the emergent structure of the network reveals something interesting, and
counter-intuitive, about networks. Both nodes 010 and 016 have the same pattern of, and the
same number of, connections. Yet, node 010 has more power! Why? Node 010 is wisely taking
advantage of structural holes in the network. A structural hole is anywhere in the network where
two nodes could be connected, but are not. There are structural holes between any combination
of nodes 011, 012, 013, and 014. This leaves node 010 in a position of total control over the
local cluster. A hub[010] controls all spokes[011,012,013,014] attached to it – like the formal
hierarchy we saw in the first diagram.
In the other cluster, node 016 is connected to nodes who are somewhat interconnected. There are
a few holes in 016’s cluster[can you spot them?], but not as many as in 010’s cluster. The
network in 016’s cluster does not provide such control because there are several alternate paths
of flow and exchange. Node 15’ s connections in the cluster provide an alternative to
dependence on node 016. The nodes in 010’s cluster currently have no such choice of where to
send and receive information. They are totally dependent on Node 010. Where would you add 3
new links to have the maximum effect of lowering 010’s dominance?

Scenario Two
Instead of connecting to the other group, suppose Node 016 made new connections within the
group? The emergent group structure may look like this.

Group B : Power

Notice that 015 and 016 become structurally equivalent immediately – they have the same ties.
The nodes connected to them increase their power scores because their information flow in no
longer constrained by flowing just through one node. If the rest of the nodes in 015’s group
connect to each other, we have a further dilution of 015’s power over the group. In fact, we have
an equal distribution of power across the whole group! When everyone is connected to everyone
else, no one stands out. This is reflected in everyone having an identical power score of 0.500.

Soon Node 016 from Group B spans a boundary and connects to Node 014 from Group A.
Before long the behavior in Group B[all subordinates interconnected] spreads to Group A. This
removes non-hierarchical power from the formal leaders[010 and 015] of both groups and
transfers it to the boundary spanners [014, 016].

One strategy for the group leaders to gain informal power would be to become a boundary
spanners themselves. This not only increases their power rankings but also increases the
rankings for the whole group. The advantage to the whole group increases as more bridges are
created. Yet, as more bridges are built, the individual advantage of being part of a bridge begins
to diminish.

A centralized network, such as a hierarchy or a hub-and-spoke, has centralized power. These
networks have a few nodes with many connections, while also containing many nodes with only
a few connections. As the disconnected start to connect, power becomes more distributed.
