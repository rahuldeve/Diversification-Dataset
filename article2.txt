ABSTRACT  

 
This study investigates the impact of information security breaches on firm performance.  Unlike previous studies that 
used  an  event  study  methodology,  we  used  a  matched-sample  comparison  analysis  to  investigate  the  impact  of  security 
breaches  on  firm  performance.    To  investigate  this  impact,  we  considered  subsequent  four  quarters  following  the  security 
breach  and  determine  if  the  breached  firms  performance  decreased  compared  to  that  of  the  peer  firms  (control  group).  
Although the breached firms sales and operating income did not decrease in the subsequent quarters following the breach, 
return  on  assets  decreased  in  the  third  quarter.    Also,  performance  of  the  control  firms  was  higher  compared  to  that  of  the 
treatment firms in general.  However, the breached firms sales increased significantly in the fourth quarter compared to those 
of the control firms.

INTRODUCTION 

As  the  number  of  organizations  that  conduct  their 
businesses electronically grows continuously, information 
security becomes one of major concerns for top managers.  
According  to  a  recent  survey  by  Forrester,  out  of  410  IT 
decision  makers,  about  75  percent  reported  that  IT 
security has become critical to their business planning and 
over  80  percent  reported  that  they  are  concerned  about 
financial  losses  from  it  [20]  .    In  another  survey  taken 
from  risk  managers  of  the  U.S  and  European  companies, 

computer  risk  was  ranked  as  the  top  concern  among 
European companies and the number two concern among 
U.S. companies [14].   

Information  security  incidents  are  also  continuously 
rising.  According  to  the  2005  computer  crime  and 
security  survey  by  CSI/FBI,  95  percent  of  respondents 
reported that their organization experienced more than 10 
Web cite incidents in 2005 compared to only 5 percent of 
respondents  in  2004  [11,12].    The  same  survey  also 
reported  that  the  average  loss  per  incident  from  the 
unauthorized  access  to  information  has  increased  to

$300K  from  51K  and  loss  from  the  theft  of  proprietary 
information  has  also  increased  to  $356K  from  $169K 
since 2004.   Thus, a security breach incident could result 
in tremendous financial losses to organizations [8, 22].    

Employing  an  event  study  methodology,  a  few 
previous  studies  have  investigated  the  market  reaction  of 
information security breaches announced publicly [5, 6, 9, 
10, 14, 15].  The event study methodology is based on the 
assumption  that  capital  markets  are  efficient  to  evaluate 
the impact of the events on expected future cash flows of 
the  firms  [7].  Overall,  these  previous  studies  found  that 
the  market  discriminates  breached  companies  in  the  first 
few  days  following  the  public  announcement  of  the 
breach.    However,  no  previous  studies  have  investigated 
the  impact  of  security  breaches  on  long-term  financial 
performance.   

This  study  investigates  the  impact  of  information 
security  breaches  on  the  breached  companies  financial 
performance in the subsequent four quarters following the 
public  announcement  of  the  security  breach  incidents.  
Our  sample  includes  only  one  type  of  security  breach, 
unauthorized access to confidential data.  Campbell et al 
[5] found a significant negative market reaction when the 
breaches  are  related  to  confidential  data.    However,  the 
same  study  indicated  that  the  market  did  not  react 
differently

Considering this result, we only included incidents related 
to unauthorized access to confidential data in our sample.

[12].    Although  these  security  incidents  are  continuously 
rising  and  organizations  have  come 
the 
importance  of  information  security,  assessing  the  impact 
of  security  breaches  is  very  difficult  because  costs  of 
security breaches are not ease to quantify [18].   

to  aware 

  While  there  are  many  news  and  surveys  that  have 
reported  the  magnitude  of  the  monetary  losses  from  the 
breached incidents, there have been only a few academic 
studies  that  have  investigated  empirically  on  this  issue.  
All  of  these  previous  studies  used  an  event  study 
methodology  and  their  results  are  summarized  in  the 
following. 

 
Campbell  et  al.  [5]  investigated  the  stock  market 
reaction of information security breaches on public firms. 
The authors concluded that the economic consequence of 
a  security  breach  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  breach.  
They  found  a  highly  significant  negative  market  reaction 
when  breaches  are  related  to  unauthorized  access  to 
confidential data.   However, the authors did not find any 
significant  market  reaction  for  other  types  of  security 
breaches.   

 
Garg  et  al.  [9]  estimated  that  security  incidents  can 
cost breached companies 0.5 to 1 percent of annual sales 
on  average.  The  authors  also  tested  for  the  spillover 
effects  on  security  vendors  and  insurance  carriers  and 
found  that  security  vendors  experienced  a  share  price 
increase  between  1  to  3  percent  and  insurance  carriers 
experienced  1  to  2  percent  increase  in  a  share  price  as  a 
result of security breach. 

 
Similar to the study by Garg  et al. [9], Cavusoglu et 
al.  [6]  found  that  the  security  breach  announcements 
affect  the  value  of  breached  firms  and  also  of  Internet 
security developers.  On average, the breached  firms lost 
2.1  percent  of  their  market  value  within  two  days 
following  the  public  announcement.    On  the  other  hand, 
the  security  developers  realized  an  average  abnormal 
return of 1.36 percent during this period.    

 
Hovav  and  DArcy  [14]  investigated  the  impact  of 
denial-of-service  (DOS)  attacks  by  examining  the  stock 
market  reaction.    They  found  no  significant  impact  of 
DOS attacks on the capital market.  However, their results 
indicated  that  a  significant  negative  financial  impact  on 
Internet-specific  companies.    Hovav  and  DArcy  [15] 
examined the impact of virus attack announcements.  The 
authors  found no  negative abnormal return over any of 5 
days  following  the  event.    However,  they  found  almost 
half  of  the  firms  experienced  negative  abnormal  returns 
25 days after the announcement. 

 
Based  on  the  review  of  previous  studies,  security 
breach  incidents  do  have  significant  impact  on  the 
breached companies or other related companies.  So, what 
are  the  costs  that  should  be  considered?    The  costs  of 
security breaches can be classified as short-term costs and 
long-term  costs.    Examples  of  short-term  costs  include 
cost  of  repairs,  cost  of  replacement  of  the  system,  lost

business due to the disruption of business operations, and 
lost productivity of employees. These are also considered 
tangible costs.  On the other hand, long-term costs include 
the loss of existing customers due to loss of trust, failing 
to  attract  potential  future  customers  due  to  negative 
reputation  from  the  breach,  loss  of  business  partners  due 
to  loss  of  trust,  and  potential  legal  liabilities  from  the 
breach  [6,  21].    Most  of  these  costs  are  intangible  costs 
that  are  difficult  to  calculate  but  extremely  important  in 
assessing 
the 
organization [6].    

the  overall  security  breach  costs 

to 

 
The  breached  firms  incur  tangible  and  intangible 
costs.    Thus,  we  argue  that  financial  performance  of  a 
breached  firm  decreases  compared  to  its  performance 
before the breach.  In addition, financial performance of a 
breached firm is poor when it is compared to a peer firm 
that  is  in  the  same  industry  and  similar  in  size  and  also 
has  not  experienced  any  security  breach.    Thus,  the 
following hypotheses are proposed. 

H1:   The  security  breach  incident  will  result  in 
decreased  performance  of  security  breached 
firm in the long-term. 

H2:  The 

financial  performance  of 

security 
breached  firms  will  be  significantly  lower  in 
the  long-term  than  that  of  the  other  firms  that 
have not experienced the security breach.   

 

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

 
To evaluate the financial impact of security breaches 
related  to  confidential  information,  the  matched  sample 
comparison group method is used. This methodology has 
also  been  used  in  other  previous  studies  [1,4,16].  Our 
sample  includes  two  groups,  the  treatment  and  control 
samples.  The treatment sample represents firms that have 
experienced information security breaches and the control 
sample  represents  firms  that  were  selected  to  match  the 
treatment sample by size and industry.   

Sample Selection 
To select firms that have security breaches related to 
 
confidential  data,  we  obtained  data  on  security  breached 

 
 
 
 
 

firms  from  previous  studies  [5,  9].    These  two  studies 
included  detailed  information  about  all  security  breached 
firms for the period from 1997 to 2001.  From these two 
sources,  we  identified  16  cases  related  to  unauthorized 
access to confidential data and only 12 cases are included 
in our sample due to lack of financial data available from 
Compustat.    To  include  more  current  data,  we  identified 
additional  breached  firms  for  the  period  from  2002  to 
2003  from  three  sources  -  Lexis/Nexis,  CNET,  and 
ZDNET.    The  key  words  attack,  breach,  break-in, 
hacker,  Internet,  and  security  were  used.    This 
approach  was  used  in  Cavusoglu  et  al.  [6].    When 
breached incidents were limited to confidential data, only 
7 cases were left.  As a result, the final treatment sample 
includes 19 cases.    

 
To  control  for  confounding  changes  in  industry  and 
the firm size, we followed some steps to select a matching 
control  firm  that  is  comparable  to  the  treatment  sample.  
Initially, firms from the same primary four-digit SIC code 
as the treatment firm were pulled from Compustat as a list 
of  potential  control  firms.    From  each  list,  we  chose  the 
firm  that  had  reported  three  different  size  measures 
closest  to  the  amounts  reported  by  the  corresponding 
treatment firm.  In this study, we used annual total assets, 
annual  sales,  and  number  of  employees  as  the  size 
measures,  which  are  commonly  used  as  proxies  for  the 
firm  size.    To  match  the  size,  we  allowed  the  size 
measures  of  a  potential  control  firm  to  be  between  70% 
and  130%  of  the  treatment  firms  values.  When  no 
comparable  firms  were  available  in  their  four-digit  SIC 
code,  we  tried  to  match  using  three-digit  SIC  codes,  and 
then  two-digit  SIC  codes.    Other  previous  studies  used 
this  method  for  selecting  matching  control  sample  from 
the  same  industry  and  similar  in  size  as  the  treatment 
sample [1, 2, 4].  

To determine if there were any significant differences 
 
between  the  two  different  sample  groups,  a  t-test  and  a 
non-parametric  test  were  carried  out  comparing  total  of 
assets,  number  of  employees,  and  annual  sales.  No 
significant  differences  were  found  between  the  sample 
groups.   Descriptive statistics about the characteristics of 
firms  in  the  treatment  and  control  samples  and  results  of 
tests are shown in Table 1.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

MEASURES 

  We used accounting measures to evaluate the impact 
of  security  breach  incidents.    The  use  of  accounting 
measures of performance is the most popular approach to 
measure  firm  performance  [3].    Accounting  measures 
commonly rely on ratio analysis. 

  We  used  four  profit  based  ratios  (ROA,  ROS,  OI/A, 
OI/S, and two cost related ratios (COGS/S and TOE/S) to 
measure  firm  performance.  In  addition,  we  included 
percentage of change in sales and operating income to see 
if  these  measures  are  better  indicators  for  identifying 
differences in performance considering the context of this 
study.  Profit ratios have been the most commonly used as 
performance  measures  [4,  13,  16].    Descriptions  of  the 
financial performance measures are shown in Table 2.

Quarterly financial performance data were collected from 
Compustat for both the treatment and the control samples.  
Performance was considered as two time periods  before 
the  security  incident  and  after  the  security  incident.  
Therefore,  for  each  treatment  sample,  the  performance 
measures  were  collected  for  four  quarters  before  the 
incident  and  four  quarters  after  the  incident.    For  each 
corresponding  control  firm,  performance  measures  were 
collected for applicable quarters included in the treatment 
firm.  

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

  We  examined  the  normality  plots  to  check  the 
underlying  distributions  of  the  variables.    The  data  are 
close  to  normal  with  the  exception  of  outliers  in  all 
variables.  Due to the possible influential effects of these 

outliers  using  parametric

tests,  we  conducted  non-

 
To test H1, performance measures in the time period 
t+1 to t+4 are matched against performance measures in the 
corresponding  time  period  t-1  to  t-4  and  calculated  the 
relative  changes  in  performance  measures  over  four 
quarters.    This  indicates  the  percentage  of  change  in 
performance  (for  sales  and  operating  income)  or  the 
difference  in  performance  (for  all  ratios)  of  each  quarter 
after the incident when it compared to the performance of 
the  corresponding  quarter  before  the  incident  for  each 
firm  (e.g.,  %  difference  in  sales  in  t+1    %  difference  in 
sales  in  t-1).    This  is  referred  to  as  the  within  firm 
differences in our analysis.   

 
To  test  within  firm  differences,  we  used  the 
Wilcoxon  signed  rank  test,  which  is  a  paired  non-
parametric  test  since  we  are  comparing  two  values  for

each firm before and after the incident.  This test is much 
less  sensitive  to  outliers  and  it  tests  whether  the  average 
of the differences differs from zero. This test is adequate 
when  comparing  before-and-after  observations  on  the 
same subjects [19].  

To test H2, performance measures in the time period 
 
t+1  to  t+4  of  the  treatment  firm  are  matched  against 
performance measures in the corresponding time period t-1 
to  t-4  and  calculated  the  relative  changes  in  performance 
measures of the treatment  firms over  four quarters.  This 
same  procedure  is  repeated  for  the  control  firms.    The 
differences  of  the  treatment  and  control  firms  for  these 

relative  changes  in  measures  are  then  calculated  by 
subtracting the performance measures of the control firms 
from  the  treatment  firms  performance  measures.    This 
indicates  the  percentage  of  change  in  performance  (for 
sales and operating income) or difference in performance 
(for all ratios) between treatment firms and control firms.  
This  is  referred  to  as  the  between  firm  differences  in 
our  analysis.    For  this  analysis,  we  used  an  independent 
Mann-Whitney 
test  since  we  are  comparing  mean 
difference for the two samples  the treatment and control 
firms  [17].    Table  3  describes  the  calculated  average 
differences in performance as described above.

RESULTS 

Within Firm Differences  
 
Table  4  summarized  the  results  of  the  within  firm 
differences  analysis.    The  within  treatment  firms 
differences  between  subsequent  quarters  following  the 
incident and quarters before the incident were as follows.  
First,  the  percentage  change  in  sales  (S  in  table  4)  was 
significant  except  for  the  first  quarter  following  the 
breach.    The  percentage  change  in  operating  income  (OI 
in  table  4)  was  significant  in  the  second  and  third 
quarters.    The  difference  in  ROA  was  significant  in  the 
third quarter.  The difference in operating income to sales 
 

(OI/S  in  table  4)  was  significant  in  the  second  quarter.  
The difference in total operating expenses to sales (TOE/S 
in  table  4)  was  significant  in  the  first  two  quarters.  
Overall,  the  treatment  firms  performance  after  the 
security incidents did not decrease in subsequent quarters 
following  the  breach  except  for  ROA.    Return  on  Assets 
has  decreased  in  the  subsequent  quarter  (quarter  3) 
compared to the quarter before the incident.  In the case of 
TOE/S, although a sign of  Z  value  is  negative, it reflects 
the increase in performance since it represents either total 
expenses  have  decreased  or  sales  have  increased.    Based 
on our analysis, H1 cannot be rejected.

IMPACT OF SECURITY BREACHES ON FIRM PERFORMANCE 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

Between Firm Differences 
Table 5 summarized the results of the between firm 
 
differences  analysis. 
  The  differences  of  financial 
performance  between  the  treatment  and  control  firms 
were  as  follows.    First,  in  the  first  quarter,  the  treatment 
firms performance measures were lower for all except for 

COGS/S compared to the control firms measures but the 
differences  were  not  statistically  significant.    Second,  in 
the second and third quarters, the control firms ROA was 
significant  and  positive,  which  indicates  higher  profit 
margin generated for each dollar in assets.   Third, in the 
third  quarter,  the  control  firms  ROS  was  significant  and 
positive.  Fourth, the treatment firms sales are significant 
and positive in the fourth quarter.

To  show 

the  differences 

the  magnitude  of 

 
in 
performance between treatment and control firms, Table 6 
was  created.    From  the  results  of  the  within  firm 
differences analysis in Table 4, only those variables that 
had  significant  differences  are  included  by  performance 
measure  and  by  quarter.    Then,  median  value  for  each 
significant  performance  variables  was  pulled  from  Table 
3  and  compared  the  magnitude  of  the  difference  in 
median  value.    The  last  column  identifies  the  sample 
group that has the higher positive significant difference in 
performance.   

the  sample  group 

For  those  variables  that  were  identified  as  not 
 
significant, 
that  has  significant 
differences  was  selected  in  the  last  column.    For  others, 
we  compared  the  magnitude  of  the  difference  in  median 
value  and  determine  which  sample  group  has  the  higher 
positive  significant  difference  in  performance.  As  shown 
in Table 6, 15 out of 19 values indicated that control firms 
had higher performance.  There is one value that shows a 
significant negative difference (ROA in third quarter).  

From this comparison table, some interesting findings 
 
are  as  follows. 
  First,  control  firms  had  higher 
performance  in  sales  for  the  second  and  third  quarter 
compared  to  that  of  the  treatment  firms.    However,  the 
treatment  firms  had  higher  performance  in  sales  in  the 
fourth  quarter.  Second,  control 
firms  had  higher 
performance in operating income for two quarters.  Third, 
control  firms  had  a  significant  improvement  in  ROA  in 
the second quarter while treatment firms had a significant 
decrease  in  ROA  in  the  third  quarter.  Fourth,  control 
firms  outperformed 
in  ROS,  OI/S, 
COG/S, and TOE/S. 

treatment  firms 

 
Based on the between firm differences analysis, we 
found that while the control firms performance measures 
were  significantly outperformed in  general, the treatment 
firms  performance  was  significantly  higher  in  the  last 
quarter.  Thus, H2 is partially supported.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 

The 

information  security  breach 

incidents  have 
 
grown  significantly  over  the  past  few  years  [8].    As  a 
consequence,  business  organizations  can  suffer 
the 
enormous  financial  losses  and  thus,  information  security 
becomes  a  major  concern  for  top  managers.    However, 
quantifying  actual  costs  of  security  breaches 
is  a 
challenging  task.    Up  to  date,  there  are  only  a  few 
previous  studies  that  have  investigated  the  impact  of  the 
breach employing an event study methodology.   

 
Our  study  investigated  the  impact  of  information 
security  breaches  on  firm  performance  of  breached  firms 
in the subsequent four quarters following the breach.  We 
compared  financial  performance  of  the  breached  firms 
with performance of the matching peer firms that have not 
experienced  the  breach  and  determined  if  the  breached 
firms  performance  is  decreased  compared  to  the  control 
firms  performance.    Although  the  treatment  firms 
performance  did  not  decrease  in  the  subsequent  quarters 
following  the  breach,  we  found  that  return  on  assets  has 
decreased  in  the  third  quarter.    When  we  compared  the 
performance between the treatment and control firms, the 

control firms outperformed the treatment firms in general.  
However,  the  treatment  firms  sales  were  significantly 
higher  in  the  fourth  quarter  than  those  of  the  control 
firms.    

 
Our  research  findings  are  in  line  with  one  of 
competing  arguments  regarding  the  economic  impact  of 
information  security  breaches  [5].    Our  results  suggested 
that  information  security  breaches  have  minimal  long-
term  economic  impact.    One  possible  explanation  is  that 
the  breached  firms  respond  to  the  breach  incident  by 
making  additional  security  investment  to  prevent  from 
any  future  breaches.    This  can  lead  to  either  help  reduce 
the negative reputation of the firm caused by the breach or 
even  have  a  positive  long-term  economic  impact  on  the 
firm.    Another  explanation  is  that  as  the  time  passes, 
people forget about what happened earlier and the impact 
of  the  breach  on  financial  performance  phases  out  over 
the long-term.    

  We believe our study made an important contribution 
to  security  research  since  there  are  no  previous  studies 
that  have  investigated  the  impact  of  information  security 
breaches  on  financial  performance.    However,  our  study 
has  some  limitation.    Our  sample  includes  only  19 
security  breaches  involving  confidential  data.    Thus,  the

small sample size limits the generalizability of the results.  
Another  limitation  of  our  study  is  that  accounting 
measures  might  not  be  the  best  measure  to  evaluate  the 
impact  of  security  breaches  although  they  are  the  most 
commonly  used  financial  performance  measure  in  the 
previous studies.  

 
Further  research  is  needed  including  more  current 
security  breach  events  and  different  types  of  events  to 
evaluate  the  impact  of  security  breach  by  type.    Finally, 
investigating  these  firms  using  a  case  study  approach 
would offer additional insights about the differences.
