MAJOR  FINDINGS

Almost half of Earth's original forest cover is gone, much of
it destroyed within the past three decades.

Today, just one fifth of the world's original forest cover
remains in large tracts of relatively undisturbed forest  -
what WRI  calls 

frontierforest

Three countries -  Russia, Canada, and Brazil -  house
almost 70 percent of the world's remaining frontier  forest.

40 percent of forest on Earth today qualifies as frontier forest.

Seventy-six countries assessed in this study have lost all  of
their frontier  forest.

39 percent of Earth's remaining frontier  forest is
threatened by logging, agricultural clearing, and other
human activity.

Only 3 percent of the world's frontier forest falls entirely
within the temperate zone (regions characterized by
moderate climate, including much of the U.S and Europe).
Today, temperate forests are the most endangered frontier
forests of all.

Half of today's frontier forest lies in boreal regions within
Canada, Russia, and Alaska -  inhospitable northern zones
between temperate forest and tundra.

Outside of boreal regions, about 75 percent of the world's
frontier forest is threatened.

Eleven countries - including Finland, Sweden, Vietnam,
Guatemala and Thailand -  are on the verge of losing their
frontier forest.  These countries maintain less than 5 percent
of their original forest as frontier, and all of it is threatened.

T he World Resources Institute (WRI) is an independent center for

policy research and technical assistance on global environmental
and development issues.  WRTs mission is to move human society
to live in ways that protect Earth's environment and its capacity to provide
for the needs and aspirations of current and future generations.

Because people are inspired by ideas, empowered by knowledge, and

moved to change by greater understanding, the Institute provides -  and
helps other institutions provide -  objective information and practical
proposals for policy and institutional change that will foster environmentally
sound, socially equitable development.  WRI's particular concerns are with
globally significant environmental problems and their interaction with
economic development and social equity at all levels.

The Institute's current areas of work include economics, forests, bio-

diversity, climate change, energy, sustainable agriculture, resource and
environmental information, trade, technology, national strategies for envi-
ronmental and resource management, business liaison, and human health.

In all of its policy research and work with institutions, WRI tries to
build bridges between ideas and action, meshing the insights of scientific
research, economic and institutional analyses, and practical experience
with the need for open and participatory decision-making.

WORLD  RESOURCES  INSTITUTE

FOREST  FRONTIERS  INITIATIVE

T he word "frontier"  con-

jures up notions of new
challenges, of new lands,
or new intellectual endeavors ripe
for human exploitation and devel-
opment. If a frontier  is out there,
people will not be far behind.

The frontier vision often saw

trees as a commodity at best or
simply an obstacle in the way of
progress. Over many centuries,
about half of the world's forests  -
almost 3 billion hectares - were
burned, cleared, or cut down. Just
one fifth of the world's original
forest cover remains in large
undisturbed tracts today, and the
cutting has accelerated: about 16
million hectares are cut or burned
each year. In the course of this
devastation, we are losing species
and a valuable cornucopia of
resources, altering the
atmosphere's composition and
brutally degrading ecosystems.

FOREWORD

Road building and other

infrastructure development,  often
accompanying logging, mining,
or other large investments, are
also proceeding quickly. Once the
way is paved, population pressure
and landlessness in some parts of
the world, especially developing
countries, can prompt migration
into frontier regions and rapid
deforestation by small land hold-
ers and large land speculators.

There are better ways to use,
manage and preserve forests. The
reach of human ingenuity extends
to the stewardship of trees, but at
the frontiers the destruction
continues.

This report describes for the
first time the location and status of
the world's frontier  forests -  the
large, ecologically intact, and rel-
atively undisturbed natural forests
that still remain. Working with
several partners, including the
World Conservation Monitoring
Centre, the World Wildlife Fund,
and 90 forest experts, WRI devel-
oped a first map of frontier  forest
areas, assembling in one place
unprecedented location-specific
information on current and future
threats to forest integrity.

Using a geographic  infor-

mation system, WRI has developed
a single global database and a
preliminary series of regional
maps depicting the world's frontier
forests - both first of their kinds. In
the coming years, WRI will update
and improve these maps and get
their obvious message to the
world's decision-makers.

This report is the opening
salvo of WRI's Forest Frontiers
Initiative, a five-year, multi-
disciplinary effort to promote
stewardship in and around the
world's last major frontier  forests
by influencing investment, policy,
and public opinion.

For each forest  frontier

region -  in Amazonia, Central
Africa, Asia, North America, and
Russia - WRI is building a
network of policy-makers, activists,
investors, and researchers to
promote alternatives to forest
destruction that take advantage of
the full economic potential of
forests, not just immediate
revenue from logging and forest
clearing. As part of this effort,
WRI will help build the capacity of
local organizations to carry on
this work independently.

The business community is

an important partner in this effort.
We are working with others to
develop case studies with innova-
tive firms to demonstrate the busi-
ness impacts and opportunities
that sustainability presents.

We must act quickly.

Transnational logging companies
are already operating in Siberia
and Canada and rapidly expanding
operations into South America, the
Caribbean Rim, and Central
Africa. Within the next five years,
many pending and proposed
contracts will be signed, and the
leverage of governments and non-
governmental organizations will
be greatly diminished.

At the same time, mainstream
industry and investors are increas-
ingly open to change. There is a
significant opportunity to increase
market demand for "green" timber.
WRI is already a backer of the
Forest Stewardship Council, the
first international organization
created to evaluate, accredit, and
monitor organizations that  certify-
sustainably produced forest prod-
ucts. Meanwhile, many developing
countries are searching for practical
policy alternatives to destructive
timber harvest agreements.

We are deeply grateful to the
AVINA Group and the Netherlands
Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their
general support for the Forest
Frontiers Initiative and to the
Wallace Global Fund for supporting
this project.

FOREST  FRONTIERS 

INITIATIVE

By now, most people who

read a newspaper or
watch television know
that deforestation is a serious
problem, particularly in the
tropics. This World Resources
Institute (WRI) analysis shows
that we have lost almost half
almost 3 billion hectares - of the
forests that once blanketed the
earth.  Every year at least 16 mil-
lion additional hectares fall to the
ax, torch, bulldozer, or chain saw.u
Hidden behind such  familiar

statistics, however, is another,
equally sobering reality. Of the
forests that do remain standing,
the vast majority are no more
than small or highly disturbed
pieces of the My  functioning
ecosystems they once were. These
modified forests should not be

with a concept of frontier that is
based on stewardship -  taking
responsibility for the forest and
ensuring that its riches will be
available for future  generations.
Good stewardship may mean
complete protection of some
frontier  forests combined with
careful management of portions
of others for both timber and
non-timber products.

The change must happen

soon: over the coming years,
citizens, policy-makers, industry
leaders, and others have a chance
to decide the fate of the world's
last frontier  forests. The key
decisions before us are windows
of opportunity that may never
open again.

INTRODUCTION

Hidden behind familiar statistics is an equally sober-

ing reality.  Of the forests that do remain

standing,  the  vast majority are  no more than small
or highly disturbed pieces of the fully functioning

ecosystems they once were.

forgotten, of course. They are the
last refuge for some of the world's
most endangered species and they
provide important economic
products and  environmental
services. Yet, they may have lost
their ability to sustain themselves
in the long term. To support their
full complement of plant and
animal inhabitants,  fragmented
forests will probably need regular
interventions by resource
managers.

In contrast, frontier  forests -
large, ecologically intact, and rela-
tively undisturbed natural forests -
are likely to survive  indefinitely
without human assistance. (See
Box  1 and the Technical
Annex.)  Within these forests,
natural ecological and evolutionary
processes will continue to

generate and maintain the
biodiversity upon which we all
rely. Frontier forests also contribute
a large portion of the ecological
services -  such as watershed
protection and climate
stabilization - that make the
planet habitable. And they are
home to many of the world's
remaining indigenous peoples.

Keeping Earth's last  frontier
forests will require a  fundamental
shift in how we view them. From
the American Wild West of the
1800s to Russia's Far East and the
South American Amazon today,
frontiers have been seen as
limitless providers of land, timber,
gold, wildlife, and other sources
of wealth. Careless and  wasteful,
a typical frontier economy mines
the forest for a quick profit and
moves on.

A s large, intact ecosys-

tems, frontier forests  dif-
fer fundamentally  from

the fragmented or otherwise
modified forests that dominate the
landscape today. For one thing,
frontier forests are large enough
to provide a safe haven for all of
their indigenous species. To
ensure long-term survival, far-
ranging animals such as grizzly
bears, harpy eagles, and wolves
need blocks of natural habitat
thousands, if not tens of
thousands, of square  kilometers in
size. 3A5

W HY  DO FRONTIER  FORESTS  MATTER?

Fragmented forests, on the

other hand, are probably too
small to support their full  com-
plement of species in the coming
centuries.6  Smaller tracts are
also vulnerable to processes
beyond their borders. In the
United States, for example, the
nests of songbirds in small forest
patches are under heavy attack by
cowbirds, bluejays, raccoons, and
other animals that thrive along
forest edges.7  Many non-frontier
forests also lack the natural  fea-
tures that native species rely on:
In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the
spotted owl and marbled murrelet
-  birds that depend on large,
standing dead trees typically
found in old-growth forests - are
threatened by logging of these
ecosystems.8

Secure habitats for  indige-
nous species, frontier forests are
invaluable refuges for global biodi-
versity. Between 50 and 90 percent
of all terrestrial species inhabit the
world's forests,9  and many of
them are threatened by extinc-
tion, primarily because of  habitat
loss. (See Figure 1)  By main-
taining these last strongholds we
protect the biodiversity within
them and provide a source for
recolonizing non-frontier  and
restored forests with native
species. Beyond its obvious intrin-
sic value, biodiversity supplies
humans with food, medicines,
and many other staples needed to
survive and make a living.

More than safe houses for
genes and species under siege,
frontier forests maintain complex
and inimitable  ecological com-
munities and processes.  Vast and
undisturbed, they give free play to
nature and to such natural events
as wildfires and seed dispersal by
large herbivores, both of which
determine the  composition and
distribution of species. Such nat-
ural processes create unique habi-
tats, including ancient stands of
"old-growth" forest.

// is time to replace out-
dated thinking with a
concept of frontier that

is based on
stewardship.

As large, intact ecosystems

governed by nature, frontier forests
provide baseline information on
how such systems should work.
Just as doctors use standard body
temperature and blood pressure to
determine health, ecologists study
natural forests to evaluate the
impact of different human inter-
ventions -  asking, for instance,
how forest clearing might affect
local rainfall patterns. The results
help land managers find ways to
lighten the human footprint in
heavily used landscapes.

More recently, erosion since

1950 due to deforestation is respon-
sible for the loss of 580 million
hectares of fertile land worldwide,
an area bigger than all of Western
Europe.12  Loss of large forested
watersheds is blamed for heavier
flooding in India's Ganges Valley,
and government losses of $1 bil-
lion a year in property damage.13
By carefully managing what's left
of the world's frontier forests, we
can dramatically reduce such
environmental side effects and
costs.

Dwindling frontier  forests
are also home to many of the
world's last indigenous cultures.
About 50 million indigenous peo-
ple live in tropical forests alone.14
Amazonian forests house at least
400 indigenous groups -1  million
people in all.15  Wiping out
indigenous cultures by transform-
ing forests is a moral crime. And
when these cultures vanish, so
does a gold mine of useful infor-
mation about the natural world.

All forests help maintain the

environmental conditions that
make life possible, from regional
hydrologic cycles to global cli-
mate. But huge frontiers are par-
ticularly important. Frontier forest
ecosystems store tremendous
amounts of carbon, for example -
approximately 433 billion tonnes,
or more than all carbon that will
be released from fossil fuel burn-
ing and cement manufacture over
the next 69 years, at current glob-
al emission rates.10  Without these
forests, this carbon would go
straight into the atmosphere as
carbon dioxide, a powerful green-
house gas.

Protecting and responsibly
managing our last frontiers today
will help countries avoid paying
the high costs associated with
massive forest loss and degrada-
tion. History abounds with exam-
ples of civilizations that foundered
after deforestation led to soil ero-
sion, river siltation, wood short-
ages, and other banes of
agricultural and industrial produc-
tivity. These doomed civilizations
include ancient societies in
Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean,
and Central America."

Frontier forests are
invaluable refuges for
global biodiversity.

A legacy inherited from our

ancestors, Earth's last frontier
forests may indeed be the most
valuable gift we can leave for our
children. Guardians of biodiversity,
indigenous cultures, and ecological
processes, frontiers also provide
recreational and ecotourism
opportunities. Because so many
irreplaceable forests have already
disappeared, the worth to future
generations of those that remain is
greater than ever.

Above and beyond practical

considerations is the very real
aesthetic and spiritual need just to
know that remote and wild places
remain on our crowded planet.
One concrete reflection of this
need is the considerable sum of
money many people pay to visit
such places. But even to many
people who will never see them,
wild plants and animals, along
with the forests that house them,
have an inalienable right to exist.
Certainly, as Earth's most power-
ful species, we have a responsibil-
ity to ensure their survival.

WHAT  DO  WE  KNOW  ABOUT  THE WORLD'S  FORESTS?

S urprisingly, we know

very little about the status
of the world's forests as a
whole. Most monitoring
efforts are confined to individual
countries, and the results often do
not compute across borders.

Sponsored by the United

Nations (U.N.), the most compre-
hensive study of the world's
forests to date estimates recent
deforestation, but gives no
information on the overall
condition of remaining forest.16
This U.N. study cost $4 million  -
less than one eighth the amount
U.S. citizens spend each day on
newspapers. 17'18

People need to know that remote and  wild places

remain on our crowded planet,

To help fill the gap, WRI asked
the World Conservation Monitoring
Centre (WCMC) to develop a map
of Earth's forest cover as it appeared
8,000 years ago.  The result repre-
sents the first detailed attempt to
show what the world's original
forest cover looked like before
humans began transforming it.

The WRI map also shows

current forest cover, drawing
from an earlier  WCMC map that
provides the most comprehensive
image of total forest cover today.
Though based on the best available
data, the WCMC current forest

cover map is far from complete.
Many areas depicted as forested
can hardly be considered forest.
Some are heavily degraded by
logging and other activities, while
others are single-species
plantations. A rough picture of
where forests are is invaluable,
but until WRI's assessment virtually
nothing was known about their
condition on a global scale.

FOREST  FRONTIERS  INITIATIVE

Most information on
forests is scattered far
and wide and buried

within the  walls of
isolated institutions.
Much lives only in  the

minds of biologists
and foresters who  are
experts on  a single

forest region.

WRI's  FRONTIER  FORESTS  ASSESSMENT

M ost of the tremendous

amount of informa-
tion on individual

forests that exists is scattered far
and wide and buried within the
walls of  isolated institutions.
Much of it lives only in the minds
of biologists and foresters who are
experts on a single forest region.

Working with several

partners - including WCMC and
the World Wildlife Fund -WRI
wove together some of this
diverse data, knowledge, and
expertise.  First we developed a
preliminary map of "candidate
frontier forests" - large forested
areas with few roads or modern
settlements - and sent it to 90
forest experts around the world.
Using criteria WRI developed, ten
to fifteen  experts for each region
commented on proposed frontier
areas - confirming sites as fron-
tier forests, rejecting sites, or
redrawing their shape and
boundaries. (See Box 1)  19

WRFs maps provide

the first realistic

picture of the location

and status of the

world's frontier forests.

Experts also supplied infor-
mation on the status of frontiers
they identified - if and how these
forests are endangered by devel-
opment. They also answered our
queries about future threats, spec-
ifying whether frontiers were in
timber concessions or housed
such high-value resources as
timber, oil, or gold.

Using a geographic informa-
tion system,20  WRI combined all
of these site-specific data into a
single global database and a series
of regional maps. (See Maps 2-7.)
Far from perfect, these maps
nonetheless provide the first real-
istic picture of the location and
status of the world's frontier
forests. In the coming months and
years, WRI will work with partners
around the globe to update and
improve the maps as more infor-
mation becomes available and to
get them to decision-makers in
whose hands the fate of frontier
forests rests.

FOREST  FRONTIERS  INITIATIVE

"

FRONTIER  FORESTS  are 
the
world's remaining large intact
natural forest ecosystems. These
forests are -  on the whole  -
relatively undisturbed and big
enough to maintain all of their
biodiversity, including viable
populations of the  wide-ranging
species associated with each forest
type. As  defined in this assess-
ment, a frontier  forest must
meet seven criteria:

1.  It is primarily forested.
2.  It is big enough to support
viable populations of all
indigenous species associated
with that forest type -  measured
by the forest's ability to support
wide-ranging animal species
(such as elephants, harpy
eagles, or brown bears).
3.  It is large enough to keep
these species' populations viable
even in the face of the  natural
disasters -  such as hurricanes,
fires, and pest or disease out-
breaks -  that might occur there
in a century.

4.  Its structure and composition
are determined mainly by  natural
events, though limited human
disturbance by traditional
activities of the  sort that have
shaped forests for thousands of
years  -  such as low-density
shifting cultivation -  is accept-
able. As  such, it remains rela-
tively unmanaged by humans,
and natural disturbances (such
as fire) are permitted to shape
much of the  forest.
5.  In forests where patches of
trees of different ages would
naturally occur, the landscape
exhibits this type of
heterogeneity.
6.  It is dominated by indigenous
tree species.
7.  It is home to most, if not all,
of the  other plant and animal
species that typically live in this
type of forest.

THREATENED  FRONTIER
FORESTS  are forests where
ongoing or planned human
activities (such as logging,
agricultural clearing, and
mining) will eventually degrade
the ecosystem (through, for
example, declines in or local
extinctions of plants and animals
or large-scale changes in the
forest's age and structure).

LOW-THREAT  POTENTIALLY
VULNERABLE  FRONTIER
FORESTS are those not now
considered under enough
pressure to degrade ecosystems.
But because they are unprotected
and contain valuable natural
resources, or because human
encroachment is likely, most of
these forests are vulnerable to
future degradation and
destruction.

NON-FRONTIER  FORESTS
are dominated by secondary
forests, plantations, degraded
forest, and patches of primary
forest that do not meet this
study's frontier  criteria (even
though some might be restored
as frontier forest). This category
includes some of the  world's
most unique, valuable, and
endangered forest types, includ-
ing the biologically rich, highly
fragmented  forests of Madagascar
and Central Europe's last stands
of old-growth forest. Such
forests are high priorities for
conservation.  Non-frontier
forests are also important
because they provide us with a
wide range of economic goods
and services.

ORIGINAL  FOREST  is that
estimated to have covered the
planet about 8,000 years ago,
before large-scale disturbance
by modern society began.

A note about  the  data:

This study's  results
represent estimates  of the
extent and  location of
frontier  forests  as well as
threats to their  survival
Incomplete  information
from  some parts  of the
world and difficulties
estimating  the  magnitude
of threats make the  data
suitable  only for  regional
comparisons  and  for
distinguishing  major
differences among
countries  forests.  This
study  did  not assess
woodland  areas  of the
world, or forests  within
many  island  countries.

FALLING  FRONTIERS

Temperate forests, on the

other hand, are the most heavily
fragmented  and disturbed of all
forest types. This study concludes
that just 3 percent of today's fron-
tier forests are temperate stands
(another 5 percent contains both
temperate and either boreal or
tropical frontier  forest). Thriving
in a moderate climate, pristine
temperate forests once extended
throughout most of Europe, much
of China and the continental
United States, as well as parts of
Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
Chile, and Argentina.

Thanks to their  favorable

climate and fertile soils, temperate
forests were the first to be cleared
wholesale by humans.  By 1000
B.C.,  most of eastern China's
forests had been converted to
farmland.21  More than 2,000
years ago, the Greeks and
Romans destroyed much of the
forest that rimmed the
Mediterranean.22'23  Today, the
frontier forests of the Middle East
and Mediterranean Basin are
completely gone. Western
Europe's frontier forests were
leveled during the Middle Ages as
new cities and towns spread
throughout the region.24

According to this
assessment just

22 percent of Earth's

original forest
remains in large,
relatively natural

ecosystems.

What  Happened to the Forests That Once Covered  the Earth?

N early half -  46 percent

-of  the world's forest
has been converted to
farms, pastures, and other uses
over the past 80 centuries. While
just over half remains, most of it
has been heavily altered by people
and bears little resemblance to
pristine forest. According to this
assessment just 22 percent of
Earth's original forest remains in
large, relatively natural ecosystems.
(See Figure 2.)

Of the remaining frontier
forest that is left, nearly half  is
boreal forest. (See Figure 3J  A
broad belt of primarily coniferous
trees, boreal forests lie between
arctic tundra to the north and
warmer, temperate forests to the
south. They blanket much of
Alaska, Canada, Russia, and
Scandinavia.

For two reasons, boreal

forests have been less disturbed
than have other forest types. First,
long winters, poor soils, and other
factors make farming difficult,  so
little forest has been converted to
agriculture.  Second, boreal trees,
particularly in northern areas,
tend to be slow-growing,
scrawny, and widely dispersed.
So until modern technology,
increasing wood demand and
other factors changed the picture,
commercial loggers traditionally
had little incentive to exploit
boreal forests.

Worldwide, most frontier

forests are now restricted to scat-
tered, widely dispersed pockets,
many located in inaccessible
mountains or swamps. Europe  -
which has already lost two thirds
of its historical forest cover  -
maintains only a few small patches
of frontier forest totalling less than
1 percent of the original, all in
Sweden and Finland.

The lion's share of today's

frontier forest -  more than 75 per-
cent -  is located in just three large
tracts covering parts of seven
countries: two blocks of boreal
forest -  one stretching across
much of Canada and Alaska and
the other in Russia -  and one
large relatively undisturbed chunk
of tropical forest spanning the
Northwestern Amazon Basin and
Guyana Shield.

The lion's share of today's frontier forests -  more  than

75 percent-is  located in just  three large tracts

covering parts  of seven countries.

Until this century, tropical

forests -  located in warm regions
within 30 degrees of the equator  -
remained largely intact. In the
past few decades, however, they
have fallen with alarming speed.
Between i960 and 1990, some 450
million hectares were cleared -  a
fifth  of the  world's entire tropical
forest cover. (See  Figure  4.)

Millions more hectares have

been degraded by logging,
agricultural clearing, and the
removal of vegetation for
fuelwood, building materials, and
livestock feed. In Asia and Africa,
for example, this study found that
though roughly a third of the
original forest cover remains, less
than  10 percent of this original
cover still qualifies as frontier
forest. (See Table 1)

peoples had long lived in and
shaped these forests, newcomers
wrought far more dramatic
changes. (See  Box 2.)  Even so,
almost all of the  world's remain-
ing temperate frontier  forests are
in these three regions.

As places that conjure up
images of vast, empty spaces,
frontiers are associated with many
popular myths that contribute to
their destruction. In each case, the
reality is far more complex. Three
of the more common myths about
frontier forests are:

FRONTIER
MYTH:  Frontiers are comprised
of empty wilderness.

FOREST  MYTHS
MYTH:  Forest peoples live in
Utopian harmony with nature.

REALITY:  People have lived in
many forests for hundreds of
generations, mostly in small
groups. Forests today house several
hundred million people in Asia
alone,25  while at least 20 million
people live in the Amazon Basin.26
Low-level human activity over
thousands of years within these
areas has helped shape the forest
structure and species mix in frontier
ecosystems.

REALITY:  Long before European
colonization, forest peoples managed
their natural resources according to
customary practices.  Evidence
suggests that some human cultures
destroyed their own forest ecosystems
through abuse, and others in tribal
warfare.27'28  Today, rising
populations, land shortages, and
access to sophisticated technologies
pose further management
challenges for forest peoples.

MYTH:  Frontiers consist of fertile
land, ripe for development.

REALITY: 
In many places, frontier
forests remain undeveloped because
their soils are poor and they don't
have much commercially valuable
timber per hectare. In many tropical
forests, for instance, intensive agri-
cultural activity can rapidly deplete
soils that need natural debris from
the tree canopy.  Then too, forests
are finite, and some are inaccessible.
Forests in Amazonia and in Central
Africa, for example, are rich in
biodiversity but they often lack high
densities of valuable timber species
or good soils.29

M any of the frontier

forests that have
survived into this

century may not make it into the
next. Results from this study
suggest that 39 percent of the
world's remaining frontiers are
threatened - that is, under
moderate or high threat - by
logging, agricultural clearing, and
other activities, often along the
forest edges.  Many frontier  forests
not yet threatened - particularly
those in the tropics - are still
vulnerable because they contain
valuable timber, oil, or minerals.

Most of the safest  frontier

forests  are in the far north, where
resource-extraction costs are
high. Taking these forests out of
the global calculus changes it sig-
nificantly: outside Russia and
Canada, three quarters of the
world's frontier forests - includ-
ing virtually all temperate forest
frontiers - are at risk.

The most important threats
to frontier forests are described
below:
  LOGGING: This study
suggests that commercial logging
poses by far the greatest danger to
frontier forests. In all six regions
assessed, WRI's advisors cited
logging as the predominate threat
to forests - affecting more than 70
percent of the world's threatened
frontiers. (See Table 2.) Logging
can significantly "rewrite" the
structure and composition of
forests.  Yet, some of its most
negative effects are indirect:

logging offsets the cost of road-
building to extract the timber,
which in turn opens forests to
hunting, fuelwood gathering, and
clearing for agriculture. Widely
considered the primary cause of
tropical deforestation (when  fron-
tier and non-frontier  forest are
taken together), agricultural
clearing, in particular, is hastened
once loggers open forests up.30'31

  ENERGY  DEVELOPMENT,

MINING,  AND  NEW
INFRASTRUCTURE: Large-scale
mining and exploration for petro-
leum and natural gas also bring
new roads and settlements that
open once-inaccessible forests to
other human activities. Damming
rivers for hydroelectric power
floods  millions of hectares of

forest  and disrupts freshwater
ecosystems. These operations also
take up forest land and spew
pollution into the environment.
Energy development, mining,
and the roads, pipelines, and
settlements that come with it
represent the second biggest
threat to frontier forests globally,
affecting close to 40 percent of all
frontiers classified as under
moderate or high threat.

  LAND  CLEARING  FOR
AGRICULTURE:  One fifth of the
world's threatened frontiers are
directly endangered by farmers
who clear forest for cropland and
pasture.  Land clearing is particu-
larly rapacious in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America.  This threat
can only grow as population
increases. For the record, results
from WRI's study suggest that
non-frontier  forests - often criss-
crossed by roads and easily acces-
sible - are under much greater
pressure from farmers than are
frontier  forests.

  EXCESSIVE  VEGETATION
REMOVAL: Apart from logging
and outright clearing, humans
are removing millions of tons of
vegetation from frontier  forests,
pulling at the fabric of these
ecosystems.  WRI found that
about 14 percent of the world's
threatened frontiers are being
degraded by overgrazing or the
overcollection of firewood, build-
ing materials, and other vegeta-
tion. Besides damaging terrestrial
habitats, excessive vegetation
removal causes the rivers and
streams that run through these
forests to silt up.

In most cases, frontier  forests
are endangered by more than one
of these threats. One future threat
not covered in this study is the
potential impact of global warming
on forest ecosystems. Native
species that can't adapt or migrate
to new habitats quickly enough
could die out rapidly as climate
changes and new diseases, pest
infestations, and natural distur-
bances increase as a result.32

  OVERHUNTING: As eCOSyS
terns, frontier forests comprise
more than just trees. Local
extinctions of animal species can
affect the integrity of the entire
forest. Many species - including
elephants in Africa and beaver in
North America - distribute tree
seeds and otherwise shape forest
structure. In Africa, one third of
the forest frontier which is
threatened is at risk through
commercial hunting, driven
largely by urban demand for
bushmeat.

  OTHER  THREATS: On a
smaller scale, other activities also
endanger frontier forests. They
range from the obvious -  forest
conversion to, say, tree planta-
tions or ski resorts - to the not so
obvious. Among the latter are
forest managers who suppress
natural fires which help shape
many frontier ecosystems,  far-off
factories that emit wind-borne
pollutants harmful to trees, and
exotic animal species introduced
either accidentally or deliberately
by people who don't know or
don't care that the newcomers
can outcompete native plants and
animals for scarce resources. (In
New Zealand, our advisors con-
cluded that introduced and feral
species - domestic species gone
wild - pose the single greatest
danger to frontier  forests.)

  POPULATION  GROWTH
AND  DEMAND  FOR  NEW
LAND: Just since  1950, the
world's population has more  than
doubled.33 As a result, in  many
regions, forests  have been  cleared
to grow food  and to make way  for
new settlements.  Population
growth also drives up demand  for
timber,  paper,  fuelwood,  and
other products from  an  ever-
shrinking forest  base.

  GROWING  ECONOMIES
AND  CONSUMPTION: Even in
parts of the world where  popula-
tion is not growing  significantly,
demand  for certain  forest
resources -  for both local  and
export markets -  is  intensifying
as economies expand.  Between
1961 and  1994, per  capita
consumption  of paper  increased
by 86 percent globally and by 350
percent in developing countries.
(See Figure  5.)  Industrialized

times as much paper  per  person
than  people in developing  regions
do.  Global consumption  of indus-

FOREST  FRONTIERS  INITIATIVE

  POVERTY  AND
LANDLESSNESS  In Brazil,
Guatemala, and elsewhere, the
poor flock to frontier  forests in
search of agricultural land and
other economic opportunities.
Rather than grapple with such
politically thorny issues as land
redistribution and tenure,
governments often encourage the
clearing of forest lands poorly
suited to agriculture. In Brazil, for
example, migrants have had to
clear forest to establish land
ownership, a "don't think twice"
policy that spawned more defor-
estation and discouraged settlers
from managing frontiers for their
forest products.39

  BAD  ECONOMIC  POLICIES:
In weighing land-management
options, economists and policy-
makers often overlook the costs of
losing frontier  forest. Such costs
may come in the form of soil
erosion, the loss of water for
agriculture, and release of carbon
into the atmosphere. Lost oppor-
tunities should count too,
including foregone income from
ecotourism,  "bio-prospecting",
and other lucrative uses of whole
and healthy forests. Even logging,
mining and other exploitative
uses often don't bring in the
revenues they could: trying to
attract foreign investors, many
national governments all but give
away valuable rights to exploit
their forests.  Such economic
decisions are common because
the costs of destruction are not felt
or paid by those doing the dam-
age.  Frequently, governments and
industry reap the profits while
frontier  peoples receive only a
sliver of the benefits but bear the
environmental brunt of forest
mismanagement.

El 

DIFFER
OF  RANKII

EIMT  WAYS
MG  COUNTRIES

WRI's Forest Frontiers Index

speaks volumes about the coun-
tries' opportunities to protect fron-
tier forests and about the immedi-
acy of threats to these frontiers.
Alternative methods for ranking
countries tell different stories.
Table 4, for example, identifies
the 12 countries with the largest
area of frontier forest.  All told,
these countries account for 90
percent of what remains on
Earth. Table 5 lists countries with
frontier forest likely to be of

exceptional biodiversity value
(based on the large numbers of
plant species estimated to be
found within them).

One important story -

beyond the scope of this assess-
ment - would be to rank countries
according to the amount of
threatened forest lying outside
frontiers. Such an index would be
useful for identifying countries
where unique forest ecosystems
are on the verge of extinction.

  SHORT-SIGHTED
POLITICAL  DECISIONS: In much
of the world, frontier  forests are
sacrificed for short-term political
gain -  to appease interest groups
or to line the pockets of politicians
and their allies. In endangered
U.S. and Canadian old-growth
forests, for example, governments
allow logging to provide question-
able job security for a very small
number of people who may soon
be sidelined by technological and
market changes within the indus-
try anyway. In tropical countries
such as Brazil, Indonesia, and
Malaysia, decision-makers attack
poverty by moving millions of
people to the forest frontier,  even
though this approach is only a
temporary fix for the poor and
can permanently destroy the
forests.

  CORRUPTION  AND
ILLEGAL TRADE: Corruption
among officials in government,
industry, and other organizations
often hastens frontier  forest loss.
In Cambodia, for example, the
military takes part in a  thriving
illegal timber trade with neigh-
boring Thailand.34  In Burma, the
government and rebel groups
have both financed a decades-
long civil war with illegal logging
proceeds.35 In Alaska, Malaysia,
Suriname, and elsewhere, timber
companies have been accused of
engaging in timber smuggling,
trying to bribe government
officials to procure lucrative
concessions, and other illegal
practices.36'37  Even demand for
illegal drugs fuels forest destruc-
tion: in Colombia, for example,
clearings are carved out of remote
frontier  forests to grow coca,
marijuana,  and opium poppies.38

W RI's Frontier Forest

Index shows that
most of the world's

nations have already lost, or
might soon lose, their last  frontier
forests. (See Table 3.)  The index
ranks countries according to the
percentage of frontier forest lost
and to the proportion of remain-
ing frontier that is moderately or
highly threatened -  in other
words, high-scoring countries
have lost much of their  frontier,
and most of what remains is
threatened.

Seventy-six countries have

lost it all.  These include almost all
of the countries of Europe and
Eastern Africa and all of North
Africa and the Middle East.  For
these countries, forest restoration
should be a priority.  (See Box  4.)

T HE  FRONTIER  F O R E ST  INDEX

Only seven countries -

Brazil, Suriname, Guyana,
Canada, Colombia, Venezuela, and
Russia -  and one Overseas
Department of France (French
Guiana), still have a large
proportion of their original forest
cover remaining in an unthreat-
ened state. These nations have
great opportunities to sustain
large areas of frontier  forest if
they begin to follow stewardship
principles now. (See Box  5J

Even in these eight places,

some frontiers are under siege. In
Canada, two thirds of British
Columbia's temperate coastal
rainforest -  one of Earth's biologi-
cally richest temperate ecosystems
-  has been degraded by logging
or other development, and much
of what remains intact outside
protected areas is slated for
logging in coming years. **
International timber companies
have been trying to negotiate
contracts to log much of the
remaining Amazon and Guyana
Shield frontier - including one
third of Suriname's forests.41
Decisions made within the next
few years will decide the fate of
frontier  forests within these
countries.

Another 11 countries -
including Nigeria, Thailand,
Sweden, Finland and Guatemala  -
are classified as on the edge. They
have at most 5 percent of their
original frontier left, and it is
threatened.  While core areas of
these isolated frontiers may be
protected in parks or reserves,
logging and other activities out-
side (and sometimes inside)
protected areas threaten the
ecosystems as a whole. Unless
these countries act immediately,
they are likely to lose most of the
little frontier they have left.

In 28 countries, there is not
much time to protect remaining
frontier forests. Most of these
nations have lost most of their
original frontier,  and much of the
remainder is threatened. These
countries include the United States
(which, if not for Alaska's vast
boreal forest, would rank among
countries "on the edge"), Papua
New Guinea, Malaysia, Panama,
Mexico, Argentina, India, and
Australia.

FOREST  FRONTIERS  INITIATIVE

NORTH  AND  CENTRAL
AMERICA

After Russia's, the world's

largest expanse of frontier  forest is
an unbroken 6,500-kilometer arc
of boreal forest stretching  from
Newfoundland  to Alaska. These
North American forest ecosystems
-  still vast and relatively undis-
turbed in northernmost  Canada
and interior Alaska - store a sig-
nificant proportion ofthe  global
total of biotic carbon and supply
much of the world's growing
demand for forest products. They
also provide livelihoods for thou-
sands of indigenous people and a
refuge for woodland  caribou,
grizzly bear, grey wolf, and other
large mammals that once ranged
widely across the continent.42  As
a group, these frontiers  rank
among the least threatened in the
world (approximately a quarter of
the area is threatened). Even so,
they are being pushed steadily
northward by mineral extraction,
hydroelectric development, and
skyrocketing demand for wood
fiber, especially paper products.

To the south, North

America's temperate  frontier
forests have retreated to a few
remote mountainous pockets in
the western United States and
Canada. Within the lower 48 U.S.
states, frontiers account for about
1 percent of original forest cover.

REGIONAL  OVERVIEWS

North American forest ecosystems store a

significant proportion ofthe global total of biotic
carbon and supply much ofthe world's growing

demand for forest products.

Central America's  frontier
forests are under many kinds of
assault. In the Darien region, the
major threat is completion  ofthe
Pan American highway. (See
below.)  In other areas,
agricultural expansion, logging,
and infrastructure  development
are the dangers. Guatemala's  for-
est frontier,  for example, shrank
dramatically in the past decade as
logging roads opened the area to
landless peasants and to wealthy
agricultural business interests.

On the whole, North

America still has a good number
of frontier  forests in its northern-
most regions that remain  rela-
tively safe. Yet from its southern
band of boreal forests all the way
to Panama's Darien Gap,
virtually all the rest ofthe  conti-
nent's frontiers stand to lose their
frontier  status within the next
decade or two.

What remains lies primarily with-
in three assemblages of national
parks and wilderness areas in the
northern Rockies and one block in
the North Cascades of Washington
state.  While each forest block is
largely protected, they are classi-
fied as threatened because they
are becoming too isolated to sup-
port populations of some of their
large mammal species over time. ^

In Mexico, one relatively
large frontier  remains in the
Sierra Madre Occidental, a biolog-
ically diverse temperate  conifer
forest severely threatened by
rapidly expanding logging and
road construction. Mexico's other
frontier  forests are in Oaxaca,
Chiapas, and the Maya forest
region (which extends into Belize
and Guatemala). These tropical
forests - along with a chain of
others stretching south through
the Miskito coast of Honduras and
Nicaragua, the La Amistad region
on the Costa Rican-Panamanian
border, and the Darien forests on
Panama's border with Colombia -
are almost all highly threatened.

Logging is  the
main threat

to South America's
frontier forests.

SOUTH  AMERICA

Throughout South America,

large-scale resettlement and
agricultural and resource develop-
ment projects claimed much of
the 645,000 square kilometers of
forest lost in this region between
1980 and 1990-the greatest
amount of forest loss in the world
during these years. Brazil alone
lost close to 370,000 square kilo-
meters - more than a fifth of all
tropical forest lost worldwide dur-
ing that time. *

Still, South America main-
tains vast areas of intact tropical
and temperate forest. The
Northern Amazon Basin and the
Guyana Shield house the largest
tropical frontier forests anywhere47

On the rim of the Amazon

Basin, forests of the Northern
Andes (Peru, Ecuador, and
Colombia) rank among Earth's
biologically richest.48  Chile and
Argentina share the largest single
block of remaining temperate
frontier forest in the world.

Logging is the main threat to

South America's frontier  forests,
endangering about 70 percent of
all frontiers classified under
medium or high threat. Energy
exploration, mining, and new
roads are encroaching on about
half the region's threatened
frontiers. Clearing for agriculture
jeopardizes almost a third of all
threatened frontier  forests.

In recent decades, national
development policies have fueled
much of the region's deforestation.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the
Brazilian government's "modern-
ization" policy prompted major
forest clearing in the Amazon.
The government had hoped to
solve land-tenure problems in
other regions by establishing
colonies of small-holder farmers
in the forests, to integrate the
region into the rest of the country
with a massive road network,
earn revenues by developing nat-
ural resources and strengthen
Brazil's borders by populating its
frontier.  Government policies trig-
gered both planned and sponta-
neous immigration of landless
peasants from throughout the
country, and resulted in large-scale
clearing of the forest by land
speculators hoping to profit  from
subsidies provided to cattle
ranchers. 49/5

In Bolivia, Guyana, and
Suriname, a drive to exploit
natural resources over the past
decade -  partly to respond to
economic crises -  has accelerated
the loss of frontier forests.  Only
Venezuela and Colombia have
strongly restricted logging, mining,
and other extractive activities, and
Venezuela may soon buckle under
severe economic pressure to
exploit its rich natural resources.

Chile's temperate frontier

forests are increasingly threatened,
primarily by logging to provide
wood chips (for export mainly to
Japan) and fuelwood. While
Eucalyptus and pine plantations
provide much of the timber needed
for export and industry, precious
native forests are cleared to make
way for new plantations.51/52

THREATENED  FRONTIERS INCLUDE:

Frontier:
1.  THE  ATLANTIC  RAINFOREST
Forest type:  Tropical
Geographic location:  Coastal
Brazil
Threats:  Logging, agricultural
clearing, excessive vegetation
removal, pollution
At Risk:  Only 5 percent of the
original Atlantic Rainforest is left,
and just a fraction of this vestige
can be considered  frontier. The
Atlantic Rainforest is particularly
rich in biodiversity: 70 percent of
its plants and most of its 20 pri-
mate species are found nowhere
else in the world, and the wild
relatives of many important food
crops (including pineapple,
cassava, sweet potato, and
papaya) are found there.

Frontier:
2.  COASTAL CHILEAN  FORESTS
Forest type:  Temperate
Geographic location:  Southern
Chile
Threats:  Clearing for plantations,
logging for the wood-chip industry,
fuelwood production
At Risk:  One third of the world's
largest tract of relatively undis-
turbed temperate forest. Chile's
temperate forests contain at least
50 species of timber trees (95 per-
cent of them endemic) and more
than 700 vascular plant species
(half of them endemic).53 The
alerce cedar, the Southern
Hemisphere's largest conifer and a
tree that can live over 3,000 years,
is found here.54  More than 35,000
families in this region face severe
poverty and expulsion as large
timber companies buy land for
wood-chip production and tree
plantations.

is a part of the Guyana Shield-
Amazon Basin complex, the

Only Brazil

Suriname,  Guyana,
Canada,  Colombia,
Venezuela, Russia,
and French Guiana

still have a large

original forest cover
remaining in  an
unthreatened state.

AFRICA

Except for the Congo Basin,

Africa's frontier  forests have
largely been destroyed, primarily
by loggers and by farmers  clear-
ing land for agriculture. In West
Africa, nearly 90 percent of the
original moist forest is gone, and
what remains is heavily frag-
mented and degraded. Today, West
African frontiers  are restricted to
one patch in Cote d'lvoire and
another along the border between
Nigeria and Cameroon.

To the east, very little

remains of Madagascar's once
magnificent tropical forests. Long
isolated from mainland ecosys-
tems, these forests are home to an
exceptional number of plants and
animals found nowhere else.
Unfortunately,  none of
Madagascar's forest fragments is
large or natural enough to qualify
as a frontier  today.

Large blocks of intact natur-

al forest do remain in Central
Africa, particularly in Zaire,
Gabon, and the Congo. In Zaire -
which contains more than half
this region's forest cover -  many
forests remain intact, in part
because the nation's poor
transportation system can't easily
handle timber and mineral
exploitation.55  Some areas have
fewer passable roads today than
in I960, the year the country
became independent, and some
frontiers have lost population
during this period.

Today, most of Africa's

remaining frontier  forests are at
risk. The two major threats are
logging and commercial hunting
to meet growing urban demand
for bushmeat.  (Overhunting
removes populations of key
species that help maintain natural
forest ecosystems.) In Central
Africa, over 90 percent of all log-
ging occurs in primary forest  -
one of the highest ratios of any
region in the world.56  In some
areas, logging itself causes
relatively little damage because
only a few high-value tree species
are removed. Still, logging roads
open up a forest to hunters,
would-be farmers and other prof-
it-seekers. One region warranting
special concern is eastern Zaire:
Civil unrest in Rwanda, Burundi,
Sudan, and Zaire has driven hun-
dreds of thousands of people into
this area, where they escalate
demands on the forest.

THREATENED  FRONTIERS INCLUDE:

more than 830,000 square kilo-
meters in eight countries west of

EUROPE  AND  RUSSIA

Once blanketed by forest,

Europe and Russia have both lost
virtually all of their temperate
frontier  forest. Most of Europe's
forests were leveled centuries ago.
Although forest area within the
region has increased since 1950,
nearly all of it consists of
plantation or highly managed
forest.57

Europe's last few large tracts
of relatively natural forest are in
Sweden and Finland.  Significant
portions of this frontier  fall out-
side parks and reserves, and all
frontier  forests are threatened by
road development, fire suppres-
sion, grazing, logging, and other
activities.

Already, portions of Russia's

Far East and much of European
Russia (west of the Ural moun-
tains) have been heavily logged.
Until now, lack of infrastructure
and outmoded harvesting prac-
tices kept much of Siberia's fron-
tier forest undeveloped. Recent
economic and political liberaliza-
tion may change the situation,
however. International timber
and trading corporations,
particularly Asian companies, are
looking to Siberian forests as a
new source of supply as burgeoning
global demand for timber strips
other regions of valuable,
accessible trees.60 Over the next
decade or two, foreign capital,
machinery, and road-building
could open much of Siberia's forest
to logging, mining, and other
damaging activities.

Containing Earth's largest

expanse of frontier  forest (mostly
in Siberia), Russia's boreal forests
are still largely intact. The country
houses almost three quarters of all
boreal forest and nearly one  fifth
of the world's total forest area.58
An immense storehouse of living
carbon, the nation's  frontier
forests cover more than 4 million
square kilometers. Clearing them
could contribute significantly to
global warming. Russia's Far
Eastern frontier  is also the last
habitat for such highly endangered
species as the Amur tiger, the Far
Eastern leopard, the Far Eastern
forest cat, the red wolf, and the
sikha deer.59

Endangered frontier  forests
in Russia are threatened mainly
by logging, named by WRI's advi-
sors as the chief risk in about 85
percent of the region's threatened
frontier  forest. Mineral and
energy exploration and set fires
also impinge.

Asia has  lost almost95

forests, and most of
what remains is  con-
fined  to the  islands of
Borneo, Sumatra,

Sulawesi,  and
Man Jaya.

ASIA

Asia has lost almost 95 per-
cent of its frontier  forests. Apart
from the Mediterranean and
Middle East - where all such
forests have disappeared -  this
represents the world's greatest
loss of frontier  forest outside of
Europe.  China and India today
have just 20 percent of their origi-
nal forest cover.  Of these remain-
ing forests, less than 10 percent
can be classified as frontier.  In the
20 years between i960 and 1980
alone, Asia lost almost a third of
its tropical forest cover, the high-
est rate of forest conversion in the
world.62

On mainland Southeast Asia,

most frontiers are gone. The iso-
lated pockets left are confined pri-
marily to Burma, Laos, and
Cambodia, where war and civil
unrest until recently inhibited
development. With peace have
come new threats from  commer-
cial loggers who have already
exhausted forests in Thailand and
peninsular Malaysia - where har-
vest and import restrictions now
encourage logging companies to
move on to neighboring nations.

Most of Asia's remaining
frontier forest is confined to the
islands of Borneo, Sumatra,
Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya. Even
here, however, loggers have
exploited most accessible forests
along coasts and major rivers.
Agriculture and poorly planned
resettlement programs also take a
toll. Between 1969 and 1994,
Indonesia's transmigration pro-
gram moved 8 million people to
the nation's forested islands
where 1.7 million hectares of trop-
ical forest were soon stripped.63
More than half of Asia's last

frontiers are under moderate to
high threat, particularly from log-
ging.  An even greater long-term
worry is Asia's burgeoning popu-
lation and its ever increasing
demand for food and agricultural
land. Between 1990 and 1995
alone, the region's largely rural
population grew by more than
270 million people. The world's
most densely populated region,
Asia had more than  1 person for
every hectare of land in 1995.64

Papua New Guinea (PNG)

still possesses large areas of intact
tropical forest - 40 percent of its
original forest. Along with neigh-
boring Irian Jaya, PNG is consid-
ered a global "biodiversity hotspot."
The country probably contains at
least 5 percent of the world's
species within less than 1 percent of
its land area.72

About 85 percent of PNG's
frontier forests are under moder-
ate or high threat, primarily  from
logging, agricultural clearing, and
mining. One legacy of large clear-
felling operations is soil erosion.
Sediment washed by rivers to the
sea threatens PNG's species-rich
coral reefs and coastal fisheries.

A high percentage of

Australia's native species live
nowhere else on Earth, and much
of this biodiversity resides within
the nation's forests. To date, the
continent has lost more than 80
percent of its original frontier
forest, including large areas of
species-rich, unique forest types.
Three-fourths of Australia's tropi-
cal rainforest, for example, has
been cleared since the late 1700s.68
Australia's remaining fron-
tier forests are confined largely to
Tasmania, Cape York, and the
northwestern region.69 Grazing by
feral and domestic animals poses
a major threat, and fire manage-
ment practices are also a major
concern in some areas.  Logging's
toll within many non-frontier
areas is a serious problem.
Temperate rainforests, now largely
fragmented,  are still cut in
Tasmania and southeastern
Australia -  fodder for woodchips
for export to Japan, which con-
verts them into paper, packaging
materials, and other products.70-71

THREATENED  FRONTIERS INCLUDE:

Frontier:
1.  CENTRAL  NORTH  ISLAND
(KAWEKA/RUAHINE  RANGE)
Forest type:  Temperate
Geographic location:  New
Zealand
Threat:  Introduced species
(Australian brush-tailed possum
and feral horses)
At risk:  A high concentration of
indigenous species, as well as a
globally unique forest ecosystem
with great biodiversity, recre-
ational, and scenic value.

Threats: Logging and pipeline
development. (A large oilfield has
been discovered about 180 miles
inland.)
At risk:  A vast tract of relatively
undisturbed tropical forest of
exceptionally high species rich-
ness. Homelands for several
groups of indigenous people.

A high percentage of
Australia's  native
species live nowhere

else on Earth.

OCEANIA  (PAPUA  NEW
GUINEA,  AUSTRALIA,  AND
NEW  ZEALAND):

Oceania has lost almost 80

percent of its frontier  forests.
About three quarters of what
remains is under moderate or
high threat. Within the region, the
status of forests varies greatly by
country and forest type.

New Zealand has lost the

highest percentage of frontier  for-
est: less than 10 percent of its orig-
inal forest cover remains as a
frontier. Colonized by the Maori
about a thousand years ago, these
forests were the last of the world's
large land areas to be settled by
humans, but clearing for agricul-
ture has destroyed about two
thirds of all frontier forests since
that date, and another 5 percent
or so has been converted to plan-
tations. Although most of New
Zealand's remaining frontiers are
legally protected, all are threat-
ened by introduced species, such
as the Australian brush-tailed
possum, which are taking a
heavy toll on the nation's  endemic
flora.66'67

T HE  C L O S I NG  F R O N T I E R:  A  CALL  TO  A C T I ON

The news is not all
bad. The opportunity
to protect a priceless
natural inheritance
for ourselves and
future generations is

still ours.

T his assessment found that

few large intact forest
ecosystems are left on the
planet, and that many of these last
frontiers  are threatened by logging,
agricultural clearing, and other
activities. But the news is not all
bad: even after thousands of years
of forest clearing and degradation,
some frontier forests remain. The
opportunity to protect a priceless
natural inheritance for ourselves
and future generations is still ours.
But this assessment also sug-

gests that unless we take action
quickly, this opportunity is likely to
pass. Against a backdrop of popu-
lation growth and mounting
human needs, preventing  further
frontier  losses will require a new
and balanced approach to forest
management - one that protects
forests' biodiversity and other
assets while simultaneously pro-
viding for people and ecosystem
services.

Stewardship Options for Managing Frontier Forests

SUSTAINABLE  FOREST  PRACTICES

FRONTIER  FOREST  BOUNDARY

OPTION  ONE

Maintain the entire frontier  forest as a protected park or reserve.
Develop sustainable land-use practices in surrounding non-frontier  forest so that
this forest serves as a buffer  zone.
Retain biodiversity, carbon balances, and watershed quality as they are now.

OPTION  TWO

i Establish protected areas where needed within large portions of the  frontier

forest to preserve biodiversity.

I Connect these areas with corridors or bridges of land that remain in natural,

intact forest.

I Introduce sustainable forest-use practices in the remaining frontier  forest,

whether timber extraction, hunting, tourism and ecotourism,  fishing,
bioprospecting, or the gathering of traditional medicinal and ritual items of
value to local communities.
Ensure the maintenance of biodiversity, retention of carbon, and watershed
protection.

RESTORIN

G  FRONTIER  FOREST:  THE  GUANACASTE  EXAMPLE

Even a degraded and frag-

mented once-frontier  forest invaded
by exotic species may not necessarily
be gone forever: scientists practicing
restoration ecology are developing
techniques to regrow native forests.

One of the world's most

ambitious -  and thus far successful
-  forest restoration efforts is in north-
western Costa Rica, where local,
national, and international
researchers are together restoring a

large tract of tropical dry forest in
Guanacaste Conservation Area.73
Launched in the mid-1980s,

the project features a three-pronged
approach.

First, participants kicked off
an aggressive fire-control program
to stop human-caused fires, which
were encouraging the growth of
exotic grasses in cleared forest areas
and killing native seedlings.  Once
fires were stopped, scientists allowed

wind and animals to carry in native
tree seeds from an adjacent national
park, helping nature when there was
money by planting typical species in
appropriate places and combinations.
They brought in cattle to help
control the grasses.

Today, the incidence of fire in
Guanacaste is down 90 percent, and
the introduced grass, jaragua, is vir-
tually gone from the area. Thickets
of 10- to 15-foot native trees now

dominate the landscape. Within 20
to 50 years, researchers expect the
canopy to close, killing off all
remaining jaragua and stopping set
fires completely. They also hope
that by then the forest will house
viable populations of all the plant
and animal species that once
inhabited the area.74

A stewardship approach to

forest management would
achieve such badly needed bal-
ance. (See Box 5)  Such an
approach should, in fact, be
applied to all of the world's forests
because non-frontier  forests also
provide humans with a range of
important functions  and many
are high conservation priorities.
Stewardship will mean pursuing
different  options in different  parts
of the world.  Where few large,
intact forest ecosystems remain
-  in temperate regions, for
example -  frontier  forests should
be largely protected in parks or
reserves.  Where human needs
are pressing and where very large
tracts of frontier  forest remain,

careful development is still an
option if ecologically viable core
areas of forest are protected and
surrounding lands managed
sustainably. (See Figure  7)
Activities such as logging should
cause minimal environmental
damage and return maximum
economic benefits to local people.
Figure 7 illustrates how various
development activities can be
balanced.

How much frontier  forest

does the world need?  At a mini-
mum, we must maintain repre-
sentative samples of all types of
forest ecosystems. There are no
substitutes for living examples of
how each system functions or for
refuges for most of the world's
forest species.

As "insurance," we recom-

mend that nations:

  Maintain more than one tract

of each ecosystem type.

  Protect frontiers even when

neighboring countries maintain
ecologically similar forests.

  Manage land outside protected
areas in ways that protect the
ecological integrity of forest
frontiers; and

  Try to restore fragmented  and
degraded forests. (See Box  4.)

If forest management is to
reflect the needs of all,  successful
stewardship must include the
active participation of these and
other stakeholders.

NATIONAL  AND  LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS:

Government policies must
promote economic development
without  destroying the resource
base and the environmental ser-
vices provided by forests.
Specifically, they should:

 

Immediately halt further loss
of frontier  forests and restore
degraded forests;

  Expand and better manage

protected area systems;
  Create incentives for the
private sector to manage
frontier  forests sustainably;

  Monitor forest quality to

measure the success of
management programs; and
  Encourage stewardship and

educate the public about
frontier  forests.

 

A NEW

Forest management based on

stewardship should include:

  Collecting all relevant informa-
tion on forests and how they are
being used and making it readily
available to anyone with a stake in
forests;
  Managing forests for long-term
economic and other benefits and
involving stakeholders and the pub-
lic in forest-management decisions;

VISION  OF  FRONTIER  FOREST  STEWARDSHIP
  Charging fees for using public
forest lands and returning revenues
to both the nation and local
communities;
  Designing and enforcing fee
regulations that discourage corrup-
tion and wasteful use of forests for
short-term gain;
  Developing balanced land-use
plans that set aside portions of
forests for tourism, biodiversity con-
servation, and watershed protection;

  Attracting investors interested in
using forests sustainably and mak-
ing their continued access to forests
contingent upon their environmen-
tal and social record;
 
for government in all large-scale
forest development plans -  includ-
ing authority to ensure equitable
distribution of revenues and long-
term ecosystem viability;

Including an unambiguous role

  Developing capacity in public,
private, or non-governmental forest
agencies to plan, negotiate, imple-
ment, monitor, and enforce forest-
management agreements; and
  Setting aside and conserving
special forested areas in well-delin-
eated national parks, indigenous
reserves, or other protected areas.

NATIONAL  AND  INTERNATIONAL
DONOR  ORGANIZATIONS:

To promote the survival of

global treasures that also provide
significant environmental
benefits -  including carbon
storage and biodiversity
protection, donors should:

 

Increase support for  forest-rich
countries, particularly
neglected ones;

  Coordinate efforts  among

donors to maximize impact;

  Form partnerships among

organizations -  including the
private sector -  working
toward forest stewardship; and
  Support projects that promote

both conservation and the
sustainable use of frontier
forests.

BUSINESS  AND THE PRIVATE
SECTOR:

Traditionally viewed as ene-

mies of conservation, private
industry -  from logging, mining,
and oil companies to trade and
retail industries -  can become an
agent of sound forest management
if it is willing to protect jobs and
cultivate long-term profits by:

  Working with non-

governmental organizations,
governments, and others to
develop markets for products
from well-managed forests;

  Avoiding investments in
projects that degrade or
destroy frontier  forests; and
  Lobbying and encouraging
governments to try policies
that promote forest
stewardship.

CITIZENS:

As voters and consumers

partly responsible for the fate of
the world's last large intact forests,
citizens should:

  Ensure that decision-makers

manage forests with the  general
public's needs in mind (at least
in countries where citizens
have voting power and can
directly influence their leaders);

  Keep informed about policy

issues affecting  frontier  forests;
and

  Voice their concerns -  through

protests and boycotts, if
necessary -  when governments
mismanage these forests.

Especially within wealthy
countries, consumers can create
demand for products that come
from well-managed forests if they:

  Purchase only wood, paper,

and other forest products that
are independently certified as
sustainably harvested;75

  Demand that retailers make
such products available; and
  Reduce pressure on frontier

forests by recycling and limiting
consumption -  not only of
wood and paper, but also of
energy and mineral resources
from forested regions.

FRONTIER  PEOPLES:

People who live within and

near the world's last frontier
forests stand to lose the most if
these ecosystems are destroyed.
Managing forests for non-timber
products, ecotourism, or even sus-
tainable logging and other
resource extraction could both
protect these forests and provide
local income now and for  future

generations. As on-the-spot forest
stewards, local populations should
demand that the government and
private sector provide opportunities
for long-term economic and cul-
tural security without environ-
mental destruction.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL
ORGANIZATIONS, 
ADVOCACY  GROUPS:

INCLUDING

Non-governmental organiza-
tions (NGOs) can mobilize critical
support for conservation and
stewardship. Information is one of
their most powerful tools. By
assessing and monitoring forest
health and use,  for example,
NGOs can uncover evidence that
governments, private industry, or
others are mismanaging forests  -
or for that matter, doing their
jobs. These organizations also
should collect and disseminate
information on forest stewardship
in practice. Given limited time and
financial resources, NGOs must
coordinate their efforts and form
partnerships with government
agencies and private businesses.

aside for permanent production,
primarily of mahogany and cedar.
After negotiating with logging
companies, participants -  3,000 as of
1991 ~ began to process logs, which
adds value to their product and
brings communities more income
than shipping out raw timber does.

Before ejidos managed  the

forest, local communities derived no
benefits from logging operations.
Now, participants are working to
maintain the natural forest by
cutting trees on a 25-year cycle,
allowing native species to regenerate,
and increasing the proportion of

mahogany and cedar  through
enrichment planting. After eight
years, communities already are seeing
good regeneration of natural  forest
-  along with an income, an incentive
to keep up the good  work.78

METHODOLOGY:

CURRENT FOREST COVER:

WRI used the only existing
global map of current forest cover
-  that produced by the World
Conservation Monitoring Centre
(WCMC) in 1996, in collaboration
with the World Wildlife Fund and
CIFOR -  as a base coverage for
this assessment.  The sources for
this map include many country
and regional maps derived from
national and international
sources, mostly accurate to a
1:1,000,000 scale. (All coverages
used in the Frontier Forest
Assessment were degraded to a
1:8,000,000 scale.)  The quality,
accuracy and dates of these
national and regional maps vary.
For details, please refer to:

The World Conservation
Monitoring Centre, The World
Forest Map,  (WCMC, Cambridge,
1996).

MAPPING OF FRONTIER FOREST AREAS:

The frontier  forest maps
within this report reflect the
knowledge and input of more
than 90 experts and reviewers
from around the world.  Work on
the Last Frontier Forests assess-
ment began in May 1996, when
WRI hosted meetings and review
sessions (in Washington,
Cambridge, U.K, and Rome) at
which outside experts were asked
to help define frontier areas and
propose a methodology for map-
ping them.  Mapping itself was a
three-step process:

1.  WRI first developed regional
maps of "candidate frontier areas"
by overlaying -  using a
Geographic information System
(GIS) -  the World Conservation
Monitoring Centre's current closed
forest cover map with Sierra
Club's "wilderness areas" map79
to define large wooded blocks
devoid of human  infrastructure
(roads, settlements, etc.) where
near-pristine forest might be
found;

2.  Approximately 90 regional
forest experts were then asked to
annotate these maps.  Ten to fif-
teen individuals per region with
broad knowledge of forest extent
and condition reviewed the maps
of candidate frontier  areas and,
using a checklist survey, either:
(i.) nominated candidate sites as
"frontier  forests"; (ii.) redefined
the boundaries of candidate sites
or (iii.) rejected candidate sites,
and;

3.  WRI digitized the revised
boundaries of these areas.

Experts were also asked to
fill in a questionnaire for each
frontier area assessed.  This survey
was used to build a database for
each frontier site, which includes
information on:

I. Forest type (based on survey
results).  Experts were asked to
classify frontiers according to one
or more of the following cate-
gories: "boreal," "temperate hard-
wood," "temperate mixed conifer-
ous and deciduous forest," "south-
ern temperate/astral forest,"
"humid tropical forest,"  "dry trop-
ical forest."

II. Size (this was calculated using
a GIS).  WRI also asked experts to
roughly estimate the size of each
frontier assessed, where known.

III. Threats to ecosystem integrity
(based on information  contained
within the questionnaires).
Experts were asked to rank sites
as under high, medium, or low
threat from "commercial logging,"
"other biomass harvest (removal
of fuelwood and construction
materials, grazing)," "forest clear-
ing (for agriculture, residential
housing etc)," "road construction
and other  infrastructure
development (e.g. powerlines,
pipelines)," and "other," and to
provide additional details on
known threats.

iv. Potential threats to ecosystem
integrity (also based on information
from the questionnaires).  Experts
were asked to: (i.) note where
significant portions of a  frontier
site have been allocated for current
or future harvest (e.g. zoned as
production forest, given over to
concessions) and to estimate the
percentage of each site allocated
for harvest, where known; and
(ii.) indicate if a site contains
high-value timber species, or
other high-value resources (e.g.
gold, oil), and to estimate the
approximate proportion of the site
within which such resources
occur.

v. Source of expert  information
and level of knowledge (for most
sites, based on the input of several
reviewers).  The names of these
individuals are listed within WRI's
database, along with a ranking of
how well these experts claim to
know each frontier  area (experts
were asked to rank themselves on
a 1-5 scale according to how well
they know a given site).

In many cases, sites were

nominated and reviewed indepen-
dently by several experts.  WRI
harmonized these results by: (i.)
consulting with reviewers when
their results differed  for a given
site to come up with a consensus
view; (ii.) in some cases, giving
extra weight to results from
individuals who ranked their
knowledge of a site as significantly
higher than that of others who
reviewed that frontier  forest.

WRI also held three review
sessions (one covering temperate
and boreal regions, a second cov-
ering tropical frontiers, and a
third to review all areas of the
world) to help fill in data gaps
and to solicit input on draft  fron-
tier maps.  Approximately 60
ecologists, foresters, and others
with broad knowledge of forest
issues across various regions of
the globe attended these sessions.

Note that five frontier  forest

sites within Western Zaire were
identified using maps of current
road and forest cover (the latter
derived from recent satellite
imagery).  These sites -  lacking
roads, or significant areas of
degraded forest - were added
because experts working on the
WRI study suggested forest in this
region qualified as  "frontier,"
however they were not  sufficiently
familiar with the area to identify
the boundaries of these sites.

MAPPING OF ORIGINAL FOREST COVER:

As part of this project,

WCMC developed the first detailed
map of estimated forest cover
"prior to the impact of modern
man" (circa 8,000 years ago),
using many global and regional
biogeographic maps.  These
included World Map  of  Present
Day Landscapes  (Moscow State
University/UNEP), Ecoregions  of
Latin America  and  the
Caribbean  (Dinerstein et al.),
Vegetation of Africa  (White),
Review  of the 
Indomalayan
Protected Areas  (MacKinnon),
Australia  Natural  Vegetation
(Australian Surveying and Land
Information  Group), and  General
Map  of Natural  Vegetation for
Europe  (Bohn and Katenina).
WRI adjusted this map -  notably
by using current forest cover in
the northernmost 200 km of forest
as a surrogate for historic cover so
as to capture the natural patchy
distribution of forest in this
tundra-forest  transition zone.

(Rationale:  If frontiers  are
supposed to serve as forest  refugia
during the next extinction crises,
they must be large enough to
maintain their resident species in
the face of periodic natural distur-
bance.  The "once in a century"
cutoff, although arbitrary, is a
yardstick used by engineers and
others in designing bridges, build-
ings, dams etc. that can weather
catastrophic natural events.)

3. Exhibit a structure and compo-
sition shaped largely by natural
events, as well as by limited
human disturbance from tradi-
tional activities (such as shifting
cultivation).

4.  Be relatively unmanaged  (nat-
ural disturbance regimes such as
fire are permitted to occur across
most of the area in question).

Forested areas must meet all
of the following 7 criteria to qualify
as frontiers.  They must:

1.  Be of sufficient  size to support
ecologically viable populations of
the largest carnivores and herbi-
vores associated with that partic-
ular forest ecosystem, although
they may not actually contain
these species.

(Rationale-, range require-

ments of umbrella species are
believed to be large enough to
provide for habitat requirements
of most other species within a
given ecosystem).

2.  Be of sufficient size to support
ecologically viable populations of
these species in the face of a
major natural disturbance episode
such as one would predict to
occur once in a century, within
the ecosystem in question (fire,
hurricanes, pests & disease, etc.).

The WCMC map is an indi-

cator, not a direct measure of
original cover.  It depicts where
forest might be expected to occur
today in the absence of humans,
based on climate, topography,
and other variables. The distribu-
tion of forest cover 8,000 years
ago probably varied somewhat
from region to region, due to
long-term climate change. For
details on the original forest cover
mapping methodology, please
refer to:

Kapos, Mary Edwards, Simon
Blyth and Susan Iremonger,
Estimated  Original  Forest Cover
Map  -A  First Attempt (WCMC,
Cambridge, UK, October 1996).

FRONTIER FOREST INDEX:

The frontier  forest index

ranks countries on a scale of 0 to
99.  The index was created by
multiplying the percentage of
original frontier  forest lost (that
estimated to cover the country
8,000 years ago) with the per-
centage of remaining frontier  for-
est area classified under moderate
or high threat to total assessed
frontier  area.

DEFINITIONS:

CURRENT FOREST COVER: estimated
closed forest cover within the last
10 years or so (this date varies by
country).  Only closed moist forest
is depicted for tropical Africa  and
Asia.  Woodlands and shrublands
are not included in this category.
ORIGINAL FOREST COVER: is the esti-
mated extent of closed forest
about 8,000 years ago, assuming
current climatic conditions.
FRONTIER FORESTS: are defined as
being primarily forested; of suffi-
cient size to support viable popu-
lations of the full range of indige-
nous species associated with that
particular forest ecosystem given
periodic natural disturbance
episodes (fire, hurricanes, pests &
disease, etc.), (note that this
implies that frontier  forests pro-
vide habitat for these species, not
that they actually contain these
species); and exhibiting a struc-
ture and composition shaped
largely by natural events, as well
as by limited human  disturbance
from traditional activities (such as
shifting cultivation). De facto they
are relatively unmanaged  (natural
disturbance regimes such as fire
are permitted to occur), are home
to most if not all of the species
associated with that ecosystem
type, are dominated by indige-
nous tree species associated with
that ecosystem type, and are
characterized by mosaics of forest
patches representing a range of
serai stages, in areas where such
landscape heterogeneity would be
expected to occur under natural

FOREST  FRONTIERS 

INITIATIVE

  Comparability of results has
been effected by expert bias.  Map
reviewers varied in how strictly or
loosely they have applied our
criteria in defining sites and how
they assessed the magnitude of
any given threat.  As noted above,
WRI attempted to minimize this
bias by seeking input from at least
10-15 experts for any one part of
the world (to cross-check on and
harmonize results), and by seek-
ing extensive outside review of the
draft maps to insure that data are
relatively comparable between
regions.

WRI would welcome any
comments on the accuracy of
these results and suggestions on
how we might improve on the
base maps during the next phase
of this research project.

5.  Be characterized by mosaics of
forest patches representing a
range of serai stages, in areas
where such landscape hetero-
geneity would be expected to
occur under natural conditions.

6.  Be home to most if not all of
the species associated with that
ecosystem type.

7.  Be dominated by indigenous
tree species associated with that
ecosystem type.

Many temperate frontier
forests do not strictly qualify
according to all seven criteria,
primarily due to size constraints
and to fire suppression and other
management.  For example,
Clayquot Sound in British
Columbia may be too small to
qualify as a frontier forest, and all
sites in Scandinavia may be too
disturbed to meet WRI criteria.
After consultation with temperate
experts we decided to include
those temperate areas:( i). that
are large enough to maintain
ecologically viable populations of
indigenous species when the
surrounding non-frontier  forest
matrix is

considered; and: (ii.) where fires
are generally allowed to burn
across at least half of the frontier
site (although fire suppression
may have been practiced in the
past).  Most temperate sites in
North America and Europe consist
of a mix of old growth and sec-
ondary forest.  Frontier sites that
would not otherwise qualify using
a strict interpretation of the WRI
criteria are automatically listed as
threatened due to lack of buffering
capacity and disturbance of
surrounding forest.

THREATENED FRONTIER FORESTS: are
areas assessed by experts as under
"medium" or "high" threat, where
ongoing or planned human activ-
ities will likely result in the eventual
violation of one of the seven
frontier forest criteria listed above
(e.g. cause declines in or local
extinctions of plants and animals
or large-scale changes in the
forest's age and structure). In
some cases, sites listed as threat-
ened are currently undisturbed but
are slated for logging or other
development activity, likely to
affect the ecosystem integrity of
the forest.  Note that many
threatened frontier forests include
large areas of protected forest.
While the core areas of these sites
may be undisturbed, these fron-
tiers are considered threatened
because human activity in
surrounding forest is likely to
impact the integrity of the
ecosystem as a whole.

DATA  CAVEATS AND
LIMITATIONS

This assessment represents a

rough, first-cut attempt to esti-
mate the status of global frontier
areas, and should be viewed as a
work in progress. The maps and
data contained within this report
are not intended to be used to
define conservation or investment
priorities, or to otherwise provide
input into regional or national
planning and assessment activities.
WRI will work with data partners
over coming years to improve on
the base maps and the accuracy
of these results.  Readers should
note that:

  Data availability and quality
varies between regions.  For
example, frontier forest is likely
underestimated in Central Zaire
and possibly portions of Brazil,
due to the fact that few scientists
have explored that region (and
therefore that the status of these
forests is relatively unknown).

  Naturally-fragmented  forest
ecosystems, such as areas of
montane forest cover found in
portions of East Africa, do not
register as frontier forest in this
study due to their small size.
However, in some cases these
areas may fully qualify as intact,
relatively undisturbed natural
forests.

NOTES

10  Calculated by multiplying regional
frontier  forest area by per hectare carbon
estimates for forest areas, presented in R.K.
Dixon, S. Brown, R.A. Houghton, A.M.
Solomon, M.C. Trexler and J. Wisniewski,
"Carbon Pools and Flux of Global Forest
Ecosystems." Science, Vol. 263:185-90.
Dixon et al's estimates are for closed and
open forests for both soil and above-ground
vegetation.  For this reason, and because
these averages include degraded forest
(which contains less carbon than intact
forest) the figure presented in the text on
total carbon stored in frontier forest is likely
an underestimate.  Soil carbon  figures
include peat. We used averaged per hectare
carbon figures in estimating carbon stored
in frontier  forests that contain more than
one dominant forest type (e.g. temperate
and boreal forest).

19  This study was limited to mapping
frontier  forests within closed forest ecosys-

ural tracts of woodland area (more open
forest, generally located in drier regions of
the world, between closed forest and
savannah), because no global map exists
depicting wooded areas of the world.

T he Forest Frontiers Initiative (FFI) is a five year,  multi-disciplinary

effort to promote stewardship in and around the world's last
major frontier  forests by influencing investment, policy, and public
opinion. The FFI team is working with governments, citizens' groups, and
the private sector in Amazonia, Central Africa, Indonesia, North America,
and Russia.  We also take part in pressing international discussions on
forest policy.

We are motivated by the belief that there is a responsible way to
use forests.  We also see growing interest in finding alternatives to forest
destruction that take advantage of the full economic potential of forests,
not just immediate revenue from logging and clearing.

Business has a leading role to play.  We are developing case studies
with innovative firms to demonstrate to others the business impacts and
opportunities that sustainability presents.  We are also working to
strengthen the Forest Stewardship Council, which promotes consumer
awareness about products from well-managed forests by certifying wood
products from them.

For each frontier forest region, FFI builds a network of policy-makers,

activists, investors, and researchers to promote policy reform.  Efforts to
minimize the negative impacts of road-building and forest-clearing  for
agriculture, and to stop illegal logging, are part of this work.

To spark policy change and stimulate stewardship more generally,
we will collect and disseminate more information  as it becomes available.
We are also working to build the capacity of local non-governmental
groups to do the same.
