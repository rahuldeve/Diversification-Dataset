ment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Depart-
ment  of  Energy,  to  prescribe  military  personnel  strengths  for  such  fiscal  year, 
and for other purposes. 

Be  it  enacted  by  the  Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of 

the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

(a)  SHORT TITLE.This  Act  may  be  cited  as  the  Carl  Levin 
and Howard P. Buck McKeon National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2015. 

(b) FINDINGS.Congress makes the following findings: 

(1)(A)  Senator  Carl  Levin  of  Michigan  was  elected  a 
member  of  the  United  States  Senate  on  November  7,  1978, 
for  a  full  term  beginning  January  3,  1979.  He  has  served 
continuously in the Senate since that date, and was appointed 
as  a  member  of  the  Committee  on  Armed  Services  in  January 
1979.  He  has  served  on  the  Committee  on  Armed  Services 
since that date, a period of nearly 36 years. 

(B)  A  graduate  of  Detroit  Central  High  School,  Senator 
Levin  went  on  to  Swarthmore  College,  and  graduated  from 
Harvard  Law  School  in  1959,  gaining  admittance  to  the 
Michigan bar. He served his State as assistant attorney general 
and  general  counsel  of  the  Michigan  Civil  Rights  Commission 
from  19641967,  and  later  served  his  hometown  of  Detroit 
as  a  member  of  the  Detroit  City  Council  from  19691973, 
and as the councils president from 19741977. 

(C)  Senator  Levin  first  served  as  chairman  of  the  Com-
mittee  on  Armed  Services  of  the  United  States  Senate  for 
a  period  of  the  107th  Congress,  and  has  remained  chairman 
since  the  110th  Congress  began  in  2007.  He  has  exercised 
extraordinary  leadership  as  either  the  chairman  or  ranking 
minority member of the committee since the start of the 105th 
Congress in 1997. 

(D)  Each  year,  for  the  past  52  years,  the  Committee  on 
Armed  Services  has  reliably  passed  an  annual  defense 
authorization act, and this will be the 36th that Senator Levin 
has had a role in. In his capacity as member, ranking member, 
and  chairman,  he  has  been  an  advocate  for  a  strong  national 
defense,  and  has  made  lasting  contributions  to  the  security 
of our Nation. 

(E)  It  is  altogether  fitting  and  proper  that  this  Act,  the 
last  annual  authorization  act  for  the  national  defense  that 
Senator  Levin  manages  in  and  for  the  United  States  Senate 

H. R. 39792 

as  chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Armed  Services,  be  named 
in his honor, as provided in subsection (a). 

(2)(A)  Representative  Howard  P.  Buck  McKeon  was 
elected  to  the  House  of  Representatives  in  1992  to  represent 
Californias 25th Congressional District. 

(B)  Chairman  McKeon  was  born  in  Los  Angeles  and  grew 
up  in  Tujunga  CA.  He  served  a  two  and  a  half  year  mission 
for  the  Church  of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter-Day  Saints  and 
attended  Brigham  Young  University.  Prior  to  his  election  to 
Congress,  he  was  a  small  business  owner,  and  served  both 
on  the  William  S.  Hart  Union  High  School  District  Board 
of Trustees and as the first mayor of the City of Santa Clarita. 
(C) In the 111th Congress, Chairman McKeon was selected 
by  his  peers  as  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  House  Armed 
Services  Committee  and  has  served  as  Chairman  since  in  the 
112th  and  113th  Congresses.  Previously  Chairman  McKeon 
had  served  as  the  Chairman  of  the  House  Committee  on  Edu-
cation and the Workforce. 

(D)  Chairman  McKeon  is  a  champion  of  a  strong  national 
defense,  the  men  and  women  of  Americas  Armed  Forces  and 
their families, and returning fiscal discipline to the Department 
of Defense. His priority has been to ensure our troops deployed 
around  the  world  have  the  equipment,  resources,  authorities, 
training  and  time  they  need  to  successfully  complete  their 
missions and return home. 

(E)  For  52  consecutive  years,  the  House  Armed  Services 
Committee,  in  a  bipartisan,  bicameral  tradition,  has  passed 
and  enacted  an  annual  defense  authorization  act.  Chairman 
McKeon had said it has been the privilege of his life to shepherd 
that tradition under his tenure. 

(F) It is therefore fitting this Act, the last national defense 
authorization  act  of  his  tenure,  be  named  in  Chairman 
McKeons honor, as provided in subsection (a). 
(c)  REFERENCES.Any  reference  in  this  or  any  other  Act  to 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 shall 
be deemed to refer to the Carl Levin and Howard P. Buck McKeon 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015.

completion  of  a  cost  analysis  performed  by  the  Director  of 
Cost  Assessment  and  Program  Evaluation  for  the  purpose  of 
section  2334(e)(1)  of  this  title,  and  that  the  analysis  supports

section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically 
authorized  by  law  to  be  carried  out  using  multiyear  contract

H. R. 3979140 

be  met  by  such  contract  and  has  provided  the  basis  for  such 
determination to the congressional defense committees.

was  made  after  completion  of  a  cost  analysis  conducted  on 
the  basis  of  section  2334(e)(2)  of  this  title,  and  the  analysis 
supports the determination. 

(C)  The  system  being  acquired  pursuant  to  such  contract 
has  not  been  determined  to  have  experienced  cost  growth  in 
excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to section 
2433(d)  of  this  title  within  5  years  prior  to  the  date  the  Sec-
retary  anticipates  such  contract  (or  a  contract  for  advance 
procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for 
such contract) will be awarded. 

(D)  A  sufficient  number  of  end  items  of  the  system  being 
acquired  under  such  contract  have  been  delivered  at  or  within 
the  most  current  estimates  of  the  program  acquisition  unit 
cost  or  procurement  unit  cost  for  such  system  to  determine 
that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic. 

(E)  During  the  fiscal  year  in  which  such  contract  is  to 
be  awarded,  sufficient  funds  will  be  available  to  perform  the 
contract  in  such  fiscal  year,  and  the  future-years  defense  pro-
gram  for  such  fiscal  year  will  include  the  funding  required 
to execute the program without cancellation. 

(F) The contract is a fixed price type contract. 
(G)  The  proposed  multiyear  contract  provides  for  produc-
tion at not less than minimum economic rates given the existing 
tooling and facilities. 
(4)  If  for  any  fiscal  year  a  multiyear  contract  to  be  entered 
into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procure-
ment program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions 
established  by  law  (including  a  condition  as  to  cost  savings  to 
be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified 
other  contracts)  and  if  it  appears  (after  negotiations  with  contrac-
tors)  that  such  savings  cannot  be  achieved,  but  that  substantial 
savings  could  nevertheless  be  achieved  through  the  use  of  a 
multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the Presi-
dent may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified 
cost  savings  that  must  be  achieved  through  multiyear  contracting 
for  that  program.  Any  such  request  by  the  President  shall  include 
details about the request for a multiyear contract, including details 
about the negotiated contract terms and conditions. 

(5)(A)  The  Secretary  may  obligate  funds  for  procurement  of 
an end item under a multiyear contract for the purchase of property 
only for procurement of a complete and usable end item. 

(B)  The  Secretary  may  obligate  funds  appropriated  for  any 
fiscal  year  for  advance  procurement  under  a  contract  for  the  pur-
chase of property only for the procurement of those long-lead items 
necessary in order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete 
major  end  items  that  are  programmed  under  the  contract  to  be 
acquired  with  funds  appropriated  for  a  subsequent  fiscal  year 
(including an economic order quantity of such long-lead items when 
authorized by law). 

(6) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph 
(3)  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  one  or  more  of  the  conditions 
of  such  certification  are  not  met,  if  the  Secretary  determines  that, 
due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear con-
tract  under  this  section  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Department 

H. R. 3979141 

of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determina-
tion with the certification. 

(7)  The  Secretary  may  not  delegate  the  authority  to  make 
the  certification  under  paragraph  (3)  or  the  determination  under 
paragraph  (6)  to  an  official  below  the  level  of  Under  Secretary 
of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics..

SEC.  1015.  SENSE  OF  CONGRESS  REGARDING  SECURITY  IN  THE 

WESTERN HEMISPHERE. 

(a) FINDINGS.Congress makes the following findings: 

(1)  The  stability  and  security  of  the  Western  Hemisphere 
has  a  direct  impact  on  the  security  interests  of  the  United 
States. 

(2) Over the past decade, there has been a marked increase 
in  violence  and  instability  in  the  region  as  a  result  of  weak 
governance  and  increasingly  capable  transnational  criminal 
organizations.  These  criminal  organizations  operate  global, 
multi-billion  dollar  networks  that  traffic  narcotics,  humans, 
weapons, and bulk cash. 

(3)  Conflict  between  the  various  transnational  criminal 
organizations  for  smuggling  routes  and  territory  has  resulted 
in skyrocketing violence. According to the United Nations Office 
on  Drugs  and  Crime,  Honduras  has  the  highest  murder  rate 
in the world with 90 murders per 100,000 people. 

(4)  United  States  Northern  Command  and  United  States 
Southern  Command  are  the  lead  combatant  commands  for 
Department  of  Defense  efforts  to  combat  illicit  trafficking  in 
the Western Hemisphere. 

(5) To combat these destabilizing threats, through a variety 
of authorities, the Department of Defense advises, trains, edu-
cates,  and  equips  vetted  troops  in  the  region  to  enhance  their 
military  and  police  forces,  with  an  emphasis  on  human  rights 
and the rule of law. 

(6)  As  a  result  of  decades  of  instability  and  violence,  tens 
of thousands of unaccompanied alien children and their families 
have fled to the border between the United States and Mexico. 
In  fiscal  year  2014,  approximately  66,000  such  children  were 
apprehended crossing into the United States from Mexico. 

H. R. 3979195 

(b)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
(1)  the  Department  of  Defense  should  continue  its  efforts 
to combat transnational criminal organizations in the Western 
Hemisphere; 

(2) the Department of Defense should increase its maritime, 
aerial  and 
intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance 
capabilities  in  the  region  to  more  effectively  support  efforts 
to reduce illicit trafficking into the United States; and 

(3) enhancing the capacity of partner nations in the region 
to combat the threat posed by transnational criminal organiza-
tions  should  be  a  cornerstone  of  the  Department  of  Defenses 
strategy in the region.

SEC. 1024. SENSE OF CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF 

THE SINKING OF U.S.S. THRESHER. 

(a) FINDINGS.Congress makes the following findings: 

(1) U.S.S. Thresher was first launched at Portsmouth Naval 

Shipyard on July 9, 1960. 

(2)  U.S.S.  Thresher  departed  Portsmouth  Naval  Shipyard 
for her final voyage on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 16 officers, 
96 sailors, and 17 civilians. 

(3)  The  mix  of  that  crew  reflects  the  unity  of  the  naval 
submarine  service,  military  and  civilian,  in  the  protection  of 
the United States. 

(4)  At  approximately  7:47  a.m.  on  April  10,  1963,  while 
in  communication  with  the  surface  ship  U.S.S.  Skylark,  and 
approximately  220  miles  off  the  coast  of  New  England,  U.S.S. 
Thresher began her final descent. 

H. R. 3979197 

(5)  U.S.S.  Thresher  was  declared  lost  with  all  hands  on 

April 10, 1963. 

(6)  In  response  to  the  loss  of  U.S.S.  Thresher,  the  United 
States  Navy  instituted  new  regulations  to  ensure  the  health 
of  the  submariners  and  the  safety  of  the  submarines  of  the 
United States. 

(7)  Those  regulations  led  to  the  establishment  of  the  Sub-
marine  Safety  and  Quality  Assurance  program  (SUBSAFE), 
now  one  of  the  most  comprehensive  military  safety  programs 
in the world. 

(8)  SUBSAFE  has  kept  the  submariners  of  the  United 
States safe at sea ever since as the strongest, safest submarine 
force in history. 

(9)  Since  the  establishment  of  SUBSAFE,  no  SUBSAFE- 
certified  submarine  has  been  lost  at  sea,  which  is  a  legacy 
owed  to  the  brave  individuals  who  perished  aboard  U.S.S. 
Thresher. 

(10)  From  the  loss  of  U.S.S.  Thresher,  there  arose  in  the 
institutions of higher education in the United States the ocean 
engineering  curricula  that  enables  the  preeminence  of  the 
United States in submarine warfare. 

(11)  The  crew  of  U.S.S.  Thresher  demonstrated  the  last 
full  measure  of  devotion  in  service  to  the  United  States,  and 
this  devotion  characterizes  the  sacrifices  of  all  submariners, 
past and present. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.Congress 

(1) recognizes the 51st anniversary of the sinking of U.S.S. 

Thresher; 

(2)  remembers  with  profound  sorrow  the  loss  of  U.S.S. 
Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on April 
10, 1963; and 

(3)  expresses  its  deepest  gratitude  to  all  submariners  on 
eternal  patrol,  who  are  forever  bound  together  by  dedicated 
and honorable service to the United States of America.

ations, tactics, techniques, and procedures of the Armed Forces 
of  the  United  States,  and  is  the  single  greatest  quantitative

the harm caused by these leaks.

troller General of the United States shall submit to the congres-
sional defense committees a written briefing on the assessment 
of the Comptroller General of the Aviation Restructuring Initia-
tive  of  the  Army  and  of  any  proposals  submitted  by  the  Chief 
of  the  National  Guard  Bureau  or  the  Cost  Assessment  and 
Program  Evaluation  Office  of  the  Department  of  Defense  that 
could serve as alternatives to the Armys proposal for adjusting 
the  structure  and  mix  of  its  combat  aviation  forces  among 
regular Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard units. 
(2)  REPORT.Not  later  than  60  days  after  the  submittal 
of  the  briefing  under  paragraph  (1),  the  Comptroller  General 
shall  submit  to  the  congressional  defense  committees  a  final 
report on the assessment referred to in that paragraph. 
(b)  ELEMENTS.The  briefing  and  report  of  the  Comptroller 
General  required  by  subsection  (a)  shall  include,  at  a  minimum, 
each of the following: 

(1)  A  comparison  of  the  assumptions  on  strategy,  current 
demands, historical readiness rates, anticipated combat require-
ments,  and  the  constraints  and  limitations  associated  with 
mobilization,  utilization,  and  rotation  policies  underlying  the 
Aviation Restructuring Initiative and any alternatives proposed 
by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Department 
of  Defense  Cost  Assessment  and  Program  Evaluation  Office. 
(2)  An  assessment  of  the  models  used  to  estimate  future 
costs  and  cost  savings  associated  with  each  proposal  for  allo-
cating Army aviation platforms among the regular Army, Army 
Reserve, and Army National Guard units. 

(3)  A  comparison  of  the  military  and  civilian  personnel 
requirements  for  supporting  combat  aviation  brigades  under 
each proposal, including a description of the anticipated require-
ments  and  funding  allocated  for  active  Guard  Reserve  and 
full-time  military  technicians  supporting  the  Army  National 
Guard AH64 Apache units. 
(c)  SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR 
THE ARMY.Congress  is  concerned  with  the  planned  reductions 
and  realignments  the  Army  has  proposed  for  the  regular  Army, 
the  Army  National  Guard,  and  the  Army  Reserves  in  order  to 
comply  with  the  funding  constraints  under  the  Budget  Control 
Act  of  2011  (Public  Law  11225).  Concerns  are  particularly  associ-
ated  with  proposed  reductions  in  end  strength  for  all  components 
that  will  result  in  additional  reductions  in  the  number  of  regular 
Army and National Guard brigade combat teams as well as reduc-
tions  and  realignments  of  combat  aircraft  within  and  between  the 
regular  Army  and  the  Army  National  Guard.  Sufficient  funding

should  be  provided  to  retain  the  force  structure  and  sustain  the 
readiness  of  as  much  Total  Army  combat  capability  as  possible.

OF AFGHANISTAN. 

It is the sense of Congress that 

(1)  a  top  national  security  priority  for  the  United  States 
continues  to  be  to  support  the  stability  and  sovereignty  of 
Afghanistan  and  to  help  Afghanistan  ensure  that  its  territory 
is not used by al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, or other violent 
extremist  groups  to  launch  attacks  against  the  United  States 
or its interests; 

(2) the presence of United States military forces in Afghani-
stan  after  2014  to  train,  advise,  and  assist  the  Afghanistan 
National Security Forces (ANSF) and conduct counterterrorism 
operations  is  a  key  step  to  maintaining  the  significant  gains 
achieved  in  Afghanistan  and  should  be  executed  consistent 
with the security conditions on the ground; 

(3)  any  drawdown  of  such  United  States  military  forces 
and  operations  should  be  considered  in  relation  to  security 
conditions  on  the  ground  in  Afghanistan  at  the  time  of  the 
drawdown  and  the  recommendations  of  senior  United  States 
military commanders; and 

(4)  NATO  member  countries  and  other  members  of  the 
international  community  should  honor  their  commitments  to 
support  Afghanistan  at  the  Lisbon,  Chicago,  and  Tokyo  con-
ferences  taking  into  account  the  mutual  accountability  frame-
work agreed by the Government of Afghanistan.

(1)  It  was  the  object  and  purpose  of  the  INF  Treaty  to 
eliminate  the  production  or  deployment  of  ground  launched 
ballistic  and  cruise  missiles  with  a  range  of  between  500  and 
5,500 kilometers, which was accomplished in 1992.

Adherence  to  and  Compliance  with  Arms  Control,  Non-
proliferation,  and  Disarmament  Agreements  and  Commit-
ments  stated  that  The  United  States  has  determined  that 
the  Russian  Federation  is  in  violation  of  its  obligations  under 
the INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground- 
launched  cruise  missile  (GLCM)  with  a  range  capability  of 
500km  to  5,500km,  or  to  possess  or  produce  launchers  of  such 
missiles.. 

(3)  In  a  letter  to  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee 
dated  October  23,  2014,  General  Martin  Dempsey,  Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote these violations are a serious 
challenge  to  the  security  of  the  United  States  and  our  allies. 
These actions, particularly when placed in the broader context 
of  Russian  regional  aggression,  must  be  met  with  a  strategic 
response..

(4)  to  ensure  that  the  members  of  the  Armed  Forces  who 
operate  the  nuclear  deterrent  of  the  United  States  have  the 
training,  resources,  and  national  support  required  to  execute 
the critical national security mission of the members. 

SEC. 1653. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DETERRENCE AND DEFENSE POS-
TURE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION. 
It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that  the  United  States  reaffirms 
and  remains  committed  to  the  policies  enumerated  by  the  North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Deterrence and Defense Posture 
Review,  dated  May  20,  2012,  and  the  Wales  Summit  Declaration 
of September 2014, including the following statements: 

(1)  As  stated  in  the  Deterrence  and  Defense  Posture 

Review: 

(A)  The  greatest  responsibility  of  the  Alliance  is  to 
protect  and  defend  our  territory  and  our  populations 
against  attack,  as  set  out  in  Article  5  of  the  Washington 
Treaty.  The  Alliance  does  not  consider  any  country  to  be 
its  adversary.  However,  no  one  should  doubt  NATOs 
resolve  if  the  security  of  any  of  its  members  were  to  be 
threatened.  NATO  will  ensure  that  it  maintains  the  full 
range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against 
any  threat  to  the  safety  and  security  of  our  populations, 
wherever it should arise. Allies goal is to bolster deterrence 
as  a  core  element  of  our  collective  defense  and  contribute 
to the indivisible security of the Alliance.. 

(B) Nuclear weapons are a core component of NATOs 
overall  capabilities  for  deterrence  and  defense  alongside 
conventional  and  missile  defense  forces.  The  review  has 
shown  that  the  Alliances  nuclear  force  posture  currently 
meets  the  criteria  for  an  effective  deterrence  and  defense 
posture.. 

(C)  The  circumstances  in  which  any  use  of  nuclear 
weapons  might  have  to  be  contemplated  are  extremely 
remote.  As  long  as  nuclear  weapons  exist,  NATO  will 
remain  a  nuclear  alliance.  The  supreme  guarantee  of  the 
security  of  the  Allies  is  provided  by  the  strategic  nuclear 
forces  of  the  Alliance,  particularly  those  of  the  United 
States;  the  independent  strategic  forces  of  the  United 
Kingdom  and  France,  which  have  a  deterrent  role  of  their 
own,  contribute  to  the  overall  deterrence  and  security  of 
the Allies.. 

H. R. 3979365 

(D)  NATO  must  have  the  full  range  of  capabilities 
necessary to deter and defend against threats to the safety 
of  its  populations  and  the  security  of  its  territory,  which 
is the Alliances greatest responsibility.. 

(E) NATO is committed to maintaining an appropriate 
mix  of  nuclear,  conventional,  and  missile  defense  capabili-
ties  for  deterrence  and  defense  to  fulfill  its  commitments 
as  set  out  in  the  Strategic  Concept.  These  capabilities, 
underpinned  by  NATOs  Integrated  Command  Structure, 
offer the strongest guarantee of the Alliances security and 
will  ensure  that  it  is  able  to  respond  to  a  variety  of  chal-
lenges and unpredictable contingencies in a highly complex 
and evolving international security environment.. 
(2) As stated in the Wales Summit Declaration: 

(A)  Deterrence,  based  on  an  appropriate  mix  of 
nuclear,  conventional,  and  missile  defence  capabilities, 
remains a core element of our overall strategy.. 

(B) Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation 
continue  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  achievement 
of  the  Alliances  security  objectives.  Both  the  success  and 
failure  of  these  efforts  can  have  a  direct  impact  on  the 
threat environment of NATO. In this context, it is of para-
mount importance that disarmament and non-proliferation 
commitments  under  existing 
treaties  are  honoured, 
including  the  Intermediate-Range  Nuclear  Forces  (INF) 
Treaty, which is a crucial element of Euro-Atlantic security. 
In that regard, Allies call on Russia to preserve the viability 
of  the  INF  Treaty  through  ensuring  full  and  verifiable 
compliance..

SEC. 1662. TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS 

PRIOR TO PRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT. 

(a)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
(1)  it  is  a  high  priority  of  the  United  States  that  the 
ballistic missile defense system should work in an operationally 
effective and cost-effective manner; 

(2)  prior  to  making  final  production  decisions  for  such 
systems,  and  prior  to  the  operational  deployment  of  such  sys-
tems,  the  United  States  should  conduct  operationally  realistic 
intercept  flight  testing  that  should  create  sufficiently  chal-
lenging operational conditions to establish confidence that such 
systems will work in an operationally effective and cost-effective 
manner when needed; and 

(3)  in  order  to  achieve  these  objectives,  and  to  avoid  post- 
production  and  post-deployment  problems,  it  is  essential  for 
the  Department  of  Defense  to  follow  a  fly  before  you  buy 
approach  to  adequately  test  and  assess  the  elements  of  the 
ballistic missile defense system before final production decisions 
or operational deployment. 
(b)  SUCCESSFUL TESTING REQUIRED PRIOR TO FINAL PRODUC-
TION OR OPERATIONAL DEPLOYMENT.The Secretary of Defense may 
not  make  a  final  production  decision  for,  or  operationally  deploy, 
a covered system unless 

(ii) has the ability to accomplish the intended mis-

sion of the covered system; 

(2)  the  Director  of  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  has 
carried  out  subsection  (c)  with  respect  to  such  covered  system; 
and 

(3)  the  Commander  of  the  United  States  Strategic  Com-
mand has carried out subsection (d) with respect to such covered 
system. 
(c)  ASSESSMENT BY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONAL TEST AND 
EVALUATION.The  Director  of  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation 
shall 

(1) provide to the Secretary the assessment of the Director, 
based  on  the  available  test  data,  of  the  sufficiency,  adequacy, 
and  results  of  the  testing  of  each  covered  system,  including 
an assessment of whether the covered system will be sufficiently 
effective, suitable, and survivable when needed; and 

(2) submit to the congressional defense committees a writ-

ten summary of such assessment. 

(1) the Secretary ensures that 

(A)  sufficient  and  operationally  realistic  testing  of  the 
covered  system  is  conducted  to  assess  the  performance 
of the covered system in order to inform a final production 
decision or an operational deployment decision; and 

(B)  the  results  of  such  testing  have  demonstrated  a 

high probability that the covered system 

(i)  will  work  in  an  operationally  effective  manner; 

and 

H. R. 3979367 

(d) ASSESSMENT BY COMMANDER OF UNITED STATES STRATEGIC 
COMMAND.The  Commander  of  the  United  States  Strategic  Com-
mand shall 

(1)  provide  to  the  Secretary  a  military  utility  assessment 

of the operational utility of each covered system; and 

(2) not later than 30 days after providing such assessment 
to  the  Secretary,  submit  to  the  congressional  defense  commit-
tees a written summary of such assessment. 
(e)  RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be 
construed  to  alter,  modify,  or  otherwise  affect  a  determination  of

Agency  in  the  Joint  Capabilities  Integration  Development  System 
or  the  acquisition  reporting  process  under  the  Department  of 
Defense Directive 5000 series. 

(f)  COVERED SYSTEM.In  this  section,  the  term  covered 
system  means  a  new  or  substantially  upgraded  interceptor  or 
weapon  system  of  the  ballistic  missile  defense  system,  other  than 
the re-designed exo-atmospheric kill vehicle covered by the acquisi-
tion plan developed under section 1663. 
SEC.  1663.  ACQUISITION  PLAN  FOR  RE-DESIGNED  EXO-ATMOSPHERIC 

KILL VEHICLE. 

(a)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
(1)  the  existing  models  of  the  exo-atmospheric  kill  vehicle 
of  the  ground-based  midcourse  defense  system  are  prototype 
designs that were developed and deployed without using tradi-
tional acquisition practices in order to provide an initial defen-
sive capability for an emerging ballistic missile threat; 

(2)  consequently,  while  the  deployed  models  of  the  exo- 
atmospheric  kill  vehicle  have  demonstrated  an  initial  level 
of capability against a limited threat, such models do not have 
the  degree  of  reliability,  robustness,  cost  effectiveness,  and 
performance that are desirable; 

(3)  the  exo-atmospheric  kill  vehicle  for  the  ground-based 
midcourse  defense  system  needs  to  be  re-designed  to  substan-
tially  improve  the  performance  and  reliability  of  such  kill 
vehicles; and 

(4)  the  Secretary  of  Defense  should  follow  a  robust  and 
rigorous  acquisition  plan  for  the  design,  development,  and 
testing of the re-designed exo-atmospheric kill vehicle. 
(b)  ACQUISITION PLAN REQUIRED.The  Secretary  of  Defense 
shall  develop  an  acquisition  plan  for  the  re-design  of  the  exo- 
atmospheric  kill  vehicle  of  the  ground-based  midcourse  defense 
system  that  includes  rigorous  elements  for  system  engineering, 
design, integration, development, testing, and evaluation. 

(c)  OBJECTIVES.The  objectives  of  the  acquisition  plan  under 
subsection  (b)  shall  be  to  ensure  that  the  re-designed  exo- 
atmospheric  kill  vehicle  is  operationally  effective,  reliable,  produc-
ible, cost effective, maintainable, and testable. 

(d)  APPROVAL OF ACQUISITION PLAN REQUIRED.The  acquisi-
tion  plan  under  subsection  (b)  shall  be  subject  to  approval  by 
the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and 
Logistics. 

(e) TESTING REQUIRED.Prior to operational deployment of the

midcourse missile defense system. 

(b)  ELEMENTS.The  study  under  subsection  (a)  shall  include 

the following: 

(1) An assessment of whether the testing program described 
in  subsection  (a)  has  established,  as  of  the  date  of  the  study, 
that  the  ground-based  midcourse  missile  defense  system  has 
a high probability of performing reliably and effectively against 
limited missile threats from North Korea and Iran under real-
istic  operational  conditions,  including  an  explanation  of  the 
degree of confidence supporting such assessment. 

(2) An assessment of whether the currently planned testing 
program,  if  implemented,  is  sufficient  to  establish  reasonable 
confidence  that  the  ground-based  midcourse  missile  defense 
system has a high probability of performing reliably and effec-
tively  under  realistic  operational  conditions  against  current 
and  plausible  near-  and  medium-term  limited  ballistic  missile 
threats from North Korea and Iran. 

(3)  Any  recommendations  for  improvements  that  could  be 

made to the testing program to 

(A)  achieve  reasonable  confidence  that  the  system 
would  be  reliable  and  effective  under  realistic  operational 
conditions; or 

(B) improve test and cost efficiencies. 

(c)  REPORT.Not  later  than  one  year  after  entering  into  the

a classified annex. 
SEC.  1665.  SENSE  OF  CONGRESS  AND  REPORT  ON  HOMELAND  BAL-

LISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE. 

(a)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
(1)  it  is  a  national  priority  to  defend  the  United  States 
homeland  against  the  threat  of  limited  ballistic  missile  attack 
(whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate); 

(2)  although  the  currently  deployed  ground-based  mid-
course  defense  system  provides  a  level  of  protection  of  the 
entire  United  States  homeland,  including  the  East  Coast, 
against the threat of limited ballistic missile attack from North 

H. R. 3979369 

Korea  and  Iran,  this  capability  needs  to  be  improved  to  meet 
evolving ballistic missile threats; 

(3)  the  initial  step  in  this  process  of  improvement  is  to 
correct  the  problems  that  caused  the  flight  test  failures  with 
the  current  kill  vehicles,  and  to  improve  the  reliability  of  the 
deployed ground-based interceptor fleet; 

(4)  as  indicated  by  senior  officials  of  the  Department  of 
Defense,  continued  investments  to  enhance  homeland  defense 
sensor and discrimination capabilities are essential to improve 
the  operational  effectiveness  and  shot  doctrine  of  the  ground- 
based midcourse defense system; 

(5)  given  limitations  with  the  currently  deployed  exo- 
atmospheric  kill  vehicles,  it  is  important  to  re-design  the  exo- 
atmospheric  kill  vehicle  using  a  rigorous  acquisition  approach, 
including  realistic  testing,  that  can  achieve  a  demonstrated 
capability  as  soon  as  practicable  using  sound  acquisition  prin-
ciples and practices; and 

(6)  in  order  to  stay  ahead  of  evolving  ballistic  missile 
threats,  the  Department  should  design  the  next  generation 
exo-atmospheric  kill  vehicle  to  take  full  advantage  of  improve-
ments 
in  sensors,  discrimination,  kill  assessment,  battle 
management, and command and control, including the potential 
to engage multiple objects.

SEC. 3112. PLUTONIUM PIT PRODUCTION CAPACITY. 

(a)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
(1) the requirement to create a modern, responsive nuclear 
infrastructure  that  includes  the  capability  and  capacity  to 
produce,  at  minimum,  50  to  80  pits  per  year,  is  a  national 
security priority; 

(2) delaying creation of a modern, responsive nuclear infra-
structure until the 2030s is an unacceptable risk to the nuclear 
deterrent  and  the  national  security  of  the  United  States;  and 
(3)  timelines  for  creating  certain  capacities  for  production 
of plutonium pits and other nuclear weapons components must 
be  driven  by  the  requirement  to  hedge  against  technical  and 

nium pits; 

plutonium pits; 

plutonium pits; 

plutonium pits; and 

(2)  during  2024,  produces  not  less  than  10  war  reserve 

(3)  during  2025,  produces  not  less  than  20  war  reserve 

(4)  during  2026,  produces  not  less  than  30  war  reserve

(B) is owned and operated by

SEC.  3503.  SENSE  OF  CONGRESS  ON  THE  ROLE  OF  DOMESTIC  MARI-

TIME INDUSTRY IN NATIONAL SECURITY. 

(a) FINDINGS.Congress finds that 

(1)  the  United  States  domestic  maritime  industry  carries 
hundreds  of  million  of  tons  of  cargo  annually,  supports  nearly 
500,000 jobs, and provides nearly 100 billion in annual economic 
output; 

H. R. 3979614 

(2)  the  Nations  military  sealift  capacity  will  benefit  from 
one  of  the  fastest  growing  segments  of  the  domestic  trades, 
14  domestic  trade  tankers  that  are  on  order  to  be  constructed 
at United States shipyards as of February 1, 2014; 

(3) the domestic trades vessel innovations that transformed 
worldwide  maritime  commerce  include  the  development  of 
containerships,  self-unloading  vessels,  articulated  tug-barges, 
trailer  barges,  chemical  parcel  tankers,  railroad-on-barge 
carfloats, and river flotilla towing systems; 

(4) the national security benefits of the domestic maritime 
industry  are  unquestioned  as  the  Department  of  Defense 
depends  on  United  States  domestic  trades  fleet  of  container 
ships,  roll-on/roll-off  ships,  and  product  tankers  to  carry  mili-
tary cargoes; 

(5)  the  Department  of  Defense  benefits  from  a  robust 
commercial  shipyard  and  ship  repair  industry  and  current 
growth  in  that  sector  is  particularly  important  as  Federal 
budget cuts may reduce the number of new constructed military 
vessels; and 

(6)  the  domestic  fleet  is  essential  to  national  security  and 
was a primary source of mariners needed to crew United States 
Government-owned sealift vessels activated from reserve status 
during  Operations  Enduring  Freedom  and  Iraqi  Freedom  in 
the period 2002 through 2010. 
(b)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
United States coastwise trade laws promote a strong domestic trade 
maritime  industry,  which  supports  the  national  security  and  eco-
nomic  vitality  of  the  United  States  and  the  efficient  operation 
of the United States transportation system.
