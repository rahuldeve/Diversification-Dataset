Summary

The 2012 wildfire season isnt over yet, but already this year is shaping up to be the one of the worst on 
record in the American West. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, with nearly two months still 
to go in the fire season, the total area already burned this year is 30 percent more than in an average year, and 
fires have consumed more than 8.6 million acres, an area larger than the state of Maryland.

The annual number of wildfires greater than 1,000 acres on 
U.S. Forest Service Land has  been increasing across the West. 

Key findings

Yet, what defines a typical wildfire year in the West is 
changing. In the past 40 years, rising spring and summer 
temperatures,  along  with  shrinking  winter  snowpack, 
have increased the risk of wildfires in most parts of the 
West.

 Studies show that continued climate change is going 
to  make  wildfires  much  more  common  in  the  coming 
decades. 

The  National  Research  Council  reports  that  for  every 
degree  Celsius  (1.8oF)  of  temperature  increase,  the  size 
of the area burned in the Western U.S. could quadruple. 
According  to  the  IPCC  4th  Assessment  Report,  summer 
temperatures  in  western  North  America  could  increase 
between  3.6oF  and  9oF  by  the  middle  of  this  century. 

Our analysis of 42 years of U.S. Forest Service records for 11 Western states shows that:

The number of large and very large fires on Forest Service land is increasingly dramatically.  Compared to 
the average year in the 1970s, in the past decade there were:

   7 times more fires greater than 10,000 acres each year
   Nearly 5 times more fires larger than 25,000 acres each year 
   Twice as many fires over 1,000 acres each year, with an average of more than 100 per year from 2002 

through 2011, compared with less than 50 during the 1970s.

In some states the increase in wildfires is even more dramatic.  Since the 1970s the average number of 
fires over 1,000 acres each year has nearly quadrupled in Arizona and Idaho, and has doubled in California, 
Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming.  

On average, wildfires burn twice as much land area each year as they did 40 years ago.  In the past decade, 
the average annual burn area on Forest Service land in the West has exceeded 2 million acres  more than 
all of Yellowstone National Park.

The burn season is two and a half months longer than in the 1970s.  Across the West, the first wildfires of 
the year are starting earlier and the last fires of the year are starting later, making typical fire years 75 days 
longer now than they were 40 years ago.

Rising  spring  and  summer  temperatures  across 
the  West  appear  to  be  correlated  to  the  increasing 
size  and  numbers  of  wildfires.  Spring  and  summer 
temperatures have increased more rapidly across this 
region than the rest of the country, in recent decades.  
Since  1970,  years  with  above-average  spring  and 
summer  temperatures  were  typically  years  with  the 
biggest wildfires. 

Previous research reveals that climatic changes, including 
increasing  temperatures  and  the  earlier  onset  of  spring 
snowmelt,  have  been 
levels  of 
atmospheric  greenhouse  gases  and  are  likely  influencing 
these damaging fire trends. As average global temperatures 
rise, researchers project that the risk of wildfires in Americas 
West will accelerate.

Wildfires larger than 10,000 acres are about seven times 
more common now than they were 40 years ago on U.S. 
Forest Service Land.

Increasing Wildfires in the Western U.S.

To study how wildfires are changing across the 
American  West,  we  analyzed  more  than  40  years 
of wildfire data from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), 
which  administers  the  majority  of  public  forested 
land  in  the  West.  Using  USFS  records  of  wildfires 
greater  than  1,000  acres  in  size  from  1970-2011,1 
we  calculated  changes  in  the  annual  number  of 
fires and the total area burned in 11 Western states: 
Arizona,  California,  Colorado, 
Idaho,  Montana, 
Nevada,  New  Mexico,  Oregon,  Utah,  Washington, 
and Wyoming. 

As  illustrated  in  Figure  1,  the  frequency  of 
wildfires  on  USFS  land  in  the  West  has  increased 
dramatically.  In  the  1970s,  across  all  USFS  land, 
there  were  on  average  fewer  than  50  fires  larger 
than 1,000 acres. In the past decade however, there 
have  been  an  average  of  100  fires  that  size  each 
year, and in four of the past 10 years, more than 125 
such fires.

There has only been one year since 1998 where 
there  were  as  few  fires  as  the  record  year  in  the 
1970s. 

The total area burned in large fires each year is 
also growing. Figure 2 shows that the annual burn 
area  in  the  West  has  more  than  doubled  in  the 
past  40  years.  In  the  1970s,  the  cumulative  burn 
area on USFS land in any given year was typically 
about 200,000 acres. Since 2000, there have been 
dramatic  year-to-year  variations,  but  some  of  the 
biggest  fire  years  have  seen  more  than  2  million 
acres burned; even years with fewer fires have seen 
total burn areas reach the 1 million-acre mark. 

The frequency of very large fires  often termed 
megafires    is  also  increasing  in  the  West.  The 
average number of annual fires larger than 10,000 
acres is now about seven times greater than it was 
in the 1970s (Figure 3) and each year the average 
number  of  fires  larger  than  25,000  acres  is  about 
five times more than it was 40 years ago (Figure 4). 

The above analysis is based on a thorough record 
of wildfires dating back to 1970, but it is limited to 
the public area monitored by the U.S. Forest Service. 
While experts generally agree that fire behavior on 
this land is representative of trends across the entire 
region,3  we  also  examined  the  extent  to  which 
wildfires have increased on all federal lands in the 
American West.2 This includes land managed by the

Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, as well as the U.S. Forest Service. 
When  all  agency  lands  are  considered,  complete 
and  reliable  records  are  limited  to  a  32-year  time 
span. Nevertheless, the larger data set shows trends 
comparable to those from the 42 years of USFS data.

Between 1980-2011, the average annual number 
of fires has more than doubled on all federal land 
(Figure  5)  and  the  total  area  burned  in  a  typical 
year has more than tripled (Figure 6) to more than 
3  million  acres.  Since  2000,  there  have  been  four 
years where more than 6 million acres burned on 
federal lands in the West, whereas the 20 years prior 
to  that  saw  only  two  years  where  total  burn  area 
exceeded 4 million acres. 

While there is a lot of variability from year to year, 
and there are (and will continue to be) years with 
small numbers of damaging wildfires, the long-term 
trend demonstrates that the average year now has 
twice as many large fires  that collectively burn 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  acres    than  40  years 
ago, and the likelihood of a particularly devastating 
fire year is growing rapidly. 

Among  the  Western  States,  Arizona,  California, 
Colorado, Idaho and Montana have seen the most 
dramatic  increases  in  wildfires  since  1970  (Figure 
7).  According  to  our  analysis,  the  average  annual 
number  of 
large  fires  has  nearly  quadrupled 
in  Arizona  and  Idaho,  and  at  least  doubled  in 
California,  Colorado,  Montana,  New  Mexico, 
Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. On the other 
hand,  the  frequency  of  fires  in  Washington  has 
remained steady.

Fire Season Is Getting Longer 

During the past 40 years, wildfires have started 
earlier in the year and have continued to burn later 
in the year, lengthening the overall burn season. 
Figure 8 illustrates the start date of the first wildfire 
each  year  on  USFS  land  and  the  start  date  of  the 
last recorded fire. The inset shows how the average 
time span between these two dates has increased 
by about 75 days since 1970. 

This analysis adds to an existing body of research 
that analyzed changes in Western wildfire trends up 
until 2003. Anthony Westerling of the University of 
California at Merced and colleagues have previously 
shown  that  in  the  mid-1980s,  trends  in  large 
wildfires (more than 1,000 acres) changed suddenly 
and markedly; fires began burning more frequently, 
raged  over  larger  areas,  lasted  longer,  and  the 
overall  length  of  the  wildfire  season  increased 
dramatically.3 With our additional consideration of 
more recent years, up to and including 2011, it is 
clear that the trend toward more and bigger fires is 
continuing.

Climatic Factors in Western  
Wildfire Trends

Increasing Temperatures

When we compared the average annual spring 
and  summer 
(March-August)  temperatures  to 
the  number  of  large  wildfires  burning  across  all 
11  Western  states,  we  observed  a  relationship 
similar to that reported by Westerling et al.;3 years 
with  higher-than-average  spring  and  summer 
temperatures  also  tended  to  be  years  with  more 
large fires (Figure 9).

Seasonal  temperatures  are  a  key  determinant 
of  annual  wildfire  risk.  Long  stretches  of  warm 
weather  in  the  spring  and  summer  dry  trees  and 

brush,  making  them  both  easier  to  ignite  and 
more  likely  to  burn.  Additionally,  warmer  spring 
temperatures  can  cause  mountain  snowpack  to 
melt earlier and, when followed by a hot summer 
that keeps moisture out of the ground, these higher 
temperatures  create  ideal  conditions  for  big  fires. 
Westerling  et  al.  primarily  attributed  the  changes 
he  observed  in  wildfires  to  warming  spring  and 
summer  temperatures  and  earlier  melting  of 
snowpacks in Western mountain ranges.3 

Average  annual 

temperatures  across 

the 
contiguous  U.S.  have  warmed  about  1.3oF  in  the 
past 100 years, but warming has been even higher 
in the West, rising 1.8oF over that same time period. 

Increasing  spring  and  summer  temperatures 
across  Western  states  since  1970  have  been 

Western Wildfires      l          5                

particularly dramatic (Figure 7). Spring has warmed 
approximately  1.9oF  and  summer  has  warmed 
about  1.6oF,  with  the  Southwestern  states  of 
Arizona,  Colorado,  New  Mexico  and  Utah  seeing 
some  of  the  fastest  rising  spring  and  summer 
temperature trends (Table 1). 

In  recent  years,  researchers  have  begun  to 
investigate  how  human-induced  climate  change 
has influenced wildfires.4 The warming across North 
America over the second half of the 20th century 
has been attributed, in part, to rising concentrations 
of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere.5,6,7  At 
the regional level, however, the precise degree to 
which human activity has influenced the increase 
in  spring  and  summer  temperatures  is  unknown. 
While Westerling3 and others8 have shown a strong 
correlation between these rising temperatures and 
increasing wildfire activity, there are other natural 

and  human  factors  that  likely  play  an  important 
role in these observed changes in wildfires trends. 

Earlier Snowpack Melt

Across the mountainous and forested regions of 
the   West,  spring snowpack and the timing of its melt 
have  a  strong  influence  on  wildfire  susceptibility. 
Below-average snowpack means there is less water 
available in the ground and streams in the hotter 
months. And when the snow begins to melt earlier, 
dictated by warm spring temperatures, the forests 
will remain drier for longer spans of the year. Once 
snowmelt  is  complete,  the  forests  can  become 
combustible within just one month.9

According  to  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey, 
snowpacks    across  most  of  the  West  are  now

Snowmelt is Happening Earlier in the Spring in the West

Figure  10.  Spring snowpack melt is happening earlier across the Western U.S. than it did 50 years ago. Adapted from USGS (2005).

melting  1-4  weeks  earlier  than  they  did  just  50 
years  ago  (Figure  10),  and  streamflows  are  also 
peaking earlier in the year.10

While  we  have  not  specifically  tracked  the 
correlation between annual wildfire behavior and 
the  timing  of  snowpack  melt,  Westerling  et  al.   
showed that between 1970-2003, years with early 
snowmelt corresponded to years with much higher 
wildfire frequency.3 This influence was particularly 
prevalent at higher elevations, in forested regions 
between 1700-2600m, and in the Northern Rockies 
specifically.

Recent research has shown that up to 60 percent 
of  the  observed  changes  in  the  hydrology  of  the 
West    including  these  trends  in  snowpack  and 
melt  that have taken place since the last half of 
the 20th century can be attributed to human caused 
climate change.11 

Other Factors Influencing Western 
Wildfire Trends

Natural Climate Variability

While  there 

is  a  high-level  of  confidence 
amongst  scientists  in  attributing  much  of  the 
recent  warming  trend  globally  to  human  activity, 
natural  climate  variability  also  plays  a  role, 
particularly at the regional scale of the Western U.S. 
Drought levels from year-to-year can influence fire 
patterns for several seasons.8,12 Additionally, natural 
oscillations,  such  as  El  Nino,  the  Pacific  Decadal 
Oscillation and others, have an important influence 
on  climate  variability,  particularly  in  the  Western 
U.S. The extent to which global warming will alter 
these large-scale natural patterns is an active area 
of research.

Insects and Pests

The  spread  of  bark  beetles  and  similar  pests 
across mountain forests of the West have been rapid 
and devastating in the past few decades. Warmer 

winters  have  allowed  more  insects  to  survive 
through  the  cold  seasons  and  hotter  summers 
have,  in  some  cases,  accelerated  the  insects  life 
cycle.  Together,  these  higher  temperatures  have 
fostered a growing infestation and to date nearly 
11  million  acres  of Western  U.S.  forest  have  been 
overwhelmed by bark beetles, spruce beetles, pine 
beetles  and  budworms.  Researchers  project  that 
as  the  planet  warms,  the  outbreak  and  spread  of 
these insects will increase.13

The spread of these pests across the West is also 
a potential driver in wildfire activity.14 As more trees 
die  upon  beetle  infestation,  there  is  more  woody 
debris  left  on  the  forest  floor,  which  means  that 
there is more fuel available for burning in the short 
term.  Recent  research  has  shown,  however,  that 
over  the  long  term,  forests  destroyed  by  beetle 
infestation may not be any more likely to burn than 
healthy forests.15

Natural and Human Factors

From  year  to  year,  the  size  and  frequency  of 
wildfires  changes  and  natural  variations  in  the 
climate  have  always  been  important  drivers  of 
changing fire trends.16 Tree ring and sediment data 
have painted hundreds of years of fire history in the 
West and shown that fires have typically been worse 
during  warm  and  dry  periods,  and  less  extensive 
during  cooler,  wetter  times.  Conversely,  research 
has also shown that during the early 20th century, 
fire  activity  was  lower  than  would  be  expected 
for  the  warmer  and  drier  climate  experienced 
(compared to the previous 3000 years). 

Human  behavior  has  undoubtedly  had  an 
influence  on  this  lower  fire  activity.  Logging  in 
some  parts  of  the West  have  simply  reduced  the 
amount  of  forested  area  available  to  burn  and 
livestock grazing has cut down on the grasses that 
might  otherwise  ignite  and  burn.  And  when  fires 
have  started,  humans  have  tended  to  fight  them 
vigorously to prevent home and property damage. 
Some  researchers  suggest,  however,  that  recent 
wildfire  activity  may  have  naturally  increased  in 
response  to  this fire-deficit;  decades  of  reduced 
fire  activity  may  have  left  the  forests  of  the West 
particularly vulnerable to big fires.16

The Future of Western Wildfires

its  not  surprising 

Given  the  connection  between  wildfire  trends 
and  climatic  factors  such  as  temperatures  and 
seasonal  snowpack, 
that 
scientists  project  that  fires  will  increase  in  the 
coming  decades.  If  atmospheric  greenhouse  gas 
concentrations  continue  to 
increase  globally, 
climate  models  predict  the  Western  U.S.  will  get 
even  hotter  and  drier  by  the  end  of  this  century. 
According to the United Nations Intergovernmental 
Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  4th  Assessment 
Report,  summer  temperatures  could 
increase 

between   3.6-9oF in western North American by the 
middle of this century.17 And as winter conditions 
turn to spring earlier in the year, the fire season will 
also continue to grow longer. 

A  recent  report  from  the  National  Research 
Council  also  reports  that  for  every  degree  Celsius 
(1.8oF)  of  temperature  increase,  the  amount  of 
area  burned  each  year  in  the  Western  U.S.  could 
quadruple  (Figure  11).17  Even  with  remaining 
uncertainty of how precipitation trends will change 
in  the  West,  climate  and  wildfire  research  clearly 
show  that  more  and  bigger  fires  will  become  the 
norm as the climate continues to change.15,18,19 

Higher Temperatures Will Increase Burn Areas In the West

How much more area will burn each 

year if temperatures rise 1.8 oF:

at least 6 times more

5-6 times more 

4-5 times more

3-4 times more 

2 - 3 times more

up to 2 times more

Figure 11.  A 1.8F rise in temperature is projected to dramatically increase the area burned each year by wildfires, in some regions by 

 as much as five or six times.  Adapted from the National Research Councils Climate Stabilization Targets report (2009).

Methodology

Wildfire  data  was  accessed  from  the  Federal 
Wildland  Fire  Database,  provided  by  the  U.S. 
Geological  Survey  (ranging  from  1980-2011)  and 
from a federal land wildfire database compiled by 
the  Desert  Research  Institute  (from  1970-2006). 
Both databases draw on wildfire data reported by 
five  federal  agencies:  U.S.  Forest  Service,  Bureau 
of  Land  Management,  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs, 
National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Services. 
Only  fire  data  from  Arizona,  California,  Colorado, 
Idaho,  Montana,  Nevada,  New  Mexico,  Oregon, 
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming were analyzed.  

For  analyses  that  span  1970-2011,  only  U.S. 
Forest Service (USFS) data was employed, as these 
records  are  the  most  complete  and  consistent 
over this period of time. Data from all sources was 
processed  to  delete  duplicate  fire  entries.  Prior 
to  combining  data  from  the  different  databases, 
we  conducted  an  internal  review  of  data  quality, 
testing years where both databases overlay (1980-
2006). For USFS data, there was less than 1 percent 
discrepancy in the 2,737 large reported during that 
26-year period. 

For  the  analyses  that  span  1980-2011,  fires 
reported by all five federal agencies were included 
(and  thus  only  data  from  the  U.S.  Geological 
Surveys database was used). 

Analyses  of  large  fires  reported  here  are 
restricted  to  fires  over  1,000  acres  in  size.  As 
described  by  Westerling  et  al.,3  these  large  fires 
represent less than 1 percent of reported wildfires 

but  they  represent  more  than  70  percent  of  the 
total  area  burned.  In  other  words,  these  are  truly 
the most damaging fires, and are likely to be the 
ones more heavily influenced by climatic factors. In 
addition, the land management units from which 
we  drew  our  data  contain  more  than  60  percent 
of the forested land in Americas West. To consider 
very large fires, we restricted fires to those over 
10,000 or 25,000 acres. 

The trend lines in the plots presenting number 
of fires and acres burnt have been estimated by a 
linear regression between year and the logarithm 
of the numbers on the y-axis, or through a so-called 
Poisson  regression,  hence  the  upward  curvature 
of  the  line  (which  would  appear  straight  if  the 
y-axis  reported  the  logarithm  of  the  respective 
quantities).  This  methodology  is  known  to  be 
appropriate in the case of values spanning a large 
range  of  orders  of  magnitude  (as  is  the  case  for 
number of acres burnt), or representing counts (as 
is the case for number of fires). The methodology 
also takes into account the obvious increase in the 
variability  of  the  yearly  values  in  step  with  their 
average magnitude.

Average annual spring and summer temperature 
data was calculated from temperature records from 
stations that make up the United States Historical 
Climatological Network (USHCN), restricted to the 
11 Western states listed above. These stations are 
maintained  by  the  National  Climatic  Data  Center. 
These  records  were  also  used  to  evaluate  the 
temperature change trends between 1970-2011.
