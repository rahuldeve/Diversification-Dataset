Energy Efficiency in Buildings

About this report
This report summarizes the first year’s work of
the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) project –
a WBCSD project co-chaired by Lafarge and
United Technologies Corporation. It presents a
picture of the challenge of energy use in
buildings and a preliminary, high-level approach
to addressing that challenge. The next phase of
the project will develop those ideas. (See page

The urgent challenge of energy efficiency
Buildings are responsible for at least 40% of
energy use in most countries. The absolute
figure is rising fast, as construction booms,
especially in countries such as China and India.
It is essential to act now, because buildings can
make a major contribution to tackling climate
change and energy use.
Progress can begin immediately because
knowledge and technology exist today to slash
the energy buildings use, while at the same time
improving levels of comfort. Behavioral,
organizational and financial barriers stand in the
way of immediate action, and three approaches
can help overcome them:
•

•

•

Enc oura ge i nterd ep endence by
adopting holistic, integrated approaches
among the stakeholders that assure a shared
responsibility and accountability toward
improved energy performance in buildings
and their communities
Ma ke energy mor e v alu ed by those
involved in the development, operation and
use of buildings
Tra nsfor m behav ior by educating and
motivating the professionals involved in
building transactions to alter their course
toward improved energy efficiency in
buildings.

The EEB project covers six countries or regions
that are together responsible for two-thirds of
world energy demand, including developed and
developing countries and a range of climates:
Brazil, China, Europe, India, Japan and the
United States. The project has brought together
leading companies in the building industry1
(shown on final page) to tackle this vitally
important subject. This group has bridged
isolated specialist “silos” to develop a crossindustry view of energy efficiency and to identify
the approaches that can be used to transform
energy performance.
Many organizations, both public and private,
are working on building sustainability. This
project aims to complement them by providing
a business perspective and developing practical
action for property developers, regulators,
energy providers and suppliers of products and
services to the building industry.
This report aims to stimulate the widest possible
debate about the route to achieving the EEB
vision of zero net energy use in buildings. Please
participate in the EEB blog at www.eeb-blog.org
or send your thoughts to the project director,
Christian Kornevall, at kornevall@wbcsd.org.

The project summarizes these findings in this, its
first year report on facts and trends having to do
with energy efficiency in buildings. This report
combines the findings from existing research
and stakeholder dialogues during hearings,
workshops, and forums with a breakthrough
market research study that measures the
stakeholder perceptions of sustainable buildings
around the world. The report sets out to
establish a baseline of current facts and trends
that will be used in the coming months in
scenario planning and modeling approaches to
assess the needed and prioritized actions for
change to affect buildings’ energy consumption.
In the final year (by mid-2009), the project will
seek to gain commitments to actions by the
various stakeholders involved with the building
sector, including those of the project itself.

For the EEB project, the “building industry” covers all
buildings and all those involved in the value chain – from
architects and property developers to occupiers.

The vision: Zero net energy for buildings
“A building has a long life cycle, so its effect on the
environment is a long and continuing issue to
consider.”
NGO, China2

reduction measures with no net cost could
almost halve expected growth in global
electricity demand. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment
Report estimates that by 2020 CO2 emissions
from building energy use can be reduced by
29% at no net cost.

Summary:
•

•
•

Urgent action is needed to reduce buildings’
energy use, thus addressing climate change and
energy use.
We can dramatically improve energy efficiency
today with existing technologies.
Businesses that engage early with energy
efficiency for buildings can gain a market
advantage.

The EEB vision is a world in which buildings
consume zero net energy. It is ambitious, but
ambition is necessary to achieve the progress
needed to address climate change and energy
use.
Progress must be made now if we are to vastly
improve the energy efficiency of both new and
existing buildings. Examples exist of where this
is being and can be achieved – see EEB around
the world on pages 5, 20 and 24. And there are
many ambitious goals; for example, the UK
government anticipates dramatic energy
reductions to achieve its goal that all new
homes in England will be carbon-neutral by
2016.
There are three main approaches to energy
neutrality:
•

•
•

Cut buildings’ energy demand by, for
example, using equipment that is more
energy efficient
Produce energy locally from renewable and
otherwise wasted energy resources
Share energy – create buildings that can
generate surplus energy and feed it into an
intelligent grid infrastructure.

Efficiency gains in buildings are likely to provide
the greatest energy reductions and in many
cases will be the most economical option. A
study by McKinsey3 estimated that demand

About the EEB vision
• What is zero net energy?
It means buildings as a whole (but not every
individual building) would generate as much
energy as they use over the course a year.
• Why energy, not carbon?
Using more non-fossil fuels (solar and wind) will
address climate change and energy security,
but cutting energy consumption is also vital.
• Why energy used on site, not primary energy?
This project focuses on the demand side of
buildings’ energy and on action within the
building value chain rather than on energy
generation and transmission.
• What is meant by energy efficiency?
Efficiency involves reduced energy consumption
for acceptable levels of comfort, air quality and
other occupancy requirements, including the
energy used in manufacturing building
materials and in construction.

The business opportunity
The need for much-improved energy efficiency
presents risks and opportunities for companies in the
building industry seeking to enter this market. The
EEB Project’s view is that early entrants can gain firstmover advantage, but there are risks, especially with
regards to the timing of market entry.

Market risks
The timing and pace of rising demand for energy
efficiency is uncertain and poses the most significant
risk for market entrants. Demand is expected to grow
as people become more aware of the importance of
energy use in buildings. The value proposition will
continue to develop, given the right market
structures and instruments. The key question is how
fast these changes will occur.

Operational risks
Businesses need the skills to devise attractive, energy
efficient propositions at appropriate cost levels. The
project’s perception research found that there is a
widespread lack of personal and corporate knowhow in the market and a general reluctance to
innovate (see page 12).

Strategic assessment4
There are potential first-mover advantages for
companies entering the energy efficiency market.
Subsequent competitors will face barriers to entry in
the form of specialist know-how, which should result
in a lower level of competition than in the
mainstream market. This in turn will tilt the balance
of power in favor of suppliers rather than buyers, due
to the relatively low number of suppliers with the
necessary expertise. Energy efficient property could
lose value if demand for office and retail sites falls
because of a rise in working at home and on-line
shopping.

“I expect industry will see this as an opportunity rather
than something that we will impose.”
EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs
speaking at the EEB Brussels Forum

Forces – see http://www.quickmba.com/strategy/porter.shtml.

Energy efficient buildings around the world
Västra Hamnen (Western Harbor), Malmö, Sweden

Sweden’s Bo01 housing estate (the first stage of the Western Harbor redevelopment) was
completed in 2001. It was designed as a sustainable urban environment, including 100%
renewable energy supply, increased biodiversity and a waste management system designed to use
waste and sewage as an energy source.
The houses are built to minimize heat and electricity consumption. Well-insulated buildings with
low-energy windows decrease heating needs, and the installed electrical equipment is highly
energy efficient. Each unit is designed to use no more than 105 kWh/m2/year, including household
electricity.

Alarming energy growth

The WBCSD identified buildings as one of the
five main users of energy where “megatrends”
are needed to transform energy efficiency. They
account for 40% of primary energy5 in most
countries covered by this project, and
consumption is rising. The International Energy
Agency (IEA) estimates that current trends in
energy demand for buildings will stimulate
about half of energy supply investments to
2030.6
Summary:
•
•
•

•

Building energy use will grow rapidly without
improvements in energy efficiency.
The building market has many segments with
widely varying characteristics.
Building energy use is driven by demographics,
economic development, lifestyles, changes in
energy sources and technology.
The vast majority of energy consumption occurs
while a building is occupied.

The scale of current property stock in several
countries or regions, broken down into commercial
and residential occupancy, is shown in Figure 2.8 The
property market in China is particularly notable and
is growing rapidly; China is adding 2 billion square
meters a year, equivalent to one-third of Japan's
existing building area.9 This means China is building
the equivalent of Japan's building area every three
years.

If building site energy consumption in China
and India grows to current US levels, China’s
and India's consumption will be respectively
about four and seven times greater than they
are today. Figure 1 shows a projection based on
current population forecasts combined with
current energy use per capita based on
Japanese and US levels – what could be
considered the best and worst case scenarios.
(The arrows show consumption levels in 2003.)
This highlights the fact that energy
consumption will grow dramatically without
action to improve energy efficiency
substantially. The construction boom, especially
in China, is increasing energy demand
significantly, but economic development and
other factors are adding to the challenge
because they also increase buildings’ energy
needs.

There are large differences in space per person
between regions (see Figure 3), especially the
much greater residential space per capita in the
US. The differences are less marked in
commercial buildings, except for China, which
currently uses much less commercial space per
capita than other regions. This has significant
implications for energy use, assuming that space
demands in China move toward those in
Europe and Japan, if not the US.

Energy use for buildings in the US is substantially
higher than in the other regions, and this is likely
to continue (see Figure 4). Consumption in
China and India will grow rapidly, however, and
China’s building energy consumption will be
approaching Europe’s by 2030, while India will
have overtaken Japan. If current trends
continue, commercial building energy use in
China will more than double during this period.
Energy consumption in Western Europe will rise
only moderately and will remain flat in Japan.
Building energy in Brazil will grow, but will
remain relatively small in 2030 compared with
other regions.

This report and this project focus on the energy
demands of buildings (site energy). The sources of
energy vary greatly (see Figure 5), with a significant
amount of coal and biomass burned on site in
China and India, but with a much higher share of
electricity being used in other countries. This
variation contributes to large differences in primary
energy consumption (see Figure 6) because of the
additional energy demands of power generation
and distribution. Development and urbanization are
associated with increased electricity use, which will
significantly increase primary energy demand in
China and India. Figure 6 also emphasizes the scale
of primary energy demand by US commercial
space.

More than four-fifths of site energy use typically
occurs in the operational phase of a building’s
life, as Figure 7 shows. The proportion of
energy embodied in materials and construction
will rise if operational energy efficiency
increases and if building life spans shorten.

and construction, 12%
Use, 84% (heating, ventilation,

End uses vary by sector, region and climate. For
example, refrigeration is a major user of energy
in food retailing, while non-food retail uses
substantially more energy for lighting than
other sectors do. Food service and food sales
are high-intensity sub-sectors, but the large
amount of office space means this is likely to be
the greatest overall energy user. Energy use
varies among residential buildings, but space
and water heating are substantial components
in most regions. This is true for the US despite
the widespread use of energy for space cooling
in hotter states.

Segmenting the building market
The EEB Project is developing a database of
information on the nature of each sub-sector
and its energy-use characteristics that will be
used in the next phase of the project to build
scenarios. The major division by property type is
between commercial and residential. But there
are significant differences between commercial
sub-sectors (such as offices, retail, banking and
hotels). These other attributes are also
important:
•

New versus existing buildings

•

Rural versus urban

•

Developed versus developing countries

•

Climate variations - humidity and rainfall as
well as temperature

Energy use in buildings
Energy efficiency factors in buildings vary
according to geography, climate, building type
and location. The distinction between
developed and developing countries is
important, as is the contrast between retrofitting
existing buildings and new construction. In all
cases there are different standards of building
quality. It is vital that energy efficiency
permeates all levels and is not restricted to highend properties.
This complexity means it is impossible to
develop a single solution for all markets and all
cultures. Instead, the EEB project aims to
identify approaches, market factors and policy
initiatives that will together achieve the needed
results. These will be developed in the next
stage of the project’s work.
Climate change will increase site energy
demand as people seek to maintain comfort
levels in more extreme conditions. The other
main drivers are:

A complex sector
“A single architect cannot do anything sustainable.
He needs electrical engineers, structural engineers, all
these professionals working together.”
Architect, Brazil

The building market is diverse and complex. The
commercial relationships between the many
specialists involved are intricate and critical in
sparking action on energy efficiency.
The sector is characterized by the fragmentation
within sections of the value chain and nonintegration among them.

Summary:
• The sector is characterized by fragmentation
within sections of the value chain and nonintegration between them.
• Incentives to reduce energy use are usually split
between different players and not matched to
those who can save the most through energy
efficiency.

Even the largest players are small and relatively
local by international business standards, with
the exception of materials and equipment
suppliers.
Figure 8 illustrates the most significant
commercial relationships in the building supply
chain. The complexity of interaction among
these participants is one of the greatest barriers
to energy efficient buildings.

Loc al aut horiti es influence the value chain
through enacting building policies for their
areas. These rules are often a compromise
between high levels of energy performance and
cost considerations.16
Ca pital prov id ers, such as lenders or
investors, are overwhelmingly concerned with
the risk and return equation. They often
consider only a short time period, which can
reduce energy use to a relatively minor factor in
decision-making.

Develop ers are the primary actors in
commercial construction and are frequently
speculative, which inevitably results in a shortterm focus on buildings’ financial value.
Speculative developers will only be interested in
energy efficiency if it is a significant factor in the
buying decision. On the other hand, developers
who hold property to receive income from
tenants have a longer term view, which may
make energy-saving investments attractive. But
developers may not be able to reap the benefits
of such investments, as energy cost saving goes
to the occupier even though the developer
incurs the investment cost. This weakens the
incentive for energy efficiency investments.

Energy Efficiency in Buildings

Developers c o m mi s si o n d e si g ner s ( or
ar c hitect s) , e ngi neer s a nd c o n stru cti o n
c o m p a ni es who have expertise in technical
aspects of construction, including energy
efficiency. But their influence on key decisions
may be limited, especially if they do not work
together in an integrated fashion.

E nd u ser s are often in the best position to
benefit from energy savings, but they may not
be in a position to make the necessary
investments. This also depends on the financial
arrangements among owners, agents and users,
which may include a fixed energy fee regardless
of consumption.

The role of a g e nt s can be important. They
often stand between developers and tenants
and between owners and occupiers. Typically,
their financial interests are short-term.

Figure 9 illustrates the decision-making “islands”
that are typical in commercial developments.
The first pyramid describes the various technical
disciplines involved in the building sector. The
second pyramid describes the building delivery
process. Combined, the third pyramid highlights
the ineffective coordination that exists because
of the functional gaps and management
discontinuities. There are often lengthy delays
between the design stages, due to problems
with planning permission, project financing or
signing up of anchor tenants for commercial
property.

O w ner s may rent their buildings, making their
interests different from those of end users.
Some owners buy to sell (and make a capital
return); others buy to lease (as an investment)
or occupy. The last group is most likely to
consider investments that may have paybacks
over several years.

Figu re 9: Players and practices in the building market17

More vertical integration in the supply chain
can improve energy efficiency in buildings. But
fully integrated design/build projects are
perceived to be more costly to implement.18
Many property developers believe competition
rather than cooperation results in lower bids in
a tendering process.

The isolated roles and ineffective coordination
between participants have two important
consequences:
•

•

Incentives to reduce energy use are
usually split between different players and
not matched to those who can invest in
and benefit from energy-saving measures.
There is normally very little opportunity for
users to provide feedback through the
market to developers or designers.

Barriers within the industry
“I think the real estate agents don’t know anything
about energy efficiency. And I think the bank is a
barrier, because they’re not demanding it for their
loan.”
NGO, US

Summary:
• Building professionals tend to underestimate the
contribution of buildings’ energy to climate
change and to overestimate the cost of saving
energy.
• Know-how and experience are lacking in these
professions.
• Our research found four key deficiencies:
personal know-how, business community
acceptance, corporate conviction and personal
commitment.
• There is a lack of leadership on building
sustainability.

Progress on energy efficiency depends on
people in the building industry being aware of
the importance of the issue, and then being able
and willing to act on it. Awareness is high in
most countries covered by this project, but there
are significant barriers preventing widespread
involvement.

Technical details
Lippincott Mercer designed qualitative and
quantitative research (carried out by GfK) on
behalf of the EEB project. It was designed to
gauge current levels of support among opinion
leaders, policy-makers and the business people
who finance, design, build and occupy
buildings. It measured:
•

•
•

The research covered eight countries – Japan,
China, India, Brazil, the US, Spain, France and
Germany – and investigated perceptions and
attitudes about building sustainability in general.
Qualitat ive resea rc h was conducted with
three groups:
•
•
•

The EEB project commissioned research that
identified serious gaps in knowledge about
energy efficiency among building professionals,
as well as a lack of leadership throughout the
industry.
The research investigated perceptions of
sustainability in relation to buildings, including
the use of the terms “green” and “sustainable”.
The word sustainable tends to be more
prominent in Europe, while green is more suited
to Asia, especially Japan. Regardless of the term
used, energy costs and energy use were the
highest priorities for building professionals. Their
other prominent objectives were occupant wellbeing and productivity, conservation of water,
and reducing the risks from rising energy costs.
Potential future resale value and reputational
benefits for companies were ranked lowest of
the main factors.

Perceptions of “sustainable” or “green”
buildings, including an exploration of that
terminology
The level of understanding and level of
maturity of this concept
The readiness to adopt sustainable building
practices and the constraints faced by
professionals such as investors, architects
and contractors.

Opinion leaders – architects, journalists,
NGOs, academics
Regulators – policy-makers, politicians,
regulators
The finance community – analysts,
financiers, property investment companies.

Researchers carried out in-depth interviews with
45 people between October 2006 and January
2007. The interviews covered attitudes toward
sustainable buildings, barriers and the role of the
EEB project in driving change.
Qua ntitat i ve res earch questioned three
broad sub-groups of building professionals:
•

•
•

Specifiers and developers – including
architects, engineers, builders and
contractors
Agents and professional landlords –
including corporate building owners
Corporate tenants.

Researchers interviewed 1,423 people between
November 2006 and February 2007, using a
telephone questionnaire.
The research did not include private landlords or
homeowners.

Attitudinal segments
The research identified four broad attitudinal
segments among building professionals (see
Figure 10). The segmentation is based on
personal know-how and the extent of personal
conviction or commitment to sustainable
buildings. Each box in the Figure shows the
characteristics of the segment, including the
level of awareness of and involvement in
sustainable buildings. (These figures relate to the
“purchase funnel” in Figure 13.) The boxes also
indicate the key requirements to move groups
toward the “leader” quadrant.

Professionals’ knowledge of
sustainable building issues
People recognize that sustainable buildings are
important for the environment but
underestimate buildings’ contribution to
greenhouse gas levels (see Figure 11), which is
actually about 40%.

They also generally overestimate the cost
premium (see Figure 12), which is likely to be
under 5% in developed countries, although
possibly higher in China, Brazil and India.

Awareness and involvement20
Awareness of environmental building issues is
relatively high in all markets. But in most
markets the numbers drop sharply on
questions about involvement in green building
activity. Typically only a third of those who said
they were aware of green buildings had
considered involvement, and only a third of
that smaller group had actually been involved
(11% of the total). Figure 13 shows the
percentages of respondents who are aware,
have considered it and have been involved. It
also indicates the percentages at each of these
stages. For example, in France 32% of those
who are aware have considered sustainable
building, and 30% of those who have
considered it have been involved, which means
only 8% of respondents have direct experience.

Overall, only 13% of respondents have been
involved in green/sustainable building,
although this figure ranges from 45% in
Germany to just 5% in India and from 20%
among specifiers and developers to just 9%
among owners and tenants.

“I would say that a lack of in-depth understanding
is a barrier, but not a lack of awareness. 100% of
the developers in the United States have heard of
green buildings.”

The results in Japan are particularly interesting – 13% awareness of green/sustainable buildings compared to an average for
other regions of 84%. This is odd given that its building energy use is the lowest of the developed countries.

Barriers to progress
Qualitative research found that people believe
financiers and developers are the main barriers
to more sustainable approaches in the building
value chain.

Figu re 14: Factors influencing adopti on of
sustainable building practices

“The biggest barrier is that investors have the final
decision-making authority on buildings and, under
current circumstances, they are pursuing profit
maximization. Sustainable building option conflicts
with profit maximization.”
Academic, Japan

The quantitative research identified eight factors
that influence decision-makers about
sustainable buildings (see Figure 14). Four of
these are the main barriers to greater
consideration and adoption by building
professionals and are the most significant in
influencing respondents’ consideration of
“sustainable building”:
•

•

Pers o nal k n o w- h o w – whether people
understand how to improve a building’s
environmental performance and where to
go for good advice
B u si ne ss c o m m u nity a c c ept a n c e –
whether people think the business
community in their market sees sustainable
buildings as a priority

Leadership

•

•

A s u p p ortive c or p or ate
env iro nm e nt – whether people think
their company’s leaders will support them
in decisions to build sustainably
Pers o nal c o m m itm ent – whether
action on the environment is important to
them as individuals.

When asked about their responsibility in driving
change, very few decision-makers saw their
task as leading the move to sustainable
building (see Figure 15). The answers suggest
some willingness to adopt new practices, but
also hint at the conservatism for which the
building industry is renowned.

Summary:
•

•

Technology is available, but businesses need to
be supported by appropriate policies and
regulations.
Three approaches can help to break down the
barriers: a holistic design approach, financial
mechanisms and relationships and behavioral
changes.

The knowledge, technology and skills are
already available but are not being widely used
to achieve dramatically lower energy use in
buildings. The previous pages have shown that
progress is hampered by barriers in the form of
industry structure and practices, professionals’
lack of know-how and support and a lack of
leadership.
21

Policy and regulation
Appropriate policies and regulations are essential
to achieve market changes. Climate change was
described as “the greatest and widest ranging

Control and regulatory instruments
Appliance standards
Mandatory labeling & certification programs
Energy efficiency obligations & quotas
Utility demand-side management programs
Economic and market-based instruments
Energy performance contracting
Fiscal instruments and incentives
Tax exemptions and reductions
Support, information and voluntary action
Voluntary certification and labeling
Public leadership programs

Establishing a carbon price, through tax,
trading or regulation
Technology policy to support low-carbon
innovation
Removal of barriers to behavioral change,
for example through information and
standard setting.

Businesses in the building industry need a
supportive policy and regulatory framework to
achieve dramatic improvements in energy
efficiency. This is supported by the project’s
research findings on industry leadership, which
reveal that many building industry professionals
only adopt new practices if they are required by
regulation (see page 11).
Governments need to concentrate on the most
efficient and cost-effective approaches. Research
for the UNEP Sustainable Buildings and
Construction Initiative (SBCI) found that the
most effective instruments achieve net savings
for society and that packages of measures
combining different elements are desirable.13 The
study identified policies that were both
successful in reducing emissions and costeffective. Table 1 shows the most successful
instruments in each of four categories.

Governments in the countries covered by this
project have introduced building codes and
other relevant policies, as Table 2 illustrates. But
more needs to be done to encourage improved
energy performance.

It is not the role of this project to define policy
details but to identify key areas where policy
initiatives can help influence holistic design,
financial decision-making and behavior.

In line with business interests, a more effective
policy framework for energy efficiency should
cover the following:
•
•
•

•

•

•

Urban planning (see page 22)
More-effective building codes to enforce
minimum required technical standards
Information and communication, to
overcome the lack of know-how and to
highlight the energy performance of
individual buildings; a combination of
voluntary and mandatory schemes is already
emerging, for example: voluntary labeling
schemes such as CASBEE (Japan) and LEED
(US) and the building “energy passport”
(EU)
Incentives, including tax incentives, to
encourage energy efficiency in building
equipment, materials and occupant
consumption
Energy pricing to make energy more valued
by users, to decouple utilities’ revenues from
the volume of energy supplied and to
encourage local and renewable generation;
for example, electricity consumers in
Germany receive credit for power fed into
the grid from local generation at a rate four
times the cost of the electricity they use from
the grid
Enforcement, measurement and verification
to make sure policies and regulations
(including building codes) are effective and
support market measures such as trading.

Policy as a supportive framework for
business levers
Given a supportive policy framework, there are
three approaches that can help break down the
barriers: a holistic design approach, financial
mechanisms and relationships, and behavioral
changes. These can change the ways that the
market and individuals respond, increasing the
market value of energy efficient buildings, and
they will enable the isolated “silos” in the
building industry to work across boundaries and
increase the focus on energy efficiency in several
ways:

•
•
•

•
•

The financial community will support
investments in energy efficiency.
The design community will produce energy
efficient designs.
The materials and equipment community
will offer products and services that support
those designs economically.
Building owners and operators will support
and value energy efficient operations.
Utilities will support intelligent distribution
and sustainable content of energy to and
from buildings.

These separate elements need to work together
to maximize the potential of each, supported by
effective policies and regulation, as Figure 16
illustrates.

TERI RETREAT, Gurgaon, India
The RETREAT is a part of TERI’s Gual Pahari campus, about 30 km south of Delhi. It
demonstrates efficient use of natural resources, clean and renewable energy technologies and
efficient waste management. The 3,000 m² training center is independent of the city’s electricity
grid system. The peak electricity load is only 96 kW, compared to a conventional 280 kW peak.
There are three important aspects of the design:
•

The functionality of the building and how energy is used in it.

•

“Passive” concepts that minimize energy demands, such as solar orientation, latticework for
shading, insulation and landscaping.

•

Space conditioning and lighting demands that are met through energy efficient systems
using renewable energy sources.

Various passive design concepts have resulted in the reduction of space conditioning loads by
10–15%:
•

The building is oriented along the east–west axis to have maximum exposure along north
and south.

•

Roof insulation uses vermiculite concrete and China mosaic white finish.

•

Wall insulation uses expanded polystyrene.

•

Part of the building is sunk into the ground to stabilize internal temperature.

•

Shading devices and windows have been designed to cut out summer sun and to let in
winter sun.

•

Glare-free daylight has been provided, using specially designed skylights.

•

Landscaping affects wind directions.

•

Deciduous trees are used in the southern side of the building to shade it during summer
but let in the winter sun.

Encouraging
interdependence with a
holistic approach
“Today it is possible, based on the geographical
positioning of the building, the type of construction,
thinking about the thickness of the walls, insulation,
all that… it is possible to employ techniques that
allow us to spend less energy.”
NGO, Brazil

Summary:
•
•
•

•

•

Energy efficiency in buildings should begin at the
neighborhood or city planning stage.
The holistic approach must consider energy use
over the whole life cycle of the building.
Holistic design combines different components
and technology in the building in an integrated
approach rather than focusing on individual
elements.
The building “envelope” 22 is critical to energy
efficient design, which also needs to integrate
shade, orientation, daylight, ventilation and
appropriate materials.
Design should include on-site energy generation
from renewable and otherwise wasted
resources.

A holistic approach begins with master planning,
takes the whole life cycle into account and
embraces integrated building design processes.
This approach is essential to maximize the
potential of individual technologies and
innovations. It begins at the community
planning level to gain efficiencies on a larger
scale than can be achieved in individual
buildings and to integrate other energy uses,
such as transport. Master planning considers the
community in its entirety as well as single
buildings. Some new urban centers are being
created from scratch with an entirely sustainable
plan, like Dongtan near Shanghai, China, and
Songdo, Korea. But many existing and rapidly
growing cities have little room to maneuver due
to existing constraints. In that case, master
planning has to be implemented within the
existing urban environment.

Within individual buildings, efficiency is
improved with a greater degree of collaboration
between specialists from the earliest stages of the
design process. Integration helps to adopt
approaches, technologies and materials that can
significantly lower energy use in buildings in
economically attractive ways. Costs can be
minimized with this holistic approach to
integrated design and innovation.

Lifespan and embodied energy
A holistic approach considers impacts during the
life of a specific building or component rather
than focusing on only one phase, such as
construction, use or disposal.
Such a life-cycle approach can be applied to a
specific material or component, a single building
element (wall, window or equipment), an entire
building or even a city. In practice, it is helpful to
narrow the scope of the variables to be
optimized. For example, the UK Building
Research Establishment focuses on energy,
material and water consumption, and air and
water emissions. A similar approach has been
taken in France with the “Fiches de déclarations
environnementales et sanitaires” (see
www.inies.fr).
The building sector’s environmental footprint
needs to be addressed at every phase, depicted
in Figure 17.

About 84% of total building energy is typically
consumed during the use phase, assuming a
building life of more than 50 years. The building
lifespan is important, as the impact of embodied
energy (used in the extraction, processing and
transport of building materials and in
construction) will be more significant if the
building lifespan is shorter. The challenge in
reducing energy demand of buildings during
the use phase is to avoid increasing the energy
use in other phases.

occupant health and security. Most projects
follow a sequential approach, finalizing one
stage before moving to the next, with fee
structures aligned to this linear approach and
compartmentalization. Designers need to be able
to carry out extra iterations, revisiting earlier
stages, to optimize the many factors and
introduce cost-effective innovations at an early
stage.
An Integrated Design Process (IDP) involves all
participants in the early design phase of the
project. Multi-disciplinary workshops bring
together owners, architects, engineers and
others. They cooperate across the different
specialties rather than working in the traditional
“silo” approach that involves little
communication between specialists and results
in buildings with sub-optimal performance.

The lifetime of buildings has been decreasing,
and this trend needs to be reversed to spread
the embodied energy over a longer period. The
life of a building can be prolonged by using
high-quality construction systems and building
materials, anticipating and designing out
maintenance and repair, and designing in
flexibility so that changes of use are practical
during the building’s lifetime.

IDP can achieve improved building performance
with lower costs and fewer disruptive changes
during the later project stages. Figure 18 shows
that the earlier in the process that IDP occurs,
the greater the impact on building performance
and the lower the impact on costs.

Integrated building design
Many professionals are involved at different
stages of a design project, and many factors
need to be taken into account: climate, building
shape, comfort levels, materials and systems,

Design components

Considering equipment and infrastructure is also
important, while the design brings together all
the influences on energy efficiency.

Building performance depends not only on the
performance of individual elements but also on
how they perform as integrated systems. The
building envelope is particularly important. It is
the starting point of energy efficient buildings
and the main determinant of the amount of
energy required to heat, cool and ventilate.
Specifically, it determines how airtight a building
is, how much heat is transmitted through
“thermal bridges” (which breach insulation and
allow heat to flow in or out) and how much
natural light and ventilation can be used.

Figure 19 illustrates the inter-relationships among
these four main influences on energy efficiency
and the key energy consumers. The chart shows
that most categories of energy use are affected
by more than one influence. For example, all
four elements affect the energy needs for
heating, ventilation and air conditioning
(HVAC).

PassivHaus
PassivHaus, which began in Germany in 1991, has developed an approach that can reduce the energy
demands of a building to one-twentieth of the norm but still provide comfortable conditions. There are
more than 6,000 buildings that meet the PassivHaus standard – offices as well as apartments and houses,
as well as new and renovated buildings.
There are five key elements for PassivHaus:
•
•
•

•

23

The envelope – all components should be highly insulated.
Airtightness – stop air leakage through unsealed joints.
Ventilation – use a mechanical system with heat recovery so that hot air leaving the building warms
the cooler air coming in.
Thermal “bridges” – eliminate heat loss from poorly insulated points in windows, doors or other parts
of the envelope.
Windows – minimize heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer.

Council House 2, Melbourne
Council House 2 (CH2) is a 10-story office building for City of Melbourne staff. It has ground-floor
retail spaces and underground parking and was officially opened in August 2006.
CH2 was designed to copy the planet’s ecology, using the natural 24-hour cycle of solar energy,
natural light, air and rainwater to power, heat, cool and supply water to the building.
The north façade has 10 dark-colored air ducts that absorb heat from the sun. The hot air rises,
taking the stale air up and out of the building. The south façade has light-colored ducts that draw in
fresh air from the roof and distribute it down through the building. The west façade has louvers
made from recycled timber that move according to the position of the sun and are powered by
photovoltaic roof panels.

The technologies used include:
•

Undulating high thermal mass concrete ceilings which improve air circulation, cooling and
natural light and reduce energy demands by 14% in summer

•

Photovoltaic cells, which power a façade of louvers

•

Rooftop solar panels for water heating

•

Glare control throughout the building

•

“Shower towers” that cool water and air using low amounts of energy

•

A green roof space generating oxygen

•

Roof-mounted wind turbines that purge air during the night and generate electricity during
the day

•

Solar shading on the exterior and interior of the building and automatic night-purge
windows to cool the concrete ceilings.

The building consumes approximately 35 kWh/m²/year. Compared to the previous Council
building (c1970), this equals savings of:
•

82% electricity consumption

•

87% gas consumption

•

72% mains water supply.

Financial savings of US$ 1.196 million annually, including US$ 272.366 in electricity, gas and
water.
CH2 will pay for its sustainability features, worth US$ 9.330 million, in a decade.

“Investors and developers would gladly invest in
sustainable building if it is made clear that
construction of sustainable building generates high
asset value in the future, and also contributes to
profitability.“
Academic, Japan

Summary:
•
•
•
•

•

Energy is a small proportion of cost for most
decision-makers in the building value chain.
The cost of energy efficiency is typically overestimated.
Reliable data are often lacking.
A more sophisticated risk-management model
may be necessary to assess building energy
investments.
New business models can help to increase the
focus on energy efficiency and drive investment.

Financial considerations are critical to property
development and investment, but they appear
to be limiting the advance of energy efficiency.
This is true of major development projects as
well as smaller investments in improvements of
individual buildings, including energy efficiency
projects.
Financial pressures have become more powerful,
especially in the US, because of the rise of real
estate as an investment class alongside equities
and bonds and a decline in the number of
owner-occupied buildings. Owner-occupiers are
in the best position to make long-term
investment decisions about their buildings. They
will tend to have a longer term perspective and
stand to benefit directly from energy savings.
This applies both to owners specifying a new
building that they will occupy as well as to
existing owner-occupiers considering retrofitting.
On the other hand, investors’ time horizons are
likely to be shorter. This increases the
importance for their investment calculations of
the property’s residual value when they sell
compared with operational returns during their
ownership. In any case, energy costs are often
hidden in operational costs and not considered
by most investors.

There is some evidence that an energy efficient
building can command a premium, and this
may increase as awareness of climate change
and expectations of rising energy costs leads
people and organizations to attach more value
to energy efficiency. A McGraw-Hill study24
reported that professionals expect “greener
buildings” to achieve an average increase in
value of 7.5% over comparable standard
buildings, together with a 6.6% improved return
on investment. Average rents were expected to
be 3% higher. In the US, buildings with high
energy performance are becoming more
attractive financially because of markets for
renewable energy (in 20 states as of mid-2007)
and energy efficiency credits (10 states).

Energy cost significance
Energy is typically a small proportion of total
occupancy costs for buildings. Real estate
managers at the EEB’s financial hearing in Zurich
said that energy costs were too low to be a
driver for energy efficiency (see Figure 20). For
example, in a high-quality office building in
Germany, heating and electricity made up less
than 5% of the total operating cost of the
building, including rent and maintenance
(about €1.1 of out of every €23.3 spent).
The demand for higher quality office buildings
will further decrease the importance of energy
costs. High-quality buildings have higher
operating and energy costs, but the energy
proportion decreases relative to the total, as
Figure 20 shows.

The cost of achieving energy
efficiency
EEB research (reported on pages 6 and 7)
found that perceptions of the cost necessary to
achieve greener buildings are likely to be
significantly higher than the actual cost. The
average perception was a 17% premium, but
cost studies on actual properties have shown
much lower figures. For commercial properties,
the Fraunhofer Institute has shown that the
energy demand of new office buildings can be
reduced by 50% compared with the existing
building stock without increasing construction
26
costs.
The US Green Building Council has performed
numerous studies and concluded that the cost
of reaching certification under its Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
standards system is between zero and 3%,
while the cost of reaching the highest level of
LEED (platinum) comes at a cost premium of
less than 10%. These figures are supported by
a study of 40 US offices and schools that
found cost premiums substantially lower than
professionals’ estimates revealed in this project’s
research (16% for US). 27
A more comprehensive study by Davis
Langdon Adamson, a construction
management services firm, confirmed these
broad conclusions but with an important
caveat: location and climate are more
important than the level of energy efficiency to
the ultimate cost. The survey looked at more
than 600 projects in 19 US states and

examined the impact on cost of location and
climate. Figure 21 shows the additional cost
necessary to meet the relevant LEED level.
This analysis shows that variations between
cost premiums in different locations can be
more pronounced than the cost differential
between different levels of environmental
performance.
Retrofitting energy efficiency in existing
buildings can also be cost-effective. Research
for the IEA on high-rise apartments in the
European Union concluded that substantial
energy savings could be achieved in hot and
cold climates, with significant net cost savings.
28
As much as 80% of heating energy was
saved in the least efficient buildings, with an
overall 28% energy saving. The study showed
that retrofitting was most cost-effective when
carried out as part of general refurbishment.

Information
While energy costs are a relatively small part of
total occupancy costs, they are the most
important to gain energy efficiency. Profitable
opportunities for energy savings are often
overlooked because of inadequate cost
information. Despite the stated interest of real
estate managers in energy efficiency, a study in
2007 found that only two-thirds of the
companies tracked energy data and only 60%
tracked energy costs.29 Only 30% of real estate
managers or facilities managers claimed to have
included energy efficiency requirements in
requests for proposals.

Energy Efficiency in Buildings

Research by the Green Building Finance
Consortium in the US indicates that owners and
developers often do not provide appraisers with
sufficient data to allow a thorough assessment
of the costs and benefits of energy efficiency
strategies. Too much reliance is placed on “first
cost,” the initial investment required, rather than
life-cycle cost assessments and return-oninvestment calculations.
Energy managers and investment decisionmakers need to develop a common
methodology and language for valuing energy
efficiency projects in a similar manner to other
investments. A financial risk management model
would30 identify:
• Energy consumption elements directly
affected by changes within the facility
(intrinsic volatilities), which includes the
energy volume risk, asset performance risk
and energy baseline uncertainty risk.
• Energy consumption risks outside the facility
that could be hedgeable (extrinsic
volatilities), which includes energy price risk,
labor cost risk, interest rate risk and currency
risk.

Energy Service Companies (ESCOs)
Appropriate commercial relationships can
increase the focus on energy costs and avoid
the split incentive problem. ESCOs are one
example.
ESCOs engage in energy performance
contracting – an arrangement with a property
owner that covers both the financing and
management of energy-related costs.
Initial investment and life-cycle cost
considerations are taken on by the ESCO. These
companies generally act as project developers
for a wide range of tasks and assume the
technical and performance risks associated with
the project. An ESCO develops, installs and
finances projects designed to provide energy at
a contracted level and cost, usually over 7–10
years. Its compensation can be linked directly to
the amount of energy that is actually saved.

Such a risk management framework would
allow energy efficiency experts and investment
decision-makers to exchange the information
they need to expand investment into energy
efficient buildings projects.

Changing behavior
“Culture and Ethics are important considerations.”
Prof Jiang Yi, Tsingua University
speaking at the EEB Beijing Forum

Summary:
• The behavior of occupants in a building can have
as much impact on energy consumption as the
efficiency of equipment.
• User behavior is influenced by economic, social
and psychological factors that influence both the
buying of equipment and the use of energy.
• Energy use is determined by
information/awareness and energy costs, plus
social, educational and cultural factors.
• The rebound effect limits potential energy
savings by substituting new consumption for
some of the energy saved.

Energy has important symbolic and behavioral
aspects that can have as much impact on
consumption as energy efficient equipment
does. 31 In many people’s minds, energy
“rationing” is a negative symbol of hard times,
whereas energy consumption is a sign of
prosperity. Saving energy therefore carries
ambiguous connotations.
In developing countries, using energy can be a
symbol of progress and affluence; social
recognition can come from consumption,
which clashes with saving energy. In the
developed world, it is a commodity that is taken
for granted and its insignificance can lead to
thoughtless waste.
Lifestyle or habit may increase energy
consumption. For example, people tend to
prefer individual houses rather than apartments.
Houses are also getting larger, with fewer people
per household. In the EU, the number of
households increased twice as much as the
population between 1960 and 1990.32

Buying and using equipment
There are two separate aspects of energy
behavior: buying efficient equipment and using
energy efficiently.

In Europe and the US the market for appliances
has changed over the last decade. Despite the
price premium for energy efficient equipment,
there was a switch during the 1990s to buying
more energy efficient appliances.33 The flip-side
of this is the trend to buying more equipment as
people become wealthier: dishwashers, garden
equipment, extra TVs and other consumer
electronics. 34

Barriers to energy efficient buying
and use
The transition to using energy efficiently is
difficult because it requires widespread changes
in habits, ranging from turning off appliances
when not in use to buying more energy efficient
appliances. The balance between technical
solutions for energy efficiency and human
actions for energy efficiency needs to be
weighed system by system.
Energy-saving actions can be influenced by
several factors. Cost is important, especially
energy cost as a share of total expenses, but
information must be available to stimulate
action. Cultural, educational and social factors,
including concern for the environment, also
influence people’s attitudes.
People may fail to buy energy efficient
equipment due to:
•

•

L a c k o f i nf or m atio n on equipment
performance
L a c k o f c o n c er n for energy efficiency –
consumers tend to be more concerned with
criteria such as technical performance,
comfort and aesthetic design
C o st di f f erenc e between standard and
energy efficient equipment – for example,
there has been relatively low uptake of lowconsumption lamps, possibly due to their
higher price.

Several social, cultural and psychological factors
prevent users from making energy savings, as
shown in the Table 2. The figures emphasize
that people generally understand the point of
saving energy and know what to do. Many are
also not put off by the cost or the effort. But
36% do not want to lose comfort; 25% think

their action would be just a drop in the ocean;
another 25% say they cannot afford it, and 22% say
it is too much effort.
Perception is important. People may not have an
accurate understanding of the effort needed to
achieve energy efficiency and the resulting
advantages in terms of energy consumption. In other
words, they may feel too much effort would be
required for too little return.
These barriers to energy efficient behavior are linked
to three issues:
• Lac k of a war eness a nd inform atio n on
energy consumption and cost – people are often
not aware that they are wasting energy – which
prevents them from behaving efficiently.
• Hab it – people are in the habit of leaving lights
on, not adjusting heating and using ovens even
though they consume more energy than
microwaves do.
• The r eb ou nd effect – the reduction of energy
savings because the saving leads to additional
activity through either greater use of the same
product or for another energy-using action, such
as driving a more efficient car further, or leaving
lights on because they are energy-saving bulbs –
is widely recognized but its magnitude varies, for

Space heating: 10- 30%
Space cooling: 0-50%
Lighting: 5-20%
Water heating: 10-40%
Automobile: 10-30%.

Removing the barriers
Consumers tend to want more user-friendly
technologies and economic incentives such
as bonuses for reducing energy use. But
energy efficient behavior can become
almost automatic when trends in lifestyle,
energy efficient technology and behaviors
coincide.26 This emphasizes the importance
of lifestyles and behavior in energy
consumption.
The challenge is to affect behavior
permanently. Information and education
are key elements to change knowledge into
action. This includes advertising campaigns
on energy efficiency, energy labeling of
appliances, advice on energy efficient
equipment or behavior, education at school
and the use of information technologies
such as consumption meters. Expert advice,
through audits, may be necessary to help
people become aware of possible energy
savings and measure the impact of their
behavior.
Technical devices to measure energy
consumption and provide immediate
feedback help households to cut energy
consumption by as much as 20%. 37 Direct
and immediate feedback reveals the link
between actions and their impacts. Wellinformed consumers choose actions to save
energy with minimal impact on their
comfort. Perceptions of comfort are
important; there must be a balance
between energy-saving value and any
perceived loss of comfort. 38

Conclusions and next steps
Technology available today can achieve
dramatic improvements in building energy
efficiency, but market failures and behavioral
barriers are blocking progress toward the EEB
vision of zero net energy. The challenge in this
first phase has been to understand those
impediments. In the next phase the project will
explore ways to overcome them and develop a
roadmap with practical measures that businesses
can implement.

Complexity and segmentation
The building industry and the market are highly
complex. Different approaches will be needed
for different segments and sub-sectors. Each
sub-sector (e.g., offices, hospitals, retail,
apartments, detached houses) may have its own
particular characteristics, and the project will
develop sector-specific analyses in the next
phase. At this stage the conclusions are
concerned with the building market as a whole.

Risks and opportunities
There are market and operational risks for
businesses and there are opportunities. There
will be substantial market demand for energy
efficiency, but the timing and the value
proposition are uncertain. Businesses that enter
the energy efficient building market early could
achieve first-mover advantages.

Barriers
The EEB’s perception research found high levels
of awareness of the issue of sustainable building
but low levels of specific knowledge and
involvement. It identified three key barriers to
implementation:
• Lack of information about building energy
use and costs
• Lack of leadership from professionals and
business people in the industry
• Lack of know-how and experience as too
few professionals have been involved in
sustainable building work.

Use less, make more, share
There are three key elements to achieving zero
net energy:
• Use less energy
• Make more energy (locally)
• Share surplus energy (through an intelligent
grid).
The most significant, long-term gains will come
from using less energy.

Levers for change

Next steps

Appropriate policies and regulations are
necessary to ensure that the right conditions are
in place for the market to work effectively. Given
an appropriate policy framework, there are three
broad business levers that can help remove the
barriers to building energy efficiency:
• Ad o pt a h oli sti c a p pr o a c h. This is
essential to integrate individual technologies
and innovations.
• Ma k e e ner g y i n b u il di ng s m or e
v al u ed by developing incentives, new
commercial relationships and financial
mechanisms, and clearer information about
building energy performance.
• E d u c at e a nd m oti v ate building
professionals and users in order to
encourage behaviors that will respond more
readily to market opportunities and
maximize the potential of existing
technology.

In its next phase, the EEB Project will explore
how these levers can be developed. First, the
group will create scenarios to evaluate paths
toward zero net energy. These will help identify
changes needed in building industry
approaches, finance and behavior that will
create the necessary levers. The EEB will then
develop a preliminary action plan that will be
used to influence policy-makers and
stakeholders. These steps are shown in the
illustration above. In the final phase the plan will
lead to a call for action by all those involved with
the building industry.

About the project
Lafarge and United Technologies Corporation chair the project and the companies shown below make
up the Core Group. They adopted a multi-faceted approach to understanding and analyzing the issues,
including several hearings and meetings with experts. This included commissioning a perception study to
identify the attitudes, knowledge and understanding among professionals and opinion leaders, as well as
the readiness to adopt more sustainable practices. The project focused initially on “vertical” issues: energy,
materials, equipment, and the broad topic of finance, development and operation. Then it developed
ideas and material in the four areas of policy, innovation, finance and behavior.
Outreach to stakeholders in the building industry such as business leaders, government officials and nongovernmental organizations is an important feature of this project. The first major event took place in
Beijing in March 2007. The China Forum was organized jointly with the International Energy Agency.
More than 150 people took part over two days of workshops and plenary sessions, helping us to
understand building energy efficiency issues specific to China. A second Forum took place in Brussels in
July 2007, concentrating on how to drive investments in energy efficiency in existing buildings.
