Why do we have copyright?  Its in our Constitution:  Article 1, sec. 8, clause 8, which states, Congress is: 
[T]o promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors 
the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries. 
 
How do you get something copyrighted?  Its automatic protection.  All you have to do is to satisfy two 
conditions: 

 
 

It has to be an original work of authorship, and 
It has to be fixed in a tangible form 

 
How Long Is Copyright?  It is the life of the author plus 70 years! 
 
What are the rights of the copyright holder? Section 106 of the Copyright Law provides six Exclusive Rights 
of the copyright owner.  The copyright owner controls these exclusive rights:  

  Reproduction rights 
  Distribution rights 
  Public performance rights 
  Public display rights 
  The right to allow derivative works 
  Moral rights [for visual arts] 

 
Who Owns the Copyright?  There are several possibilities: 

  The original creator 
  Work-made-for-hire doctrine may apply: someone is paid to create intellectual property 
 

Institutional policies may apply: some exclusive rights can be shared by the creator and the 
institution 

  A copyright can be transferred to someone else [in whole or in part] 
  N.B.: Students own their works 

 
What is Fair Use?  Fair Use allows for the educational use of someone elses copyrighted material without 
having to get their permission to use it.  The Law allows a limited use and these limitations are defined by 
the Four the Four Factors of Fair Use [Section 107 of the Copyright Law]: 

1.  Purpose: why are you using someone elses stuff? 
2.  Nature: what kind of stuff is it? 
3.  Amount: how much of that stuff are you using? 
4.  Effect: By using that stuff, are you taking any money away from the copyright owner 

Fair Use requires the making of proper copyright attributions and/or bibliographic citations.  For additional 
assistance, please use the Columbia University Fair Use Checklist:

If you do NOT provide proper copyright attributions or bibliographic citations, your use of someone elses 
intellectual property can be [and usually is] construed as being plagiarism.
