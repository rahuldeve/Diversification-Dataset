An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture 

on Global Warming and Climate Change 

 
The farm animal production sector is the single largest anthropogenic user of land, contributing to soil 
degradation, dwindling water supplies, and air pollution. The breadth of this sectors impacts has been largely 
underappreciated. Meat, egg, and milk production are not narrowly focused on the rearing and slaughtering of 
farm animals. The animal agriculture sector also encompasses feed grain production which requires substantial 
water, energy, and chemical inputs, as well as energy expenditures to transport feed, live animals, and animal 
products. All of this comes at a substantial cost to the environment. 
 
One of animal agricultures greatest environmental impacts is its contribution to global warming and climate 
change. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), the animal 
agriculture sector is responsible for approximately 18%, or nearly one-fifth, of human-induced greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. In nearly every step of meat, egg, and milk production, climate-changing gases are released 
into the atmosphere, potentially disrupting weather, temperature, and ecosystem health. Mitigating this serious 
problem requires immediate and far-reaching changes in current animal agriculture practices and consumption 
patterns. 
 
Global Warming and Climate Change 

 
Global warming is one facet of climate change and refers to an average increase in global surface temperature.1 
Climate change, by contrast, refers to statistical changes in weather over time2 and can include long-term 
changes in rainfall, wind, temperature, or other patterns.3 
 
The planet is continually warming. Temperature readings taken around the world in recent decades, as well as 
scientific studies of tree rings, coral reefs, and ice cores, show that average global temperatures have risen 
substantially since the Industrial Revolution began in the mid-1700s.4 This trend has not shown signs of 
stopping. Each of the most recent three decades, the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, has been warmer than the last, 
and than all other decades on record.5 The five warmest years ever recorded have all occurred since 1998, and 
there has been a mean surface temperature increase of about 0.6C (1.08F) in just the last 30 years.6  The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that, relative to 1980-1999 levels, temperatures 
will rise 1.8-4.0C (3.2-7.2 F) by 2090-2099.7,8 
 
The impacts of increasing temperatures are widespread. Worldwide, glaciers are in retreat, the tundra is thawing, 
sea ice is melting, sea level is rising, and some species are rapidly disappearing.9 Sea-ice reductions translate 
into loss of polar bear habitat, putting the species at risk of extinction.10 The U.S. Geological Survey reportedly 
identified a definite link between changes in the sea ice and the welfare of polar bears...As the sea ice goes, so 
goes the polar bear. 11

There have been increasing occurrences of some extreme weather events since 1950. For example, there have 
been more heavy precipitation events, more heat waves, and an expansion of drought-affected areas. Since the 
1970s, there have been increases in hurricane intensity.12 The IPCC further predicts changes to a variety of 
extreme weather events in the future, including the likelihood of more hot nights and more floods in many 
regions.13  
 
Some natural occurrences, such as changes in solar output and volcanic eruptions, can affect climate change;14 
however, the leading international body for the assessment of climate change15 concluded in its Fourth 
Assessment Report (AR4)that a majority of the increase in temperature over the second half of the 20th century 
is likely due to human activities.16,17 In fact, the IPCC* found with high confidence that human-induced 
warming has already impacted many physical and biological systems.18 The panel warned that human-induced 
warming could have abrupt or irreversible effects. 19 
 
Since publication of the AR4, even more evidence has been gathered linking human activity to climate change. 
For example, a 2010 study implicated anthropogenic climate change in Arctic sea-ice reductions, precipitation 
changes on global and regional scales, increased ocean salinity in part of the Atlantic, as well as temperature 
change in the Antarcticthe only continent on which climate change had not been attributed to human influence 
as of the AR4.20 Recent studies are also able to attribute climate change to human influence on increasingly 
smaller scales.21 

 

Beyond the Environment: Drought, Hunger, and Conflict 
 
The effects of climate change vary greatly by region.22,23,24,25 While wealthy, developed countries are mainly 
responsible for the historic buildup of climate changing gases, as well as high per capita emissions,26 leading 
global development organizations recognize that the poor in lower income countries are most vulnerable to 
climate change.27 The IPCC predicts a growth of drought-affected areas, lower water availability for large 
numbers of people, and that events such as heat waves, drought, and storms will lead to more death and disease, 
especially for those not in the position to adapt28such as the more than 1 billion people worldwide who live 
in extreme poverty on less than US$1 a day.29 
 
The poorest of the poor tend to live in high-risk areas, such as coasts, and are less able to withstand the effects of 
climate change on water supplies or food sources.30 Communities reliant on subsistence farming will be among 
the hardest hit. Studies have consistently shown, says Robert Watson, former chair of the IPCC and now a 
senior scientist with the World Bank, that agricultural regions in the developing world are more vulnerable, 
even before we consider the ability to cope.31 Henry Miller of Stanford University has reportedly said that like 
the sinking of the Titanic, catastrophes are not democratic...A much higher fraction of passengers from the 
cheaper decks were lost. Well see the same phenomenon with global warming.32 
 
Drought will bring obvious human suffering. According to the IPCC, by 2020, up to 250 million people may 
experience water shortages, and in some African nations food production could fall by half.33 The IPCC also 
warns that warming temperatures could result in food shortages for 130 million people across Asia by 2050. The 
report suggests that a 3.6C (6.5F) increase in mean air temperature could decrease rain-fed rice yields by 5-
12% in China. In Bangladesh, says the IPCC, rice production could fall approximately 10% and wheat by one-
third by 2050.34

As grazing areas dry up in sub-Saharan Africa, pastoralists will be forced to travel farther to find food and many 
animals will likely starve. In particular, cattle, goats, camels, sheep, and other animals who depend on access to 
grazing areas for food will suffer from hunger and dehydration.35 
 
Conflicts among pastoral communities are also likely to rise along with temperatures. As water supplies dry up, 
farmers and herders are living out an ancient struggle over land and water resources. One startling example is in 
Sudans Darfur region. There, the effects of climate change and population growth, including dwindling water 
supplies and diminishing arable land, have reportedly created an untenable and devastating situation. Farmers 
and herders have taken up arms, fighting to gain and maintain control of increasingly scarce water and land.36 
 
A 2007 report by the UNEP cites environmental degradation as a catalyst for the ongoing conflicts in Darfur and 
other parts of Sudan. Among its critical concerns are land degradation and desertification, which are tied to 
increases in farm animal populations: Vulnerability to drought is exacerbated by the tendency to maximize 
livestock herd sizes rather than quality...In addition, an explosive growth in livestock numbersfrom 28.6 
million in 1961 to 134.6 million in 2004has resulted in widespread degradation of the rangelands.37 An 
almost unprecedented scale of climate change in the region is also a source of conflict due to the stress its effects 
impose on communities whose livelihoods depend on agriculture. 38 
 
Not confined to Sudan, these same battles are being fought with greater frequency in several other African 
nations, including Chad and Niger. 39 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has cited climate change as one factor 
that led to the Darfur conflict40 and also reportedly stated that the danger posed by war to all of humanityand 
to our planetis at least matched by the climate crisis and global warming, noting that global warming can 
lead to natural disasters, trigger droughts, and cause other changes that are likely to become a major driver of 
war and conflict.41 
 
Causes of Global Warming and Climate Change 

 
As discussed, changes in climate can be influenced by both natural and human factors.42 One natural warming 
phenomenon is the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a blanketing effect by which atmospheric 
greenhouse gases keep the earths surface warm. Clouds, aerosols, and parts of the earths surface reflect about 
one third of the suns light that reaches the earth.43 Energy that reaches the earth is absorbed by the surface,44  
and is then re-radiated back towards space as heat energy.45 Greenhouse gases (GHGs), in turn, essentially trap 
some of this re-radiated energy within the atmosphere, raising the earths surface temperatures.46 
 
Three important greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).47 In 
naturally occurring quantities, these gases are not harmful; their presence in the atmosphere helps to sustain life 
on the planet by trapping some heat near the Earths surface. Since the industrial revolution, however, 
atmospheric concentrations of all three of these important GHGs have increased significantly due to human 
activities, contributing to global warming and climate change.48,49 Between 1970 and 2004, greenhouse gas 
concentrations rose about 70%.50 Although the ocean absorbs some of the human-induced carbon emissions,51 
greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise and oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide appears to be slowing.52 
 
While the most important human-influenced GHG may be carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are also 
extremely important for climate change.53 The global warming potential (GWP), or power, and lifetime in the 
atmosphere of each of these gases differs. CO2 has been assigned a value of one GWP, and the warming 
potentials of other gases are expressed relative to its power.54 According to the IPCC, 1 tonne* of methane has 
the warming effect of around 25 and 72 tonnes of CO2 over 100- and 20-year periods, respectively. 55 A 2010 
study shows that methane is likely significantly more potent.56  Further, methanes relatively short atmospheric 
lifetime compared to carbon dioxide ( ten years57,58 vs.  centuries to millenia59) means that reducing methane 
emissions would have a more immediate and significant impact on mitigating climate change than just reducing 
CO2 emissions.60 
                                                 
* One tonne is one metric ton, or 1,000 kg.

Nitrous oxide is another extremely potent greenhouse gas and remains in the atmosphere for 114 years.61,62 N2O 
is 298 times as potent as CO2 over 100 years.63

Animal agriculture is a major emitter of all three of these major GHGs.64 The FAOs November 2006 report, 
Livestocks Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, found that meat, egg, and milk production are 
responsible for an estimated 18%, or nearly one-fifth, of human-induced GHGs.65 
 
The climate changing impacts of the farm animal sector are projected to be significant for decades to come.  A 
2010 study in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences found that, based on projected product 
demand, the sectors GHG emissions may increase 39% by 2050.  This was estimated to account for 70% of 
what is considered a sustainable level of GHG emissions in 2050.  In other words, farm animals alone are 
projected to emit over two-thirds of the amount of GHGs considered safe by 2050.66 
 
Global Farm Animal Populations and Production Practices 

 
Farm animals are significant contributors to the production of all three major GHGs,67 and, as their numbers 
grow, so do their emissions. As the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) notes, GHG emissions from 
livestock are inherently tied to livestock population sizes because the livestock are either directly or indirectly 
the source for the emissions. 68 
 
Globally, according to the FAO, 67.5 billion land animals were raised for human consumption in 2008,69 joined 
by an untold number of aquatic animals. Presently, grazing and mixed farming methods remain widespread in 
Africa and parts of Asia,70 but, beginning in the mid-1980s, the reach of industrialized animal production 
practices extended into less-developed countries.71 Since industrialized systems support much larger numbers of 
animals per unit area than extensive systems,72 a global shift toward industrial production could result in larger 
farm animal populations over all. Globally, industrialized systems now produce over half of all pork and about 
two-thirds of eggs and poultry meat.73 In China, India, and Brazil, for example, producers are increasingly 
favoring intensive, industrial production systems74over more welfare-friendly practices. In recent years, 
industrial livestock production has grown at twice the rate of more traditional mixed farming systems and at 
more than six times the rate of production based on grazing, according to a 2007 report about GHG emissions 
from agriculture.75 
 
This inhumane and environmentally unsustainable trend toward industrial practices views farm animals as 
production units and focuses nearly exclusively on productivity as the sole output of these industries.76 
Emphasizing productivity can often be at odds with animal welfare, as intensified agricultural production 
practices of today typically confine animals in cages, crates, and pens without adequate space for animals to 
experience most natural behavior.77 In addition to these impacts on animal welfare, farm animals are inefficient 
in converting feed to edible protein.78 If animals are considered as  food production machines, a team of 
Swiss and Italian scientists concluded, these machines turn out to be extremely polluting...and to be very 
inefficient.79 
 
Fueling Climate Change: Carbon Dioxide 

 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change

Carbon dioxide is widely considered the most important human-induced GHG.80,81 The release of CO2 into the 
atmosphere due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, has had the largest 
impact on the climate relative to all other factors over the last 250 years,82 and, in 2005, atmospheric carbon 
dioxide levels were 36%, or about 100 parts per million (ppm) higher than 250 years before, rising to 379 ppm.83 
 
CO2 has the most significant anthropogenic warming impact in the atmosphere84 for two reasons: 1) the sheer 
volume of its emissions and 2) its persistence in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for 
centuries or millennia.85 This is such that todays CO2 emissions, including those produced by animal 
agriculture, may remain in the atmosphere in 2100 and beyond.86,87  
 
The farm animal sector contributes approximately 9% of annual anthropogenic CO2 output. The largest sources 
of CO2 from animal agriculture come not from the animals themselves, but from the inputs and land-use changes 
necessary to maintain and feed them.88 
 
Fertilizer and Feed Production 
 
Burning fossil fuel to produce fertilizers used in feed production releases significant amounts of CO2. Indeed, a 
main input in modern farm animal production is artificial nitrogenous fertilizer, vast amounts of which are used 
in the cultivation of farm animal feed.89 This fertilizer is primarily applied to corn, but also to other feedcrops 
like soybeans, barley, and sorghum.90 Worldwide, more than 97% of soymeal and over 60% of barley and corn 
go to feed farm animals.91 
 
Most of that fertilizer is produced in factories dependent on fossil-fuel energy.92 Manufacturing nitrogenous 
fertilizer requires around 1% of the global energy supply,93 and an estimated 41 million tonnes of CO2 is emitted 
each year from fertilizer production exclusively for feed crops.94 
 
China, the worlds largest producer of grain,95 emits the greatest amount of CO2 from this process, releasing 
nearly 14.3 million tonnes annually. The United States, the worlds second-largest grain producer,25 emits just 
under 12 million tonnes, while Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom each emits 2.2-3.3 million 
tonnes of CO2 per year as a result of fertilizer production for feed crops.96 
 
Energy Use 
 
Maintaining intensive animal production facilities, as well as growing the associated animal feed, may emit 90 
million tonnes of CO2 per year due to requirements such as electricity and diesel fuel.97 This is in contrast to 
extensive systems that have low or negligible comparative on-farm fossil fuel use.98 The FAO estimates that on-
farm fossil fuel consumption in intensive systems likely produces more CO2 emissions than does the 
manufacturing of chemical fertilizer for feed production. The fossil fuel needed varies by animal: A typical U.S. 
factory farm in the 1980s used approximately 35 megajoules (MJ) of energy per kg of a chicken, 46 MJ per kg 
of a pig, and 51 MJ per kg of cattle.99 
 
Electricity use in intensive farms makes up a large part of this energy expenditure, especially for ventilating, 
heating, and cooling monogastric operations, such as pig or chicken meat production facilities.100 But, according 
to the FAO, feed production accounts for over half of the energy used for animal agriculture systems.101 This 
does not include the energy used to make fertilizer (discussed above), but the energy used for seed, herbicides, 
and pesticides, as well as the fossil fuel needed for farm machinery used to produce feed.102  
 
Transportation and Processing 
 
As agriculture becomes increasingly globalized, meat, eggs, milk, and live animals are transported farther than 
ever before. Approximately 45 million cattle, pigs, and sheep are traded around the world each year,103 and 
millions more are transported over long distances within a countrys own borders.104 In addition to the human 
health and animal welfare implications of transporting live animals between different cities and countries, and 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change

the potential for spreading animal disease,105 live animal transport likely consumes large quantities of fossil 
fuels and contributes to climate change. 
 
Transporting feed, and processing and transporting animal products, may emit tens of millions of tonnes of CO2 
per year.106 While the FAO did not include consideration of live animal transport in its calculations, its report 
did find that transporting feed and animal products to the destinations where they will be consumed emits 
approximately 0.8 million tonnes of CO2 per year.107  
 
Soybeans and soybean cakes used for feed are shipped from Brazil to Europe, and estimated annual emissions of 
CO2 from just this single trade route are some 32,000 tonnes. The annual trade of meat between countries results 
in 500,000-850,000 tonnes of CO2.108 
 
The FAO estimates that CO2 emissions from animal processing total several tens of millions of tonnes per 
year.109 Processed animal products typically come from intensive systems,110 although energy costs vary widely 
depending on the product.111 Processing meat from sheep, according to one study, is very energy costly, with 
10.4 megajoules (MJ) used per kg of carcass compared to the energy required for processing beef, which uses 
4.37 MJ per kg.112 Processing eggs, too, is energy intensive, with more than 6 MJ used per dozen eggs.113 
 
Changing the Landscape: GHG Emissions from Deforestation, Land Degradation, Soil Cultivation, and 
Desertification 
 
Land uses are continually changing. Around the world, animal agriculture is often an important cause of these 
changes.114 Farm animals and meat, egg, and dairy production facilities cover one-third of the planets total 
surface area and use more than two-thirds of its agricultural land, inhabiting nearly every country.115 As the 
number of farm animals escalates, so do their impacts on forests, soils, and ecosystems. 
 
Expanding farm animal production plays a major role in deforestation, turning wooded areas into grazing land 
and cropland for the production of feed.116 But this destruction comes at a cost beyond the loss of the forests. 
According to the FAO, animal agriculture-related deforestation may emit 2.4 billion tonnes of CO2 into the 
atmosphere each year.117 Tropical forests act as carbon sinks, sequestering carbon and preventing its release into 
the atmosphere.118 Thus, deforestation releases large amounts of carbon, both from soil and vegetation.119 As 
animal product consumption grows, grazing land, soybean monocultures, industrial feedlots, and factory farms 
encroach on forests.120 
 
Animal agricultures role in deforestation has been especially devastating in South America, where expansion of 
pasture and arable land at the expense of forests has been the most prevalent. [T]he continent [is] suffering the 
largest net loss of forests and resulting carbon fluxes, the releases of stored carbon from vegetation and soil 
into the atmosphere.121 
 
In 2005 the FAO found that cattle ranching is one of the main causes of forest destruction in Latin America. The 
FAO predicted that by 2010, more than 1.2 million hectares of forest will be lost in Central America, while 18 
million hectares of South American forest will disappear, in large part, because of clearing land for grazing 
cattle.122 
 
According to a 2004 report by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), rapid growth in the 
exportation of Brazilian beef has accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. The total area of forest lost 
increased from 41.5 million hectares in 1990 to 58.7 million hectares in 2000. In just ten years, reports CIFOR, 
an area twice the size of Portugal was lost, most of it to grazing land.123 In a nutshell, says David Kaimowitz, 
Director General of CIFOR, cattle ranchers are making mincemeat out of Brazils Amazon rainforests.124 
Brazil is the fourth-largest GHG emitter, largely because of agricultural burning in the Amazon, which 
contributes some 70% of the countrys emissions.125

Soybean and corn production for animal feed is also leading to the rapid clearance of tropical forests.126 Mato 
Grosso, the state that has led Brazil in both deforestation and soybean production since 2001,127 lost 
approximately 36,000 km2 of forest to intensive mechanized agriculture between 2001 and 2004.128,129 In just 
five months, from August through December 2007, Brazil lost more than 3,200 km2 of forest in the Amazon at 
least partly due to illegal farming and ranching, as high prices for cattle, soybeans, and corn led farmers and 
ranchers to plant more crops and raise more animals.130,131 Because of this rapid deforestation, in late January 
2008, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva convened an emergency meeting of cabinet ministers to call 
for increased monitoring of the most affected regions.132 
 
Other important ecosystems are jeopardized by soy production, while about 97% of global soymeal goes to farm 
animals.133 According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), half of Brazils soy production occurs in the Cerrado 
region.134 The worlds most biologically diverse savannah, the Cerrado is the size of Alaska and the second-
largest major biome in Brazil.135,136 Nevertheless, it is among the countrys least protected ecosystems.137 
According to WWF, the regions animal species are competing with the rapid expansion of Brazils agricultural 
frontier, which focuses primarily on soy and corn. Ranching is another major threat to the region, as it produces 
almost 40 million cattle a year.138The Cerrados traditional land use of extensive cattle ranching on natural 
pastures maintained most of the regions natural vegetation; however, changes in government policies, including 
credit subsidies for technological advances, have made soybean farming more profitable than extensive cattle 
ranching. Although the Cerrados natural vegetation typically stores less carbon per hectare than a rainforest, 
land use conversion still results in biodiversity losses, increased soil erosion, and substantial carbon 
emissions.139 
 
To address emissions from deforestation, the international environmental organization Greenpeace reportedly 
worked with the McDonalds Corporation to pressure the largest soy traders in Brazil to observe a two-year 
moratorium on the purchase of any soy from newly deforested areas.140 Cargill, the multinational company that 
was supplying McDonalds with Brazilian soy to be used as chicken feed, assisted in persuading fellow soy 
traders to agree to the moratorium. As one Cargill official reportedly noted, The moratorium will give everyone 
time to plan how to better control the farming and protect the forest. 141  But this is a small dent in a much 
larger problem. According to Greenpeace, in 2008, two years after the McDonalds campaign began, 75% of 
Brazils GHG emissions were still coming from deforestation and land-use changes; unsustainable expansions 
of crops like soy, as well as cattle ranching, were at the heart of these emissions, making Brazil the fourth 
largest climate polluter in the world if including land-use change emissions.142,143 
 
 
Like forests, soils can serve as carbon sinks. In fact, the estimated total amount of carbon currently stored in 
soils is 1,100-1,600 billion tonnesmore than twice the carbon in vegetation or in the atmosphere.144 Human 
disturbances (primarily agriculture), however, have significantly depleted the amount of carbon sequestered in 
the soil. The FAO reports that the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), an 
interdisciplinary group of natural and social scientists, estimates that 50% of carbon in soils on the North 
American Great Plains has been lost over the last century due to burning, erosion, harvesting, grazing, or by 
vaporizing into the air.145 The FAO estimates that animal agriculture-related releases from cultivated soils 
worldwide may total 28 million tonnes of CO2 annually.146 
 
In particular, conventional tillage practices (scraping the soil with machinery) both lower the organic carbon 
content of the soil and produce significant CO2 emissions. The FAO estimates that 18 million tonnes of CO2 are 
emitted annually from cultivating corn, soybean, and wheat on approximately 1.8 million km2 of arable land to 
feed animals raised for meat, eggs, and milk.147 
 
The animal agriculture sector can also play a significant role in desertification due to overgrazing and trampling 
of rangelands by farm animals.148 Desertification tends to reduce the productivity and amount of vegetative 
cover, which then allows CO2 to escape. The FAO estimates that animal agriculture-induced desertification of 
pastures may release up to 100 million tonnes of CO2 per year.149

Converting forests to grazing area does not just lead to increased CO2 emissions. Land use changes for animal 
agriculture also greatly reduce methane oxidation by soil micro-organisms such that methane is released into the 
atmosphere rather than being utilized. Grazing lands can even become net sources of methane when soil 
compaction from animal traffic limits the diffusion of gas.150It should be noted, however, that in certain 
grasslands, animal traffic may limit the release of natural nitrous oxide emissions.151 Detailed accounting of 
nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the farm animal sector follows. 
 

Artificial Fertilizer and Manure: Nitrous Oxide Emissions 

 
Nitrous oxide is a GHG of great importance.152 In addition to its large GWP, N2O plays a role in depleting the 
ozone layer. 153 Its concentration in the atmosphere has grown approximately 16% since 1750,154 and the 
molecule persists in the atmosphere for 114 years.155 
 
Animal agriculture accounts for 65% of global anthropogenic N2O emissions.156 Approximately 9% of those 
emissions result from applying artificial fertilizer to feed crops.157 As discussed above, synthetic fertilizer is 
used to produce high-energy, concentrate animal feed, such as corn.158 
 
Farm animal manure also produces nitrous oxide, accounting for nearly 82% of nitrous oxide emissions from 
farm animals globally.159 Animal manure accounts for 6% of U.S. agricultural nitrous oxide emissions.160  
 
In the United States alone, cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and other animals raised on factory farms generate 
approximately 455 million tonnes of manure.161When used to fertilize crops, manure enriches the soil and is a 
key input to healthy, sustainable farms and landscapes. The quantities of manure produced on factory farms, 
however, exceed the amount of land available to absorb it, transforming manure from a valuable agricultural 
resource into hazardous waste that threatens soil, water, and air quality.162 
 
For more information on the environmental and health impacts of factory farm manure and nitrogen fertilizer, 
please see, An HSUS Report: The Impact of Industrialized Animal Agriculture on the Environment. 
 
Ruminant Digestion and Manure Management: Methane 

 
Methane has at least 25 times the GWP of carbon dioxide,163 and its concentrations increased by approximately 
150% between1750 and 2005; in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of methane was about 1775 parts per 
billion, or much higher than the highest levels measured for the last 650,000 years.164 Globally, farm animals are 
one of the most significant sources of anthropogenic methane, responsible for 35-40% of methane emissions 
worldwide.  165,166 
 
Ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, usually have a stomach divided into four chambers167 and emit 
methane during digestion,168 which involves microbial (enteric) fermentation of fibrous feeds and grains.169 An 
adult cow emits 80-110 kg of methane annually.170 Approximately 86 million tonnes of methane are released 
globally each year from enteric fermentation alone.171 
 
Emissions from enteric fermentation vary by country but are significant. In Africa, methane emissions from 
enteric fermentation rose from 190 Teragrams (Tg)* CO2-equivalent per year in 1990 to 222 Tg CO2-equivalent 
per year in 2000 because of a 17% increase in the ruminant population.172 In the U.S., enteric fermentation is 
responsible for about 25% of anthropogenic methane emissions.173 In 2004, estimates for methane emissions 

                                                 
 There are also natural sources of methane, including wetlands, non-wetland soils, termites, oceans, and freshwater bodies.

from enteric fermentation totaled 21.17 million tonnes in Central and South America, roughly 12 million tonnes 
in India, and nearly 9 million tonnes in China. The rest of Asia was responsible for just over 8 million tonnes.174 
 
Methane is also emitted from manure. The FAO shows that pig production contributes the largest share of 
emissions from manure, followed by dairy operations. Methane emissions from pig manure represent nearly half 
of total global farm animal manure emissions. China has the largest country-level methane emissions in the 
world with 3.84 million tonnes; Western Europe produces 4.08 million tonnes, North America 3.39 million 
tonnes, and Central and South America 1.41 million tonnes. 175 In the US, manure management contributes 
about 8% of anthropogenic methane emissions.176 Globally, methane released from animal manure totals nearly 
18 million tonnes annually.177 
 
Between 1990 and 2008, methane emissions from manure management in the U.S. rose 54%, mostly due to 50% 
and 91% rises, respectively, from pig and dairy cow manurean elevation that the nations EPA attributes, at 
least in part, to the shift towards rearing pigs and cows in larger facilities that use liquid manure management 
systems, which have more potential for methane emissions than dry manure management systems.178 
 
Under anaerobic conditions, methane and nitrous oxide are released when bacteria digest animal waste. Most of 
this methane comes from large, open-air lagoon or holding tank systems where farm animal waste is stored 
under anaerobic conditions, and which were developed in the 1960s to manage waste.179 As industrial methods 
of pig and dairy production become the standard worldwide, methane emissions from manure lagoons are likely 
to increase. 
 
Manure that is not stored or managed in lagoon systems, but utilized in a dry form such as in stacks or drylots 
for fertilizer on fields, does not produce significant amounts of methane.180, 181 Storage of manure under 
anaerobic conditionslike those present in lagoonswill produce large amounts of methane but suppress 
nitrous oxide emissions. In contrast, composting and piled storage of manure will promote aerobic 
decomposition, increasing nitrous oxide emissions while suppressing methane emissions.182 
 
 
Mitigating the Animal Agriculture Sectors Role in Climate Change 

 
Direct and immediate actions are required to mitigate and prevent the problems associated with climate change. 
According to the IPCC, a temperature rise exceeding about 3.5C (6.3F) could result in the extinction of 40-
70% of the worlds assessed species.183 Such a rise in temperatures and their devastating impacts are inevitable, 
however, if we continue business as usual.184 Producers, consumers, and policy makers throughout the world 
must examine and respond to the contributions of todays meat, milk, and egg production to GHG emissions and 
climate change. 
 
Transforming Agriculture: Practices to Reduce Impacts 
 
To date, most mitigation and prevention strategies to reduce GHG emissions from animal agriculture have 
focused on technical solutions, such as increasing the efficiency of farm animal production and feed crop 
agriculture. Researchers at several universities are investigating the possibility of reformulating ruminants diets 
with new feeds to reduce enteric fermentation and consequent methane emissions.  
 
The amount of methane produced by animals and their manure is largely determined by the animals feed 
quality, digestive efficiency, body weight, age, and amount of exercise.185,186 In general, lower feed quality 
and/or higher feed intake leads to higher CH4 emissions, and different species and management systems have 
differing feed intakes.187  Cattle confined in feedlots, for example, fed a very high-energy grain diet produce 
manure with a high methane-producing capacity, whereas cattle raised on pasture, who eat a low-energy diet 
of grasses and other forages, may produce manure with roughly 50% of the methane-producing potential 
compared with animals raised in feedlots.188  However, this does not necessarily correlate to greater overall 
GHG emissions per kilogram of product.  For example, one U.S. study found that feedlots resulted in lower 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change

GHG emissions per kilogram of product than that finished by pasture.189 An Irish study, however, found that 
cows raised for beef in an extensive system produced less GHGs per cow and per kilogram of live weight.190 As 
discussed in more detail later, there is not yet a clear answer for what system results in the least overall GHGs 
per kilogram of product. 
 
Increasing the digestibility of pasture for grazing ruminants may be an expedient way of reducing methane 
emissions from enteric fermentation, but this measure must also be accompanied by a reduction in animal 
numbers.191, 192 The European Environment Agency has echoed this sentiment, stating that the main driving 
force of CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation is the number of cattle.193 
 
Another proposed feed-related remedy is a fist-sized, plant-based pill that, along with a special diet and strict 
feeding times, is intended to reduce the methane produced by cattle.194 Winfried Drochner, the lead researcher 
on this supplement, believes that by reducing excessive fermentation and regulating the metabolic activity of 
rumen bacteria, beef and dairy producers can reduce the amount of methane emissions from both the cattle 
themselves and their manure.195 
 
Feed composition is not the only husbandry practice being examined within the climate change context. One 
suggested mitigation strategy to control GHG emissions from beef production is to shorten intervals between 
calving by one month. While this may result in less animal waste and less required feed, as cows would birth the 
same number of calves in a shorter amount of time and be culled at an earlier age,196 it would likely impose 
additional physical stress on the animals and impair their welfare. 
 
Another technical mitigation strategy reportedly being adopted by some large-scale producers is the use of 
anaerobic digesters to isolate the methane from farm animal manure and use it to power generators on-site or 
sell the energy to local electric companies.197  
 
The U.S. EPA estimates that anaerobic digestion systems are feasible at approximately 7,000 pig and dairy 
operations in the United States and, through the AgStar program and the Methane to Markets Partnership, 
provides technical assistance and financial incentives to encourage the use of these systems both domestically 
and globally.198,199 
 
According to the U.S. EPA, existing systems provide enough renewable energy to power more than 20,000 
average U.S. homes and have reduced annual methane emissions by about 1.5 million tonnes of CO2-
equivalent.200 In 2007, the USDA agreed to contribute $1.5 million USD towards manure digester projects at 
three operations in Ohio, which respectively confine 580,000 chickens, 10,000 beef cattle, and 3,800 dairy 
cows.201 Projects in development in Southeast Asia, aided by the World Bank and U.S. EPA, are estimated to 
prevent annual emissions of 4,536 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per 20,000 pigs.202 
 
Despite their benefits for mitigating GHG emissions, this technology is more likely to benefit larger operations 
than smaller-scale farms. According to EnergyBiz Insider, Typically, a minimum herd of 300 dairy cows or 
2,000 swine is needed to make such a system feasible.203 A representative of Microgy, a now bankrupt New 
Hampshire-based company that operated renewable gas facilities using anaerobic digestion of animal and food 
industry waste,204 reportedly echoes the benefits this technology offers to large-scale producers: [T]he market is 
really unlimited. Its only limited by how many cows and hogs you have in feedlots.205 Incentivizing more 
large-scale, industrial production by subsidizing anaerobic digesters also carries with it the threat of growing the 
farm animal population at a rate by which emissions would be greater than without subsidized anaerobic 
digester projects. 
 
Smithfield Foods, the worlds largest pork producer,206 had reportedly invested more resources in biogas 
collection to meet its CCX goals. At its Tar Heel pig slaughtering plant in North Carolina, for example, 
Smithfield is using methane generated by its wastewater treatment system as boiler fuel. In Michigan, the 
company is burning methane from a 10 million-gallon anaerobic manure lagoon in place of using natural gas 
energy. Two of the companys other facilities are also making biofuels out of animal fats and oils.207 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change 

10 

 

 
One Swedish company, Svenska Biogas, is going one step further than manure digesters and extracting residual 
methane from slaughter plant waste such as cows stomachs, intestines, udders, livers, kidneys, and blood. 
Depending on the size of the animal, the company can extract 80-100 kg of methane. Annually, the company is 
making use of 54,000 tonnes of this waste from cows, pigs, and chickens.208 
 
Other agricultural companies are focusing on similar efforts. Seaboard Foods, the second largest U.S. hog 
producer,209 has a long list of environmental initiatives that mainly focus on animal waste treatments but they do 
not seem to be systemized across all of their production farms. These efforts include things such as using animal 
fats to create biodiesel, for which they have even created a corporate subsidiary, High Plains Bioenergy, to 
manage these efforts.210  They also have a seven-stage microbial treatment for animal wastes on at least one 
farm accompanied by planted vegetation around all waste lagoons to improve soil quality.211 Tyson Foods has 
teamed up with oil giant ConocoPhillips and Syntroleum, a fuel technology company, to create renewable diesel 
using fats from beef, pork, and poultry byproducts. Production is expected to yield as much as 662-946 million 
liters per year.212,213 The companies claim their renewable diesel meets all federal standards for ultra-low-sulfur 
diesel. 214 Tyson Foods has aligned themselves with the principles of ISO 14001, the U.S. EPA Climate Leaders 
program, and have even begun using a carbon footprint inventory among other initiatives.  They have also set 
several environmental goals including water conservation, waste reduction, increased recycling, and decreasing 
packaging of their products.215 
 
Some researchers have noted the ostensible resource efficiency of monogastric farm animals like chickens, who 
require less feed, which correlates with lower water, and land use for feed.216 Nonetheless their production still 
has significant environmental impacts, including  methane and nitrous oxide emissions from their manure217 and 
carbon dioxide emissions from the transport of pig and poulty products.218 
 
Developing feedlot rations to reduce emissions from enteric fermentation, using animal waste and carcasses to 
generate fuel, or selectively purchasing feed crops from less devastated forested regions may be innovative ways 
of reducing GHG emissions; however, these strategies do little to address the other environmental problems 
inherent in industrialized meat, egg, and milk production, and may serve to increase the global farm animal 
population and further intensify farming practices, thereby exacerbating the myriad social, environmental, and 
animal welfare problems associated with industrial farm animal production. 
 
Transforming Agriculture: Extensive and Organic Practices 
 
When evaluated purely from a climate change perspective, organic and extensive production systems may be 
more efficient than other systems under some circumstances. Organic agriculture has the potential to sequester 
carbon and mitigate emissions, according to the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements 
(IFOAM).219,220 But there are numerous and conflicting studies on this issue for beef and dairy production. 
 
Multiple studies show organic dairy production is comparable to conventional production in terms of GHG 
emissions. Three European221,222,223 studies all show similar total GHG emissions from varying production 
systems, including organic, extensive, and conventional. A 2010 study modeled emissions from organic and 
conventional farms for four different geographical locations in Austria and found that organic systems emitted, 
on average, 11% fewer GHGs per kilogram of milk than conventional systems.224 Since some of the systems 
used soybean meal from South America, this study took land-use change emissions into account. However, it 
did not evaluate deforestation emissions, which may make organic systems even more efficient relative to the 
conventional systems.225,226 
 

Studies on organic or extensive beef production also show varying results. Some studies indicate the potential 
for organic or extensive production to be as GHG-efficient as conventional production. An early study 
comparing the U.S. intensive feedlot system to an African pastoral system showed that the pastoral system had 
lower emissions per kilogram of product. When accounting for forgone carbon sinks, this difference was even 
greater.227 A study of two German farms with integrated crop production showed that the organic system had 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change 

11 

 

lower emissions over a given area, but emissions from organic production were found to be probably higher 
per kilogram of product.228 This study used a relatively low, German-specific emission factor for methane from 
the slurry manure system in the non-organic farm (15% vs. the suggested IPCC factor of 35% at that time),229 
which, while possibly appropriate given the location, may have influenced results against the organic farm. The 
German study stands in contrast to an Irish study that showed lower emissions per unit product in organic 
production.230 
 
An Australian study published in 2010, which does not appear to account for carbon sequestration potential, 
found varying results both between its study locations and when comparing its results to other studies. For 
example, emissions from beef varied by year and system. A table attempting to compare the results to other 
studies showed widely varying results around the world, with the African pastoral system, from the study 
mentioned above, emitting the lowest amount of GHGs from beef production.231 A comparison of various life 
cycle assessments, however, is problematic.232  
 
A 2010 life cycle assessment of beef production in the Upper Midwestern U.S. found feedlot-finished beef to be 
more GHG efficient per live-weight kilogram than grass-finished beef.233 However, this result can change based 
on the assumptions, and clearly more research is needed. For example, if taking into account certain carbon 
sequestration rates for improved pastures and pastures recently converted to management-intensive grazing, 
the results reverse. In that case, grass-finished beef would be 15% less greenhouse gas intensive than feedlot-
finished beef [].234 Further, this study noted that for all beef production systems the gross chemical energy 
return on investment, i.e. how efficient it is to raise cows for beef, was 2% or less.235 In other words, as the 
authors note: none of the systems analyzed can be described as ecologically efficient relative to most other 
food production strategies.236 
 
While GHG emissions are a key environmental consideration when evaluating different production systems, 
other environmental factors also need to be taken into account. Organic agriculture, for example, has greater 
potential to foster biodiversity than conventional agricultural systems, which rely on more external inputs. 
Organically managed agricultural land tends to be more bio-diverse, supporting a range of grasses and species, 
including songbirds, earthworms, and soil microorganisms.237 
 
It is also important to note that a higher level of animal welfare is associated with organic production.238,239,240 
One dairy life cycle assessment took this directly into account and found that the organic system was preferable 
both to a conventional and extensive system from an animal welfare perspective.241 The 2010 Austrian study 
mentioned above states that [o]verall, pasture-based systems can be considered not only as animal friendly but 
also as favorable from the point of view of GHGE, as they are emitting less GHG than any other housing 
systems.242 
 
Transforming Agriculture: Carbon Offsets and Exchanges 
 
At least two major animal agribusiness corporations hoped to offset their GHG emissions by joining the Chicago 
Climate Exchange (CCX). The Exchange was the worlds first and North Americas only voluntary, legally 
binding GHG emissions registry, reduction, and trading program. Smithfield Foods, the worlds largest pig 
producer, and agribusiness giant Cargill both joined the Exchange in 2007.243,244 In Smithfields 2009/2010 
Annual Report, they announced a 4% decline in overall GHG emissions for 2007 to 2009.245 Cargill boasted a 
7.8% reduction in GHG emissions for 2008, their latest verified reporting year.246 Cargill has also set a goal to 
improve their GHG intensity by 5% by 2015.247 As part of the CCX, Smithfield had the opportunity to purchase 
carbon credits through the CCX Carbon Financial Instrument to meet their target.248 However, Smithfield, 
Cargill and other corporations will now have to set and meet their targets without the help of the Chicago 
Climate Exchange.  The members commitments expired in 2010 and the program was shut down.249 
 
Like carbon trading programs, carbon offsets allow companies and other emitters to compensate for their own 
emissions by investing in measures to reduce emissions elsewhere or to engage in other, unrelated actions to 
prevent, sequester, or displace CO2 emissions.250,251 Criticisms of offset programs abound, chief among them 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change 

12 

 

being the idea that, in some instances, they may only be symbolic, rewarding emitters for measures that would 
have been taken despite participation in an offset program.252,253 
 
Established within the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a funding mechanism 
financed by the international community designed to subsidize offsets and ensure that projects (1) actually 
reduce emissions and (2) are additional activities that would not have otherwise been undertaken.254 For 
example, a power plant in a developed country that finds it difficult to reduce its own emissions can buy credits 
to support new emissions-reducing projects in a developing country like India.  
 
Under the CDM, such projects can earn certified emissions reduction (CER) credits which can be traded and 
sold, and used by industrialized countries to a meet a part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto 
Protocol.255 The signatories to the Kyoto Protocol run the CDM through the CDM Executive Board, which 
oversees these projects.256 One such project was registered in 2006 by V.P. Farms in Thailand, a swine 
production farm.257 Although this project is considered small-scale by CDM standards, V.P. Farms plans to use 
the manure of 88,000 pigs.258 
 
Industrial animal agribusiness corporations in several developing countries have already initiated projects under 
the CDM. For example, one proposed CDM project was for a confined pig production operation in Brazil to 
install anaerobic digesters which could be used to generate electricity from methane.259 However, the animals in 
industrial animal production facilities, whether they install digesters or not, produce large amounts of manure 
and other wastes that have deleterious environmental impacts other than GHG emissions.260,261  Furthermore, in 
Brazil and other parts of South America, tropical rainforest and grasslands are being destroyed by ranching and 
the construction of slaughter plants,262 and for soy production for farmed animal feed. 263,264 
 
Transforming Agriculture: Making Climate-Friendly Food Choices 
 
As consumers become increasingly concerned about climate change and global warming, they are choosing 
more environmentally friendly products, such as energy-efficient appliances, compact fluorescent light bulbs, 
solar panels, and hybrid vehicles. While these are all important measures toward increasing energy efficiency 
and curbing GHG emissions, replacing and reducing animal product consumption are also very effective 
strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change. 
 
Replacing meat, eggs, and dairy products with plant-based foodseven by simply incorporating more animal-
free foods into ones dietis also an effective strategy to reduce GHG emissions from animal agriculture and to 
reduce its other harmful impacts. Numerous studies support this conclusion globally. One study shows that, in 
the U.S., choosing vegetable-based meals over red meat and dairy one day a week is equivalent to driving 1860 
kilometers, or 1160 miles, less per year. The reduction improves to the equivalent of an impressive 13,000 
kilometers, or 8,100 miles, for a complete shift to a vegetable-based diet.265 A 2010 study in Agriculture, 
Ecosystems, and Environment found that the production, processing, transport and preparation of an Indian, non-
vegetarian meal including mutton collectively emitted 1.8 times the GHGs as that of a vegetarian meal without 
dairy products.266 
 
The benefits of choosing more animal-free foods does not end with the climate. A 2007 article in the European 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition notes that vegetarian and vegan diets could play an important role in preserving 
environmental resources and in reducing hunger and malnutrition in poorer nations.267 Similarly, a 2007 
position paper by the American Dietetic Association states that dieticians can encourage eating that is both 
healthful and conserving of soil, water, and energy by emphasizing plant sources of protein and foods that have 
been produced with fewer agricultural inputs.268  
 
Numerous environmental and non-profit organizations echo this call. The Organic Consumers Association 
encourages consumers to seek out locally produced, seasonal organic foods, as well as vegetarian fare to combat 
climate change.269 The Natural Resources Defense Council has released an Eat Green guide that encourages 
people to choose more fruits, vegetables, and grains and to limit red meat consumption.270  Environmental 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change 

13 

 

Defense devotes one page on its website to tips for Fighting Global Warming with Food, primarily addressing 
the benefits of reducing meat consumption.271 Greenpeaces online Green Living Guide includes a piece about 
the environmental impacts of meat production and suggests consumers go vegetarian or simply cut down on the 
amount of animal products you consume.272 
 
Reducing consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products is critical to control GHG emissions from animal 
agriculture and to mitigate its other harmful impacts, especially as we move to the future. In January 2008, IPCC 
Chair Rajendra Pachauri reportedly urged consumers to eat less meat to fight global warming, one among a few 
lifestyle changes he said the IPCC was afraid to advocate earlier.273 As researchers wrote in the American 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2003, skepticism has been directed at supporting the increased demand for 
animal products in the diet of the economically advantaged persons of the world, noting a direct link between 
dietary preference, agricultural production, and environmental degradation.274 Human health, in addition to 
environmental health, also benefits from eating fewer animal products. An article published by The Lancet in 
September 2007 advocates a reduction in meat consumption to 90 g per person per day (roughly the equivalent 
of a single beef hamburger patty), both to reduce GHG emissions and to promote better human health. 
According to the authors, the unprecedented serious challenge posed by climate change necessitates radical 
responses...For the worlds higher-income populations, greenhouse-gas emissions from meat-eating warrant the 
same scrutiny as do those from driving and flying.275 Finally, a 2010 study in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences projected a 39% rise in emissions from animal agriculture by 2050.276 Individuals can help 
mitigate this increase by choosing more plant-based foods. 
 
Accountability of Policy Makers 
 
Governments and international policy makers must better regulate the GHG emissions from industrialized 
animal operations. The U.S. Supreme Court declared in April 2007 that the nations EPA has the authority to 
regulate carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping emissions from vehicles as pollutants.277,278 The same 
regulations should be in place for other sectorsincluding animal agriculturethat emit GHGs into the 
atmosphere. Such policies will require greater and better monitoring of large animal-feeding operations, as well 
as moratoriums on the construction of new industrial farm animal production facilities. 
 
One important policy option is to accurately price environmental services, such as a stable climate and clean air. 
Most frequently natural resources are free or underpriced, which leads to overexploitation and pollution, write 
animal agriculture experts at the FAO, concluding that [a] top priority is to achieve prices and fees that reflect 
the full economic and environmental costs, including all externalities.279 
 
The authors of the FAOs Livestocks Long Shadow call attention to the need to establish accurate pricing 
within the animal agriculture sector by selective taxing of and/or fees for resource use, inputs and wastes.280 
Such a system could reward farmers for environmental services, such as protecting forests and biodiversity, so 
that logging to make land available for grazing cattle or cultivating feed crops is not the only viable financial 
option for ecologically fragile regions. As it stands now, the prices of inputs for raising livestock are relatively 
low, resulting in inefficiencies and overuse. The FAO argues for adequate pricing of resources like water to 
correct the distortion. 281  Policy options for correcting the externalities include compensating producers who 
benefit the environment and taxing those who do not.282 
 
Consider the following example from Costa Rica: According to a 2004 study published in the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sciences, pollination services provided by native bees inhabiting the forest near a 
coffee plantation total $62,000 USD. In other words, the bees from a nearby forest provide a valuable economic 
resource that, until now, had not been quantified. The researchers found that if the forest were used for other 
purposes, the value would be much less. For example, if farmers chose to cut down the trees to raise cattle, the 
total value of that land would be $24,000 USD, two-thirds less than what the forest-dwelling bees provide.283 
 
One form of regulation comes in the form of international agreements. The Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to 
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), was established in 1997 and came into force in 

An HSI Report: The Impact of Animal Agriculture on Global Warming and Climate Change 

14 

 

2005.  The Protocols principal component is the establishment of mandatory targets on GHG emissions.284 It 
also includes market-based mechanisms, such as the CDM, to help countries meet their GHG emissions 
reduction targets.285 
 
The Kyoto Protocol is set to expire in 2012.286 In December 2007, negotiators met in Bali, Indonesia, to begin 
making preparations for a post-Kyoto world.287 The Bali Action Plan, or Bali Roadmap, calls for a number of 
actions to curb climate change.288  
 
In addition to observing and furthering the goals of international agreements, individual nations can begin 
developing their own national and regional policies for emissions reductions that also honor other social goals 
such as animal welfare. 
 
Conclusion 

 
Mitigating the animal agriculture sectors significant yet under-appreciated role in climate change is vital for the 
health and sustainability of the planet, the environment, and its human and nonhuman inhabitants. Reducing 
GHG emissions, especially from animal agriculture, is both urgent and critical. [B]y far the single largest 
anthropogenic user of land and responsible for 18% of human-induced GHG emissions,289 the farm animal 
production sector must be held accountable for its role in the climate crisis.  More innovative approaches in 
animal agricultural practices and management must be actualized by raising awareness and providing price 
incentives for farmers and consumers to embrace more sustainable food systems.  Individually, incorporating 
environmentally sound and animal welfare-friendly practices into daily life, including adopting consumptive 
habits less reliant on meat, eggs, and dairy products, can significantly slow the effects of climate change.
