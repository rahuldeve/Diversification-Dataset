Managing the National Forests through Place-

Based Legislation 

Martin Nie and Michael Fiebig 

 
The  resolution  of  multiple  use  conflicts  through  place-based  (national 
forest-specific)  legislation  has  recently  received  increased  interest.  Most  of 
these  proposals  combine  wilderness  designation,  restoration  objectives, 
economic  development,  funding  arrangements,  and  other  provisions,  in  a 
conservation package to be considered by Congress. Interest in the place-based 
legislative approach is precipitated by numerous factors, including perceptions 
of  agency  gridlock,  problems  related  to  forest  planning,  unresolved  roadless 
and wilderness issues, and the embrace of collaboration. Though the national 
forests  have  a  more  unified  governing  framework  than  other  federal  land 
systems, the U.S. Forest Service has implemented place-based legislation in a 
few  cases.  This  Article  reviews  these  cases,  and  then  presents  a  short  case 
study  focused  on  the  Beaverhead-Deerlodge  Partnership  in  Montana,  which 
has  proposed  a  place-based  bill  currently  being  debated.  A  brief  review  of 
other place-based proposals is also provided. We neither endorse nor oppose 
these proposals at this point. Instead, we ask a series of questions that we hope 
will  help  structure  future  analysis  and  debate  of  place-based  national  forest 
legislation.  We  ask  questions  pertaining  to  governance,  conflict  resolution, 
precedent, wilderness designation, and funding.

INTRODUCTION 

This  Article  analyzes  national  forest-specific  legislation  as  a  way  of 
resolving  multiple  use  conflicts.  Unlike  umbrella  legislation  covering  all 
national  forests,  this  bottom-up,  piecemeal  approach  resolves  conflicts  at  the 
unit-level  via  place-based  (forest-specific)  legislation.1  This  approach,  not 
without  precedent,  often  combines  federal  wilderness  designation  with 
additional  forest-specific  prescriptions  and  management  direction 
in  a 
legislative  package  to  be  considered  by  lawmakers.  Place-based  laws  are 
garnering  new  attention,  particularly  in  Montana  where  the  Beaverhead-
Deerlodge  Partnership  (BDP  or  the  Partnership)  proposal  is  the  most  notable 
and controversial example. 

We examine this approach to national forest conflict by first placing it in a 
larger  political  context.  Several  factors 
to  national  forest 
management  have  created  a  highly  uncertain  and  unstable  environment  that 
makes  legislative  solutions  more  attractive  to  some  interests.  Among  these 

important 

 
1.  We use the popular but imprecise term place-based and the overly-bureaucratic term unit-
 
level interchangeably in this Article. Both refer to laws that are specific to one particular federal land 
unit or national forest, in contrast to system-wide laws and organic legislation.

factors,  perhaps  most  important  is  a  forest  planning  process  that  leaves  most 
interest groups unsatisfied. 

We next examine the place-based approach from a governance standpoint 
and review cases where similar unit-level laws have been used in the past. If 
replicated  more  broadly,  the  place-based  approach  could  make  the  national 
forest system more like the national park and wildlife refuge systems, governed 
as  they  are  by  unit-specific  enabling  laws.  Though  more  unified  than  these 
systems, a number of national forests are subject to place-based laws, and we 
draw some lessons from these cases. 

Part  II  then  introduces  our  case  study:  the  BDP  proposal.  This  Part 
explains the proposals formulation, its major provisions, and its evaluation by 
different  interests.  Personal  interviews  were  conducted  with  Partnership 
members, critics, and others in order to better understand the BDP proposal and 
the context in which it is being offered.2 The review is brief, and we use the 
case mostly as a jumping off point. The story is still unfolding at the time of 
this writing. But whether it succeeds or fails, the BDP proposal raises several 
significant  issues  that  are  manifest  in  other  places  and  venues.  Based  on  our 
research and the interviews conducted for this Article, we suspect that similar 
place-based laws will be offered in the future, and we hope our analysis of this 
case will help guide debates elsewhere. 

In Part III, we ask several questions that should be answered by those in 
support of and opposed to the BDP proposal and the place-based approach in 
general.  Questions  pertaining  to  governance,  conflict  resolution,  wilderness 
designation, precedent, funding, and implementation are asked with the purpose 
of  sharpening  future debate.  Though  we are  sometimes  skeptical of  the BDP 
proposal,  we  do  not  dismiss  it  outright.  It  is  best  viewed  as  a  pro-active, 
constructive  response  to  a  dysfunctional  status  quo.  But  caution  is  in  order 
because of the precedent that could be set by the BDP approach. Finally, in Part 
IV, we explore alternative ways in which to experiment with governance of the 
national forests. 

I.  BACKGROUND 

A.  Context 

We begin by placing the case study in a very general political context. A 
few key factors are helpful in understanding the reasoning behind place-based 
national forest legislation and its evaluation by different interests. These factors 
include a rampant frustration with the United States Forest Service (USFS) and

transcribed. Participants were granted confidentiality, so their identities are not revealed and interviews 
are not cited. Questions pertaining to the BDP in particular, and place-based legislation in general, were 
asked  of  all  participants.  The  initial  round  of  formal  interviews  was  followed  by  several  additional 
inquiries and conversations with those involved in place-based forests proposals throughout the West.

roadless  areas  and  motorized  recreation,  and

background and analysis in Parts II and III. 

trends 

First,  the  obvious:  there  is  a  tremendous  amount  of  political  and  legal 
conflict over national forest management. Several long-running conflicts mire 
the  USFS  in  appeals  and  litigation  with  challengers  from  all  sides  of  the 
political spectrum. A cumulative body of environmental law provides litigators 
numerous substantive and procedural tools that are regularly used to challenge 
agency  decisions.3  The  USFS  argues  that  its  multiple  analytical  obligations, 
along  with  a  barrage  of  lawsuits,  among  other  factors,  amount  to  a  process 
predicament  resulting  in  analysis  paralysis.4  A  surprising  number  of 
interests express concern about the inability of the agency to get things done
though  people  differ  about  what  causes  the  situation  and  what  work  needs 
doing  exactly.5  A  deep  sense  of  frustration  with  the  current  state  of  national 
forest  management  was  made  explicit  by  most  of  those  interviewed  for  this 
Article. The USFS, according to some interests, is a paper tiger which often 
cannot be relied upon to get on the ground and do needed work, even when 
that  work  has  broad-based  support.  As  shown  below,  this  shared  frustration 
helps explain the formation of the BDP and the key provisions of its proposal. 

The  agencys  broad  statutory  mandate  helps  explain  why  administrative 
rulemakings  and  forest  planning  processes  are  the  dominant  ways  in  which 
political choices have been made in the past. Until two recent Supreme Court 
cases and subsequent changes to the implementing regulations, national forest 
plans,  written  in  accordance  with  the  National  Forest  Management  Act 
(NFMA),6  were  viewed  as  the  place  where  the  USFS  made  some  important 
resource  allocation  decisions.  It  was  in  this  planning  venue  that  political 
interests and the agency negotiated the general direction of each national forest, 
including some details about how they would be managed over a ten- to fifteen-
year time frame, and with significant implications for potential inclusion in the 
National Wilderness Preservation System.7

of  failing  to  fully  fund  forest  plans.9  And  because  of  the  inadequacy  of 
resources, forest plans became viewed in some respects as more of a contingent 
wish  list  than  a  secure  commitment.  Nonetheless,  forest  plans  were  typically 
viewed as important documents that guided and constrained subsequent agency 
actions while also holding the USFS accountable to some degree.10 Few were 
enamored  with  the  process  and  its  implementation,  but  participants  generally 
understood its overall purpose and utility. 

NFMA  created  a  three-tiered  regulatory  approach  to  planning.11  At  the 
highest level, national-level regulations govern the development and revision of 
second-tier  forest  plans.  Site-specific  plans  make  up  the  third  tier,  and  they 
must  be  consistent  with  both  sets  of  higher-level  regulations.  Forest  plans 
typically make zoning and suitability decisions and limit and regulate various 
activities  within  a  forest  area,  therefore  acting  as  a  gateway  through  which 
subsequent project-level proposals must pass. They do not, however, authorize 
or  mandate  site-specific  projects.  Instead,  plans  address  issues  such  as  the 
prioritization of various multiple use goals, the determination of which land is 
suitable  for  timber  cutting  along  with  allowable  volume,  and  the  choice  of 
harvesting and regeneration methods. 

However,  the  purpose  of  planning  is  no  longer  clear  because  of  two 
significant  Supreme  Court  decisions  and  subsequent  planning  regulations 
promulgated in 2005 and 2008. In Ohio Forestry Association v. Sierra Club the 
Supreme  Court  ruled  that  forest  plans  are  generally  not  ripe  for  judicial 
review.12 Forest plans, said the Court, do not command anyone to do anything 
or to refrain from doing anything; they do not grant, withhold, or modify any 
formal  legal  license,  power,  or  authority;  they  do  not  subject  anyone  to  any 
civil  criminal  liability;  they  create  no  legal  rights  or  obligations.13  With 
exceptions,  such  as  an  agency  decision  to  allow  some  types  of  uses  in  a 
particular area, citizens cannot legally challenge the general direction set forth

that the agency will promulgate plans so general as to be meaningless as limitations on or guidelines for 
subsequent  management  decisions.  Id.  Commodity  interests  have  also  sought  some  certainty  and 
guarantees in forest plans. See, e.g., Wind River Multiple-Use Advocates v. Espy, 835 F. Supp. 1362 (D.

them.17  The  case  focused  on 

The purpose of federal lands planning took a more serious blow from the 
Supreme Court in Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Association (SUWA).16 
In this decision, the Court ruled that a land use plan is generally a statement of 
priorities;  it guides  and  constrains  actions,  but  does  not  (at  least  in  the  usual 
the  Bureau  of  Land 
case)  prescribe 
Managements  (BLM)  contested  management  of  off-road  vehicles  (ORV)  in 
wilderness study areas in Utah.18 Congress directed the agency to manage these 
areas  in  a  manner  so  as  not  to  impair  these  areas  until  it  makes  a  final 
decision  about  their  wilderness  status.19  SUWA  argued  that  these  areas  were 
being impaired, despite promises made by the BLM in its land use plans for the 
area.20 The Court held that the BLMs failure to actto prevent impairment
was  not  a  sufficiently  discrete  action  warranting  judicial  review.21  The 
agency,  said  the  Court,  has  considerable  discretion  in  choosing  how  to  meet 
this legal requirement, despite what is stated in a land use plan.22 

The USFS enthusiastically embraced these two decisions and used them to 
partly  justify  its  paradigm  shift  in  land  use  planning.23  The  agencys 
2005/2008 planning regulations are based on the idea that plans are strategic 
and  aspirational  in  nature  and  do  not  generally  bind  the  agency  to  a  future 
course  of  action.  (The  2008  regulations  are  basically  the  same  as  the  2005 
planning regulations, though the later iteration went through the NEPA process, 
as ordered by a District Court).24 Forest plans written in accordance with the 
2008  regulations,  then,  are  not  decision-making  documents  per  se,  but  rather 
one  tentative  step  in  a  more  adaptive  planning  process.  More  generally,  the 
regulations  should  be  viewed  as  an  effort  by  the  USFS  to  reclaim  the 
administrative discretion it once enjoyed. 

The USFS uses the Ohio Forestry and SUWA decisions to insulate itself 
from judicial challenge to all sorts of agency actions.25 Consider management

of wilderness study areas in Montana.26 In 1977, Congress passed the Montana 
Wilderness Study Act to provide for the study of certain lands to determine 
their  suitability  for  designation  as  wilderness.27  The  Act  mandates  that  the 
Secretary  of  Agriculture  shall,  until  Congress  determines  otherwise, 
administer specific wilderness study areas to maintain their presently existing 
wilderness  character  and  potential  for  inclusion  in  the  National  Wilderness 
Preservation  System.28  Following  SUWA,  the  Supreme  Court  vacated  an 
earlier  Ninth  Circuit  decision  holding  that  the  USFS  had  a  nondiscretionary 
duty to maintain the wilderness characteristics of these areas.29 In the wake of 
this  decision,  it  is  unclear  how  the  USFS  can  be  held  accountable  to  the 
congressional mandate provided by the Montana Wilderness Study Act. 

Taken  together,  these  judicial  decisions  and  planning  regulations  have 
created  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty  among  the  various  interests  and  groups 
engaged in forest planning processes. As explained below, several actors want 
more  certainty  and  predictability  than  strategic  and  aspirational  plans  can 
offer.  Since  its  inception,  the  USFS  has  fought  for  maximum  levels  of 
administrative  discretion,  and  when  it  comes  to  planning,  the  courts  appear 
willing to grant it.30 But as will be shown, such freedom comes with risks: in 
this  case,  the  prospect  of  citizens  looking  to  control  the  agency  through 
legislative means. 

The administrative discretion afforded to the USFS certainly contributed 
to the formation of the BDP proposal. However, even more important to this 
story is the history of wilderness designation in Montana and recent trends in 
wilderness  law.  In  many  respects,  the  interest  in  place-based  legislation 
represents a new chapter in wilderness politics and strategy. There are roughly 
3.4  million  acres  of  federally  protected  wilderness  in  Montana.31  But  unlike 
most  other  Western  states,  Congress  never  passed  a  statewide  Montana 
wilderness  bill.  In  fact,  1983  marked  the  last  time  a  wilderness  area  was 
designated  in  the  state.32  As  a  result,  roughly  6.4  million  acres  of  USFS

inventoried  roadless  lands  in  Montana  hang  precariously  in  the  balance  and 
have been subjected to the roller coaster ride of the USFSs roadless rule.33 

Wilderness advocates are divided over how to break the impasse created 
by the USFS roadless rule. Some groups have advanced cleaner large-scale 
wilderness  proposals,34  while  other  groups  supporting  more  targeted  place-
based bills containing wilderness protection and other provisions (as discussed 
in Part II).35 Many agree, however, that there is some urgency to resolving the 
wilderness issue. Motorized vehicle use in national forests is increasing,36 and 
several conservationists in the state now believe that motorized vehicle use has 
eclipsed logging as the greatest threat to wilderness. Conservationists fear that 
these  machines  will  increasingly  intrude  into  potential  wilderness  areas  and 
make  their  protection  more  difficult  in  the  future  because  of  associated 
impairments  and  purported  evidence  of  historic  use.  The  USFS  considers 
historic use of motorized recreation in making its wilderness recommendations. 
In its evaluation of wilderness suitability, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National 
Forest  (BDNF)  states  that  [m]otorized  travel  is  the  activity  most  likely  to 
reduce Wilderness characteristics.37 Consider also the scope of the problem. 
For  example,  within  Montanas  six  million  acres  of  USFS  roadless  areas, 
motorized use is permitted on between three and four million.38 The USFS also 
permits motorized use within some areas recommended for wilderness.39

determine  future  wilderness  designation.  Id.  Historic  use  arguments  have  also  been  used  with  some

  According  to  the  USFS,  there  are  lands  within  Inventoried  Roadless  Areas,  recommended

wheeled cross-country travel yearlong. This amounts to roughly 3.4 million acres of inventoried roadless 
areas,  169,000  acres  of  Forest  Plan  Recommended  Wilderness  Areas,  and  430,000  acres  of  Montana

Also pertinent to the case study and its public reception is the widespread 
embrace of collaborative conservation and trends in cooperative federalism and 
devolution.  The 
language  and  application  of  more  collaborative  and 
decentralized  approaches  is  pervasive  in  natural  resources  management.  On 
numerous occasions, former adversaries have eschewed the courts and familiar 
venues  of  conflict  resolution  in  favor  of  more  cooperative,  broad-based,  and 
win-win  solutions.40  The  national  forests  have  provided  fertile  ground  for 
this movement. Not only does the agency extol the advantages of collaboration 
and  pre-decisional  dialogue,41  but  so  too  have  an  assortment  of  respected 
conservation  leaders  voiced  their  support  for  working  more  collaboratively 
with  the  agency  and  commodity  interests.42  The  BDP  is  often  viewed  and 
debated  in  this  context,  with  some  proponents  of  the  proposal  selling  it  as  a 
collaborative  model  that  finally  resolves  several  conflicts,  and  detractors 
criticizing  it  as  an  exclusive  group  of  narrow  interests  sacrificing  the  federal 
lands for more parochial concerns. 

Closely  aligned  with 

the  Bush 
Administration advanced, albeit selectively, a more decentralized approach to 
federal lands management, with state and local governments given a larger role 
to  play.43  There  is  no  better  example  of  this  move  towards  cooperative 

the  collaborative  philosophy,

federalism 
to  roadless  area 
management.  It  replaced  Clintons  purported  top-down  and  one-size-fits-
all  roadless  rule44  with  a  state-petitioning  process  that  allowed  states  to 
petition the federal government for how they would like roadless areas in their 
states  to  be  managed.45  The  2005  rule  emphasized  the  importance  of  the 
locality: Collaborating and cooperating with States on the long-term strategy 
for the management of [roadless areas] would allow for the recognition of local 
situations  and  resolution  of  unique  resource  management  challenges  within  a 
specific State.46 

Idaho took full advantage of this opportunity and submitted a petition, to 
be implemented by the USFS, directing how 9.3 million acres of inventoried 
roadless  areas  in  Idaho  were  to  be  managed  in  the  future.47  Idahos  roadless 
rule  shares  some  important  characteristics  that  define  other  place-based 
proposals, as outlined below, with one difference being its administrative rather 
than legislative basis. Though several conservation groups supported the Idaho 
roadless  rule,  it  was  subsequently  challenged  in  Court  by  an  assortment  of 
conservation groups who oppose the state petitions approach in general and the 
Idaho  rule  in  particular.48  As  discussed  below,  place-based  approaches, 
especially  when  they  involve  inventoried  roadless  areas  protected  under  the 
2001 rule, have deepened divisions in the conservation community.49 

The  roadless  story,  and  others  like  it,  are  important  to  our  case  study 
because they represent a noticeable shift in federal lands management. Political 
interests  in  Montana,  like  elsewhere,  regularly  view  collaborative  and 
decentralized  strategies  as  viable  options  that  can  be  pursued  when  deemed 
advantageous.50  And  those  strategies  most  sympathetic  to  state  and  local 
interests have had a relatively friendly reception by the executive branch. The

This  Part  reviews 

legislative  approach 

to  forest 
management  from  a  governance  perspective.  It  first  briefly  reviews  how 
national  forests  are  governed  in  contrast  to  the  national  parks  and  wildlife 
refuges.  We  do  this  because,  in  one  way,  the  possible  move  toward  national 
forest  unit-level  legislation  is  similar  to  national  park  and  refuge  enabling 
legislation.  The  Part  then  complicates  this  simple  comparison  by  reviewing 
examples  of  national  forests  already  governed  by  place-specific  legislation. 
This  statutory  review  tells  us  that  the  BDP  proposal,  and  other  place-based 
legislative packages, are not altogether novel. 

1. Overarching National Forest Laws in Comparison to the National Parks and 
Wildlife Refuges 

Three laws are central to understanding national forest management: the 
1897  Organic  Act,51  the  Multiple  Use  Sustained  Yield  Act  (MUSYA)  of 
1960,52 and NFMA, enacted in 1976.53 The 1897 Organic Act states in part that 
[n]o  national  forest  shall  be  established,  except  to  improve  and  protect  the 
forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of securing favorable conditions 
of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and 
necessities  of  citizens  of  the  United  States  .  .  .  .54  This  broad  mandate 
establishes an ongoing tension because some interests emphasize the protect 
and  water  flows  provisions  while  others  highlight  the  supply  of  timber 
component.55 

In  1960,  Congress  added  MUSYA  to  the  Organic  Act.56  Through 
MUSYA,  Congress  formally  articulated  the  multiple  use  mission  of  the 
Service:  .  .  .  [i]t  is  the  policy  of  the  Congress  that  the  national  forests  are 
established  and  shall  be  administered  for  outdoor  recreation,  range,  timber, 
watershed,  and  wildlife  and  fish  purposes.57  There  is  relatively  little  in 
MUSYA directing or constraining forest managers, and its flexibility has been 
 
 
 
 
 
(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C.  475 (2000)). 
55.  What  Congress  intended  by  the  USFS  Organic  Act  has  been  open  to  some  interpretation 
 
throughout  the  years.  See  United  States  v.  New  Mexico,  438  U.S.  696,  71925  (1978)  (Powell,  J., 
dissenting  in  part)  (highlighting  Congressional  intent,  as  embodied  within  the  USFS  Organic  Act,  to 
protect more than simply water flows and timber supplies).

used by the USFS over the years to defend everything from designating 58.5 
million  acres  as  protected  roadless  areas58  to  proposing  an  8.7  billion  board 
foot timber sale in the Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska.59 

High profile conflicts on Montanas Bitterroot National Forest and West 
Virginias  Monongahela  National  Forest  triggered  what  eventually  became 
NFMA.60  It  is  primarily  a  planning-based  statute  calling  for  interdisciplinary 
forest  planning  processes  and  opportunities  for  public  participation.61  It 
provided  stronger  protection  of  non-timber  resources.  Important  prescriptions 
are  found  in  the  Act,  including  clearcutting  guidelines  and  restrictions  on 
timber  harvesting,62  and  a  mandate  to  provide  for  diversity  of  plant  and 
animal communities,63 among other enforceable standards. 

NFMAs  implementing  regulations  have  historically  provided  additional 
substantive  and  procedural  obligations,  such  as  implementing  NFMAs 
diversity  mandate  by  ensuring  wildlife  viability.64  The  rewriting  of  these 
regulations has been controversial, and the 2000, 2005, and 2008 versions were 
legally  challenged  by  commodity  and  environmental  interests.65  Because 
NFMA  did  not  answer  some  central  questions  about  the  appropriate  balance 
and intensity of uses on national forests, conflict has shifted to the regulatory 
and planning arenas.66 And while discretion once gave the USFS authority to 
manage federal forest lands without much challenge, it now leads to numerous 
lawsuits and administrative appeals because many interest groups believe that 
USFSs actions are inconsistent with congressional direction.

strong disparities of opinion can have a debilitating effect on the USFS, whose 
personnel also differ on what uses should be prioritized by the agency.68 

The open-ended nature of these laws also leaves the USFS susceptible to 
executive-level pendulum swings, with the agency being whipsawed back and 
forth  depending  on  who  controls  the  White  House.  The  intractable  nature  of 
several  forest  policy  conflictsfrom  the  roadless  rule  to  forest  planning 
regulationscan  be  partly  understood  in  this  context,  as  one  Administration 
negates  the  workings  of  the  last.  Abrupt  changes  in  policy  direction  make  it 
difficult for USFS personnel to implement these executive-based initiatives and 
goals and leave the agency open to criticism that it is without direction and a 
clear sense of purpose.69 

These core forestry laws are supplemented with dozens of others that are 
substantive  and  procedural  in  nature,  such  as  NEPA  and  the  Endangered 
Species Act (ESA).70 As in other federal land systems, different national forest 
units  may  be  encumbered  with  significantly  different  legal  responsibilities. 
Some  national  forests,  for  example,  have  listed  species,71  water  rights 
compacts,72 tribal treaty obligations,73 and special planning prescriptions, such 
as  the  Northwest  Forest  Plan,74  that  necessitate  very  different  types  of 
management.  But  aside  from  these  differences,  most  think  the  system  is 
relatively consistent, so that national forests are all generally governed under 
the rubric of multiple use, sustained yield, and other vague principles. In most 
cases, differences in management emerge, not from legislation, but out of the 
universal planning processes that are required of each forest. 

The  relatively  unified  national  forest  system  is  quite  different  from  the 
national park and wildlife refuge systems. National parks are usually governed 
by two sets of law: the mandate found in the National Park Service Organic Act

of  191675  and  the  site-specific  enabling  legislation  controlling  how  one 
particular park unit is to be managed. So, for example, Glacier National Park is 
governed  by  the  preservation/recreation  mandate  spelled  out  in  the  1916 
Organic  Act76  and  also  by  more  specific  provisions  found  in  its  1914 
establishment legislation.77 The 1872 enabling law establishing Yellowstone 
National Park provides another historical reference of place-based legislation.78 
These  enabling  acts  are  important  because  their  place-specific  purposes  and 
mandates  are  often  given  priority  by  Congress  and  the  courts,  meaning  that 
site-specific  provisions  trump  those  expressed  in  the  more  general  Organic 
Act.79  Further,  enabling  acts  can  be  quite  detailed  in  how  Congress  wants  a 
particular  park  unit  managed,  thus  limiting  managerial  discretion  in  many 
cases.80 All sorts of substantive and procedural mandates and exemptions are 
written  into  these  enabling  acts,  such  as  grazing  provisions,  consultation 
requirements, and basic zoning and management decisions.81 

National  wildlife  refuges  are  governed  similarly  in  this  regard.82  This 
system is characterized by a tiered-use framework in which a hierarchy of uses 
is used to make refuge management decisions.83 At the top of this hierarchy are 
the purposes for which an individual refuge was created: [T]he conflict shall 
be resolved in a manner that first protects the purposes of the refuge, and, to the 
extent practicable, that also achieves the mission of the System.84

This tension aside, the national park and refuge systems provide an opportunity 
to rethink traditional approaches to multiple use conflicts on national forests. 
Not  only  is  Congress  capable  of  speaking  with  more  clarity,  but  it  can  also 
legislate different approaches to different places and units of public lands on an 
individualized basis. 

2.  Examples of Place-Based Legislation 

At  first  blush,  then,  it  appears  simple:  the  national  forest  system  is  a 
unified  and  rather  homogenous  system  governed  by  a  core  statutory 
framework. But upon closer inspection, this simple comparison becomes more 
complicated. There are, in fact, some national forests and national forest areas 
that  are  currently  governed  by  place-specific  laws,  and  they  offer  some 
valuable  lessons  that  we  will  consider  in  Parts  III  and  IV.  This  Part  reviews 
four  basic  types  of  place-based  forest  laws  already  on  the  books:  (1)  forest-
specific legislation like that governing the Tongass National Forest and part of 
the  Sierra  Nevada,  (2)  forest-specific provisions and exemptions provided by 
Congress via the appropriations process, (3) individually tailored protected land 
designations, and (4) federal wilderness laws. 

Let us start with the most contested national forest in the system: Alaskas 
Tongass National Forest. It is governed by a complicated patchwork of national 
and Alaska-specific laws.89 For years this National Forest, under the terms of 
the  Alaska  National  Interest  Lands  Conservation  Act  of  1980,  was  provided 
forty  million  dollars  annually  in  order  to  supply  a  congressionally  mandated 
450 million board feet of timber for sale each year, regardless of cost or market 
demand.90 

89.  See  generally  Martin  Nie,  Governing  the  Tongass:  National  Forest  Conflict  and  Political 

This  mandated  cut  caused  enormous  environmental  problems  that  were 
addressed  by  the  Tongass  Timber  Reform  Act  (TTRA)  of  1994.91  The  law 
designated parts of the Tongass as wilderness and codified a protective land use 
designation used in the Tongass Forest Plan.92 The TTRA brought the Tongass 
closer in line with other national forests. But unlike other national forests, the 
TTRA  mandates  that  the  Tongass  seek  to  meet  market  demand  for  timber.93

92.  The TTRA directs the Secretary to manage in perpetuity lands designated in Tongass Forest 
 
Plans as Land Use Designation II (LUD II). Pub. L. No. 101-626,  201, 104 Stat. 4426, 4429 (1990). 
These congressionally protected LUD II lands are generally to be managed in a roadless state to retain 
their wildland character. See S. REP. No. 101-261, at 15 (1990). 
93.  Subject  to  appropriations,  other  applicable law,  and  the  requirements  of  [NFMA],  .  .  .  the 
 
Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with providing for the multiple use and sustained yield of all 
renewable forest resources, seek to provide a supply of timber from the Tongass National Forest which

[Vol. 37:1 

This Tongass-specific provision has been endlessly debated and litigated, partly 
because  it  must  be  balanced  with  nation-wide  environmental  safeguards  that 
were  also  secured  by  the  TTRA.94  The  seek  to  meet  market  demand 
provision was designed to give the USFS more discretion than it had under the 
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and its requirement to harvest 
so many board feet per year.95 The TTRA, said the Ninth Circuit, envisions 
not an inflexible harvest level, but a balancing of the market, the law, and other 
uses, including preservation.96 

The  USFS  is  responsible  for  interpreting  the  Tongass-specific  market 
provision  and  determining  how  to  balance  it  with  its  more  general  statutory 
obligations.97  But  many  interests  are  unsatisfied  with  the  agencys  balancing 
act. Some timber interests, for example, want the market demand provision to 
be more aggressively implemented, with the USFS offering a predictable and 
steady stream of timber in order to create and sustain a large integrated wood 
products industry in the region.98 Conservationists, on the other hand, contend 
that  the  agency  mistakenly  prioritizes  the  market  demand  provision  to  the 
detriment of its other legal responsibilities, from ensuring wildlife diversity to 
providing  opportunity  for  Native  subsistence.99  In  typical  fashion,  Congress 
added to the USFSs responsibilities with the TTRA with the expectation that 
the law would be seamlessly integrated with others. But the fit has not always 
been so snug. 

The challenge of reconciling forest-specific provisions with existing laws 
and processes also characterizes another controversial place-based forest law: 
the  Herger-Feinstein  Quincy  Library  Group  Forest  Recovery  Act  (Herger-
Feinstein Act).100 The Quincy Group formed as a way to promote ecological 
sustainability  and  community  stability  in  the  Sierra  Nevada  of  northern 
California.101  The  group  wrote  a  community  stability  proposal  directing 
management of the Lassen, Plumas, and part of the Tahoe National Forests.102 
With  the  USFS  unable  or  unwilling  to  adopt  the  proposal,  the  group  took  to

Washington and succeeded with passage of the Herger-Feinstein Act.103 This 
law required the pilot project to be consistent with applicable federal laws but 
also provided place-specific direction regarding how these national forests must 
be managed in terms of timber targets, fire, roadless areas, and other issues.104 
Implementing  this  place-based  law  has  proven  problematic.  These 
difficulties arise in part because of ongoing concerns about how to integrate the 
Herger-Feinstein  Act  into  the  larger  Sierra  Nevada  Framework,105  a  very 
politicized  region-wide  forest  planning  initiative.106  Important  differences 
between  the  Herger-Feinstein  Act  and  the  Sierra  Framework,  from  fire  and 
fuels  management  to  old  growth  preservation,  set  the  stage  for  future 
conflict.107  And sure  enough, when the  2001  Sierra  Nevada  Framework  plan 
reduced the level of timber cutting allowed in Quincy area forests, the Quincy 
Grouponce the poster-child of collaboration108took to the courts arguing 
that  their law  was  being  subordinated.109  On  the other  hand,  several projects 
initiated by the USFS that are designed to implement the Herger-Feinstein Act 
have  been  administratively  appealed  and  litigated  by  several  environmental 
groups,  thus  frustrating  the  laws  implementation.110  The  question  of  how  to

how  to  do  it,  often  for  a  specified  amount  of  time.  Rather  than  through 
traditional  legislative  channels,  Congress  controls  management  through  the 
appropriations process, often via policy riders.113 Examples abound, such as the 
series  of  riders  on  interior  appropriations  bills  that  allow  the  Secretary  of 
Agriculture to renew grazing permits before NEPA reviews are completed.114 
Perhaps most notable was the infamous salvage timber rider that exempted 
several national forests in the Pacific Northwest from environmental review.115 
Such  riders  are  often  controversial  because  they  make  special  provisions  or 
exemptions  for  one  national  forest.  When  viewed  in  this  light,  place-based 
legislation is not nearly as uncommon as first assumed. Congress has regularly 
intervened in the management of national forests, it has just done so most often 
by using, and sometimes abusing, the appropriations process. 

Protected land and wilderness laws provide additional examples of place-
based, or unit-level legislation. Consider, for example, USFS-managed national 
monuments  like  Admiralty,116  Giant  Sequoia,117  and  the  Santa  Rosa-San 
Jacinto Mountains.118 Like the laws described above, they have unique place-
based governing authorities. So too do USFS-administered national recreation 
areas and other specially-designated landscapes.119 The oldest, perhaps, is the 
Bull Run Watershed Management Unit in the Mount Hood National Forest, in 
Oregon, which was reserved in 1892 and given further legislative protection in 
1904.120  Watershed  protection  and  restoration  is  also  the  goal  of  the  Lake

Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000, which enables the USFS to plan, implement, 
and pay for various restoration projects in the area.121 

More  numerous  are  statewide  or  place-specific  laws  establishing  federal 
wilderness  areas.  While  federal  wilderness  areas  are  generally  managed  in 
accordance with the Wilderness Act of 1964,122 place-specific wilderness laws 
typically  contain  an  assortment  of  special  management  provisions  and 
exemptions that are applicable to one unit.123 The USFS is often responsible for 
managing one wilderness area differently than another, and some wilderness-
eligible  USFS  land  is  also  controlled  by  place-based  laws  directing  interim 
management.  For  example,  the  Montana  Wilderness  Study  Act  requires  the 
USFS to manage selected inventoried roadless areas in a particular way until 
Congress decides whether to designate them as wilderness.124 

Federal  wilderness  laws  have  also  come  bundled  with  complementary 
designations specifying how adjacent lands must be managed in the future.125 
Various  special  designations  have  been  used  in  the  past,  but  each  essentially 
removes  a  landscape  from  discretionary  USFS  management  by  directing  the 
agency to manage it in a particular fashion. These alternative designations have 
been made both instead of and in addition to designating land as wilderness.126 
In Montana, several wilderness bills have tried to secure wilderness designation 

 
Stat. 1425 (1977) (codified at 16 U.S.C. 482b (2006)). Subsequent legislation has expanded the area and 
types of protection in response to USFS management, and it is currently managed in cooperation and 
partnership with the Portland Water Bureau. See Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3001 (1996) (codified at 
16 U.S.C. 482b (2006)) (prohibiting the cutting of trees in parts of the unit with special exceptions);

subsequent  years.  The  disparity  between  what  was  authorized  and  what  is  appropriated  by  Congress 
resulted in proposals to provide a more guaranteed stream of funding. See Allison A. Freeman, Congress

for  some  lands,  while  simultaneously  holding  other  lands  for  future 
designation  possibilities,  and  yet  others  for  special  management.127  The  Lee 
Metcalf  Wilderness  and  Management  Act  provides  an  example  with  its 
establishment of four wilderness units in addition to the Cabin Creek Special 
Management  Area.128  Such  designations  have  been  used  to  find  political 
compromise  for  contested  lands  and  to  limit  agency  discretion  in  how  non-
wilderness lands are managed.129 

More  recent  wilderness  legislation  continues  the  tradition  of  political 
compromise. These laws, and some proposed bills, go beyond the release of 
selected  roadless  lands  in  exchange  for  wilderness  designation.130  Instead  of 
simply releasing these lands to discretionary  multiple use management, some 
laws  (or  conservation  packages)  provide  more  prescription  in  how  non-
wilderness lands must be managed by the agency in the future. In some cases, 
the  deal-making  has  become  more  complicated,  with  more  actors  seeking 
legislated assurances  for  how  a  public land unit  will be  managed,  inside  and 
outside of the federally designated wilderness. 

Though  not  focused  on  the  national  forests,  the  Steens  Mountain 
Cooperative  Management  and  Protection  Area  Act  of  2000  provides  an 
example.131 Among other provisions, this complex legislation designates about 
175,000 acres of wilderness and a much larger Cooperative Management and 
Protection  Area.132  The  Act  mandates  how  both  areas  are  to  be  managed, 
while  also  creating  an  advisory  council  to  oversee  management  and  make 
recommendations to the BLM.133 Depending on ones perspective, the Steens 
Act  provides  either  a  positive  model  of  how  legislative  packages  might  be 
crafted in the future or a new breed of compromise posing a serious threat to 

 
  127.  Montana  wilderness  bills  introduced  in  1984,  1986,  and  1987  included  wilderness,  national 
recreation,  and  special  management  area  designations  for  selected  lands.  See  S.  2850,  98th  Cong. 
(1984), S. 2790, 99th Cong. (1986), and H.R. 2090, 100th Cong. (1987); S. 1478, 100th Cong. (1987). 
  128.  Pub. L. No. 98-140, 97 Stat. 901 (1983). Subsequent management of the Cabin Creek Area 
has been controversial, with debate centered on how to meet the Acts purpose of preserving the Area 
and its wildlife while providing compatible historic recreational (motorized) use. See Faye B. McKnight, 
The Use of Special Management Areas as Alternatives to Wilderness Designations or Multiple Use 
Management of Federal Public Lands, 8 PUB. LAND L. REV. 61 (1987) (using the Cabin Creek case to 
examine the strengths and weaknesses of alternative protected land designations). 
  129.  See NATURAL RESOURCES LAW CTR., supra note 125, at 1617. 
  130.  Wilderness  politics  often  centers  on  the  release  of  non-designated  lands  to  multiple  use 
management,  and  whether  or  not  such  lands  might  be  considered  for  wilderness  designation  in 
subsequent forest plans. Conservationists favor a soft release whereby non-designated lands would get 
another  look  in  future  planning  processes.  Others  prefer  hard  release  language  that  permanently 
disqualifies an area from future wilderness consideration. See generally ROSS W. GORTE, WILDERNESS

controversial omnibus wilderness laws135 and proposed bills136 that conveyed 
or proposed to convey selected federal lands to private and state ownership in 
exchange  for  wilderness  designation  in  other  areas.  These  wilderness  bills, 
rightly or wrongly, have influenced debate over the BDP proposal (which does

Valles Caldera National Preserve and Trust.137 Here, the USFS plays a smaller 
managerial  role  than  in  the  examples  referenced  above.  But  the  legislation 
illustrates how lawmakers are willing to reconsider how newly acquired lands 
might  be  managed.  In  2000,  Congress  acquired  the  privately  owned  Baca 
Ranch is northern New Mexico.138 Instead of simply buying the property and 
transferring  its  management  to  the  USFS  or  the  National  Park  Service, 
Congress found an experimental management regime should be provided by 
the  establishment  of  a  Trust  capable  of  using  new  methods  of  public  land 
management that may prove cost-effective and environmentally sensitive.139 
A nine-member board of trustees, which includes a USFS official, manages the 
Preserve.140  Congress  directed  the  Trust  to  operate  the  holding  as  a  working 
ranch, providing multiple use and sustained yield management.141 This case is 
also  significant  because  the  law  aims  to  pull  the  Valles  Caldera  out  of  the 
traditional  federal  lands  funding  stream  by  allowing  and  providing  for  the 
ranch to eventually become financially self-sustaining.142 As discussed below, 
the  BDP,  among  other  place-based  efforts,  are  similarly  proposing  ways  in 
which federal lands management can be funded without relying so much on the 
highly uncertain, and often inadequate, congressional appropriations process. 

All of the cases referenced above demonstrate that there is some history of 
using  place-based  legislation  in  the  national  forest  system,  a  trend  most

pronounced in the designation of various wilderness and special management 
areas.  The  legislation  comes  in  numerous  guises,  but  each  has  the  effect  of 
mandating how one particular unit is to be managed, thus limiting the USFSs 
managerial discretion. All of the place-based proposals described below share 
some things in common with the place-based laws reviewed above, so the new 
proposals are not altogether unique. What is different about the new proposals 
is the direction provided in how to manage lands not designated as wilderness 
or  a  special  management  area.  The  scope  and  specificity  of  management 
direction, unrelated to wilderness, and in some cases across an entire national 
forest, is what is precedential and different about the new place-based proposals 
and why they are worth scrutinizing at this point. 

Interest  in  the  legislated  approach  to  forest  management  is  growing. 
Though  different  than  the  BDP  in  fundamental  ways,  several  place-based 
initiatives  are  underway  in  Montana  and  Idaho.  Take,  for  example,  the 
Blackfoot-Clearwater  Landscape  Stewardship  Project.143  This  legislative 
proposal  is  designed  as  a  demonstration  project  that  would  secure  a  more 
permanent  balance  between  wilderness,  restoration,  resource  use,  and 
recreation.144  The  proposal  currently 
includes  wilderness  designation, 
motorized recreation provisions, and a restoration pilot project.145 It also seeks 
authorizing  appropriations  of  $750,000  per  year  for  ten  years  in  order  to 
accomplish  the  groups  planning,  management,  restoration,  and  monitoring 
objectives.146 Also requested is congressional funding for a biomass facility for 
Pyramid  Lumber,  one  of  the  key  stakeholders  of  the  group.147  Though 
legislation is sought, the pilot projects core provisions are consistent with the 
applicable Lolo National Forest Plan.148 

To  the  northwest  of  the  Blackfoot-Clearwater  is  the  Three  Rivers 
Challenge.149  It  hopes  to  end  the  bitter  timber  wars  that  have  characterized 
management  of  the  Kootenai  National  Forest.  To  that  end,  a  broad  group  of 
stakeholders  are  advocating  passage  of 
the  Three  Rivers  Challenge

wood  products  for  local  communities.151  Among  these  provisions  include 
mandated  restoration  projects,  broad  stewardship  contracting  authority, 
wilderness designation, a special conflict resolution process, and the permanent 
establishment of some motorized and non-motorized areas on the forest, among 
other special designations.152 

Finally, a more nascent, but potentially larger place-based effort exists in 
Idahos  Clearwater  Basin.  With  leadership  provided  by  Idaho  Senator  Mike 
Crapo,153 several interests are negotiating management of the Clearwater and 
Nez Perce National Forests. At this point, the Clearwater Basin Collaborative 
is assessing the potential of resolving several issues via legislation, including 
drafting a comprehensive land use allocation bill and funding strategy.154 Like 
other place-based efforts, wilderness designation is being discussed along with 
restoration  and  economic  development  provisions.  These  examples,  among 
others in Washington State155 and southeast Alaska,156 demonstrate a growing 
interest in finding legislated solutions to national forest management.

ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY 

[Vol. 37:1 

A.  Background 

The BDNF covers 3.38 million acres in southwestern Montana.157 Larger 
than  Glacier  and  Yellowstone  National  Parks  combined,  it  includes  sixteen 
mountain ranges, 400 miles of the Continental Divide, and some of the best elk 
habitat  in  the  state.158  Resource  allocation  conflictswith  some  interests 
wanting  more  commodity  use  and  motorized  access  and  others  more 
preservation of the forestare common on the BDNF, as they are elsewhere. 
Consider, for example, that 152 administrative appeals have been filed on the 
BDNF  during  the  last  decade,  and  that  twenty-five  lawsuits  have  been  filed 
over  the  past  two  decades.159  Most  of  these  challenges  have  centered  on 
timber-related projects, with a handful of conservation groups most responsible 
for making them.160 

Wilderness designation, and the lack thereof, is a major source of conflict 
on the BDNF. To date, the BDNF manages two federal wilderness areas, the 
Anaconda-Pintler and a portion of the Lee Metcalf, totaling 225,147 acres.161 
Not presently included in the federal wilderness system are 1.9 million acres of 
inventoried  roadless  areas  on  the  BDNF.162  The  BDNF  also  manages  two 
wilderness  study  areas  totaling  210,174  acres.163  USFS  management  of 
wilderness study areas in Montana has been controversial because the Montana 
Wilderness Study Act though designed to protect these places, did not prohibit 
the  use  of  off-road  vehicles  in  these  areas.164  And  off-road  vehicle  use 
obviously has the potential of diminishing those wilderness characteristics that 
Congress intended to protect.165 

The state of Montanas timber industry is also pertinent to this case study 
because  the  BDP  seeks  to  provide  it  with  greater  certainty  and  stability.  A 
multitude of economic factors help explain why so many mills have closed in

the  state  and  why  those  remaining  see  the  future  with  some  trepidation.166 
International  market  trends,  increased  Canadian  imports,  lower  prices,  and 
fewer housing starts are largely responsible for the industrys woes.167 Several 
timber  mills  in  Montana,  for  example,  received  help  from  the  Trade 
Adjustment  Assistance  Program,  thus  indicating  that  imports  have  seriously 
challenged  several  Montana  mills.168  But  the  Partnerships  timber  industry 
interests  also  count  access  to  federal  timberlands  as  part  of  the  equation.169 
They partly blame appeals, litigation, and excessive analysis by the USFS for 
the diminished and always uncertain timber supply.170 For the timber industry, 
a more certain supply from the BDNF will at least resolve one of the industrys 
problems.171 

Forest  plans  were  completed  for  the  BDNF  in  1986  and  1987.172  As 
required by NFMA, the revision of these plans began in 2002 using the 1982 
planning  regulations.173  Before  the  BDP  formed,  its  eventual  members 
expressed  frustration  at  what  they  considered  to  be  a  broken  forest  planning 
process.  Conservationists  and  the  timber  industry  asked  for  more  assurances 
than  provided  by  the  agency  in  its  revision  of  the  forest  plan,  while  timber

one side are those quick to blame the USFS, mostly because of diminished supply. See, e.g., CHARLES E.

MONTANAS  TIMBER  AND  FOREST  PRODUCTS  INDUSTRY  SITUATION  2004  (2005)  (report  prepared  for 
Montanas congressional delegation). On the other side are those who see international market trends as 
being most significant. See, e.g., Bosworth & Brown, supra note 41, at 272 (reviewing studies showing 
how highly productive plantation forests in the U.S. and abroad have erased the postwar need for large-
scale timber supplies from national forest land).

interests wanted more stable supplies. The BDNF, according to Sun Mountain 
Lumber  Co.,  should  be  providing  sustainable  and  predictable  levels  of 
production  and  services.174  And  according  to  the  Montana  Wilderness 
Association, 

The forest plan is a contract between the people who own and those who 
manage  our  national  forests.  This  contract  should  provide  clarity  and 
certainty  for  all  who  have  a  stake  in  public  lands  .  .  .  .  [In  Montana] 
different  people  seek  different  commitments  in  the  forest  plan  contract, 
whether 
its  small  mills,  snowmobilers,  hunters,  communities  or 
conservationists. We want tangible commitments. We want to know where 
we stand today and what will remain tomorrow.175 
It is during the plan revision period that the BDP formed and submitted a 
proposal  to  be  considered  by  the  USFS,  even  though  the  public  comment 
period had ended. The Partnership consists of three conservation organizations 
(Montana Trout Unlimited, Montana Wilderness Association, National Wildlife 
Federation) and five timber companies (Pyramid Mountain Lumber, Roseburg 
Forest  Products,  RY  Lumber,  Smurfit-Stone  Container,  Sun  Mountain 
Lumber).176  The  Partnerships  objective  was  to  create  a  forest  plan  that 
provides  greater  predictability,  defuses  conflict,  and  implements  meaningful 
on-the-ground projects.177 

With  encouragement  by  the  USFSs  Region  1  Office,  the  Partnership 
submitted their forest planning proposal for consideration by the agency. The 
USFS did not, however, study the proposal as a separate planning alternative. 
Instead, the USFS added an alternative 6 to the BDNFs Revised Draft Plan 
to partly respond to the Partnerships proposal.178 Even though this alternative 
was  chosen  by  the  USFS,  the  Partnership  decided  that  its  interests  were  not 
adequately  addressed  in  the  adopted  forest  plan.  So  in  February  2007,  the 
Partnership  released  draft  legislation  to  implement  their  strategy.179  The 
Beaverhead-Deerlodge  Conservation,  Restoration  and  Stewardship  Act  of 
2007 (the BDP proposal) has gone through various iterations and continues 
to  be  a  work  in  progress.180  But  its  core  philosophy  and  approach  remain 
unchanged, and the Partnership is currently lobbying Montanas congressional 
delegation for the bills passage.181

B. Key BDP Proposal Provisions 

There  are  four  central  provisions  of  the  proposal  that  we  wish  to 
emphasize: wilderness, timber supply, restoration, and stewardship contracting. 
We now consider each in turn.  

1.  Wilderness Designation 

The BDP seeks to designate roughly 570,000 acres as federal wilderness 
in  sixteen  areas  across  the  BDNF.182  Most  of  these  areas  were  included  in 
previous  (unsuccessful)  wilderness  bills  and  have  been  the  source  of  much 
controversy.183  The  Partnerships  wilderness 
are 
considerably  higher  than  those  made  by  the  BDNF,  which  recommended 
329,000  acres  in  its  forest  plan  revision.184  The  wilderness  component  is 
central to the Partnerships strategy and bill for two reasons. First, it is what 
brought and kept conservation interests at the negotiating table. Second, federal 
wilderness designation requires an Act of Congress,185 meaning that legislating 
part of the Partnerships proposal was unavoidable.

the  wilderness  provision  does  not 

its 
controversy.  The  designations  are  opposed  by  an  assortment  of  motorized 
vehicle  groups,  a  mountain  biker  organization,  some  adjacent  counties,  and 
commodity  interests  because  of  lost  access.186  Criticism  has  also  come  from 
some environmental interests who believe that too many inventoried roadless 
areas  and  wilderness  study  areas  are  being  sacrificed  and  instead  deserve 
wilderness protection. These interests question why participating environmental 
groups would be willing to release more than 200,000 acres of roadless lands, 
some  for  possible  timber  management.  Also  questioned  is  the  decision  to 
sacrifice portions of two wilderness study areas that already have some legal 
protection.187  The  quality  of  the  lands  being  released  is  also  a  concern  to 
critics. They emphasize that most of the wilderness designations made in the 
BDP  proposal  are  in  alpine  and  sub-alpine  areas  that  receive  relatively  few

threats  compared  to  the  more  ecologically  significant  lower  lands  being 
released to timber management.188 

2.  Timber Supply 

The  second  central  provision  of  the  Partnerships  proposal  aims  to 
produce  a  diverse  forest  with  far  fewer  roads  while  also  generating  a  more 
predictable flow of wood products for local communities.189 To this end, the 
Partnership  initially  supported  designating  approximately  713,000  acres  as 
suitable  for  timber  production  under  stewardship  contracts.190  These 
important  designations  are  made  in  forest  plans,  in  accordance  with  NFMA, 
and act as a gateway through which subsequent projects must pass.191 A timber 
project,  for  example,  could  not  generally  take  place  in  an  area  unless  it  was 
zoned  as  suitable  for  timber  harvesting.  But  instead  of  leaving  such 
determinations  to  the  BDNF,  the  Partnerships  draft  bill  takes  a  different 
approach.192  It  designates  stewardship  areas  that  include  eligible  lands 
implemented.193 
where  landscape  scale  restoration  projects  shall  be 
Approximately  2.27  million  acres  of  the  3.35  million  acre  forest  would  be 
designated as stewardship areas.194 The approach, in other words, is to first 
designate stewardship areas on the BDNF, and to then carve out a percentage of 
these  lands  to  make  them  eligible  for  landscape  scale  restoration  projects. 
These  projects  shall  include  vegetation  management  through  commercial 
timber harvest, prescribed burning, and other silvicultural techniques.195 

The BDP proposed bill includes language stipulating that the Secretary 
shall  mechanically  treat  timber  that  yields  value  for  meeting  the  restoration 
goals of this Act, on a minimum of 70,000 acres of eligible land within ten 
years of the Acts passage.196 This provision is among the most controversial 
because critics see it as a legislated and unsustainable mandate to cut timber for 
the benefit of local mills. After all, the BDNFs plan revision only designated 
299,000  acres  as  suitable  for  timber  production.197  Supporters,  however, 
believe that the stewardship areas/eligible lands provision offers a reasonable 
way to provide some long-term stability and predictability to an industry that is

needed if forest restoration is to be accomplished in the future. They emphasize 
that the bill does not mandate so many board feet to be cut per year, but simply 
designates those lands that are eligible for harvesting in the futureall while 
complying with existing laws and newly legislated standards. 

3.  Forest Restoration 

Forest  restoration  is  the  third  key  part  of  the  Partnership  strategy.  The 
partners  are  unified  in  their  belief  that  the  BDNF  requires  forest  restoration 
through active forest management. For them, simply designating wilderness
much of which is high alpine rocks and ice countryis not sufficient. They 
have instead adopted a more landscape-level approach prioritizing a number of 
specific  restoration  objectives.  These  objectives  include  the  removal  of  some 
permanent roads, restoring more natural patterns on the forest, modifying fuels 
along the forest periphery, reducing threats from fire and insects by modifying 
tree age class diversity, and improving aquatic habitats, among others.198 

Key  to  the  Partnerships  restoration  strategy  is  to  retain  timber 
management  as  a  viable  management  tool.199  The  Partnership  contends  that 
many problems on the BDNF will not self-correct, but will require large-scale 
and  multi-faceted  restoration  projects.  To  accomplish  this,  landscape  scale 
restoration projects, which could be up to 50,000 acres in size, are mandated 
in  the  draft  legislation.200  The  bill  requires  implementation  of  at  least  one 
landscape-scale restoration project annually on eligible lands, while providing a 
very  specific  set  of  priorities  and  restoration  requirements  (including  road 
density  standards,  vegetative  management  prescriptions,  and  limits  on  new 
access roads).201 

4. 

Stewardship Contracting 

Stewardship contracting is the fourth provision we wish to emphasize, as it 
would primarily be used to achieve the Partnerships restoration objectives.202 
In  1998,  Congress  authorized  the  USFS  to  use  stewardship  contracting  to 
achieve various land management goals such as restoring forest and rangeland 
health  and  water  quality,  improving  fish  and  wildlife  habitat,  and  reducing 
hazardous fuels.203 To achieve these goals, stewardship contracting allows the 
exchange of goods for services.204 In other words, the commodities produced

through  a  contract,  like  timber,  are  exchanged  for  requested  restoration 
services,  like  decommissioning  roads  or  replacing  culverts.  Stewardship 
contracting allows a national forest to retain the receipts generated by selling 
timber for use in future stewardship projects.205 This provision is attractive to 
the  Partnership  because  stewardship  receipts  do  not  have  to  return  to  the 
Department of Treasurys general fund as required of timber sales.206 

The stewardship contracting approach to forest restoration is increasingly 
used  by  the  USFS  and  BLM,207  and  the  tool  squares  perfectly  with  the 
Partnerships  philosophy  and  objectives.  The  Partnership  has  little  faith  that 
restoration needs on the BDNF will be adequately funded through the normal 
appropriations process, so it sees stewardship contracting as the best vehicle to 
accomplish  its  fuel  reduction  and  restoration  objectives.  Proponents  of 
stewardship  contracting  emphasize  the  tools  ability  to  foster  collaboration, 
provide a more steady supply of timber, and to get work accomplished more 
effectively  and  efficiently  on-the-ground.208  Stewardship  contracting,  says 
the  Partnership,  [w]ill  help  ensure 
local  communities  benefit 
economically from restored landscapes and a dependable timber supply.209 As 
discussed below, the Partnerships emphasis on stewardship contracting is also

nature, while opponents, including two adjacent counties, focus on the narrow

III.  QUESTIONS AND ANALYSIS 

The BDP proposal is one of several cases in which divergent interests are 
negotiating  management  of  national  forests  and  seeking  codification  of  the 
resulting agreements. Given the current state of national forest management (as 
outlined in Part I), we believe that more place-based bills will be offered in the 
future. This Part asks several questions that should be answered by both those 
in favor of and opposed to the BDP and similar place-based initiatives. 

Answers  to  these  subjective  questions  will  undoubtedly  be  nuanced, 
contingent,  and  value-laden.  We  hope  that  such  questions  will  help  frame 
future debate over place-based legislation and perhaps help us avoid potential 
pitfalls and unintended consequences. In the balance of Part III, we will address 
these  questions  and  draw  our  own  conclusions,  some  of  them  critical  of  the 
BDP proposed bill, others critical of a dysfunctional status quo. But the primary 
point of this Part is to initiate dialogue and pose some questions that we believe 
have not been sufficiently considered. 

A.  Governance and Conflict Resolution 

Would  a  proliferation  of  place-based  forest  laws  disunify  the  relatively 

consistent mission and mandate of the USFS? 

Can place-based legislation be an effective way of resolving long standing 
political  conflicts  over  forest  management?  Could  legislation  help  reduce 
appeals and litigation? 

Are place-based laws likely to conflict with preexisting agency mandates, 

environmental laws, and planning requirements? 

Can  legislation  achieve  greater  certainty  and  stability  for  the  timber 

industry while balancing for other uses and environmental values? 

Our first set of questions focuses on governance and the ability of place-
based laws to resolve conflict and deliver on promises made in legislation. If 
replicated more broadly, the place-based approach to forest management could 
further  disaggregate  the  national  forest  system.  Law-by-law,  the  national 
forests would start to resemble the national park and wildlife refuge systems. A 
relatively  consistent  mission  and  mandate  applicable  to  all  national  forests 
would  be  replaced  by  more  site-specific  prescriptive  laws  detailing  how 
particular units must be managed. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, 
but  such  a  transformation  should  be  recognized  for  what  it  is,  and  only  be 
implemented after full consideration. Part of that discussion should also include 
the  question  of  whether  place-based  approaches  make  larger  ecosystem  and 
landscape-level  planning  more  difficult.  As  evident  in  the  Quincy/Sierra 
Framework  case  and  others,  there  is  a  tension  between  finding  localized

[Vol. 37:1 

solutions  to  national  forest management  and  the  need  to  sometimes  plan  and 
manage at larger landscape, and even regional, scales.213 

In theory, the place-based legislative approach might help resolve several 
enduring political conflicts, like roadless area management. Such issues could 
be dealt with squarely in legislation, rather than pushing them into alternative 
forums  of  conflict  resolution,  like  interminable  planning  or  rulemaking 
processes. In some respects, it is useful to analyze the BDP and other place-
based proposals as a continuation of the multiple versus dominant use debate. 
Since  the  1960s,  calls  have  been  made  to  replace  the  multiple  use  paradigm 
with some sort of dominant use arrangement, such as legislatively zoning some 
lands for protection and others for commodity production.214 But unlike some 
of the top-down reform proposals of the past, the place-based approach seeks to 
do  the  same  thing  from  the  bottom-up.  Both  approaches  seek  to  do  via 
legislation  what  has  historically  been  done  via  forest  planning  at  the 
administrative level. 

Our  review  of  other  place-based  national  forest  laws  should  temper 
excitement  about  their  potential  for  conflict  resolution.  At  this  point,  for 
example,  the  Valles  Caldera  Act215  has  not  resolved  very  basic  multiple  use 
conflicts that are in some ways embedded into the legislation itself. Instead, the 
resolution  of  such  conflicts  is  simply  the  responsibility  of  the  Trust,  not  a 
federal land agency. Core differences of opinion remain about what uses should 
be prioritized by the Trust, how to apply NEPA, and the well-worn question of 
how to balance resource use with environmental protection.216 

Unit-specific laws like the Tongass Timber Reform Act and the Herger-
Feinstein  Act  have  engendered  more  conflict  than  consensus.  Part  of  this 
conflict  is  due  to  the  contested  statutory  language  in  each  Act  (for  example, 
what constitutes market demand on the Tongass), and part is due to how such 
laws fit into the preexisting legal and planning framework. Recall, for example, 
the  ongoing  problem  of  how  to  reconcile  differences  between  the  Herger-
Feinstein Act and the Sierra Framework plan, all while complying with NEPA,

NFMA, and the ESA.217 The USFS has been forced to walk this minefield with 
legal grenades thrown from all directions. When the USFS tries to implement 
the Sierra Framework and its interpretation of NEPA, NFMA, and the ESA, it 
gets sued by the Quincy Library Group for subordinating the Herger-Feinstein 
Act; and when the agency tries to implement the Herger-Feinstein Act, its gets 
challenged  by  environmental  groups  for  not  complying  with  NEPA,  NFMA, 
and the ESA.218 Where the chips ultimately fall is still uncertain, but it is safe 
to say at this point that the Herger-Feinstein Act did not resolve core conflicts 
about managing the Sierra Nevada. 

Even if place-based laws aid in conflict resolution, they might still present 
the same sorts of challenges that face the national parks and wildlife refuges, 
such as how to simultaneously meet and pay for mandates expressed in organic 
and enabling legislation.219 And while a forest-specific law might resolve some 
conflicts,  it  could  also  reduce  the  agencys  ability  to  adapt  to  future 
circumstances.  Ever-present  in  forest  management  is  the  tension  between 
prescriptive law and agency discretion. The BDP proposal, among other place-
based proposals, could swing the pendulum too far by making adaptation more 
of an afterthought than a central governing principle. The BDP case therefore 
presents a paradox of sorts. On the one hand, the Partnership seeks to provide 
greater certainty and stability in forest management. On the other hand is the 
popular  embrace  of  adaptive  management  and  the  principles  on  which  it  is 
based.220  The  question  that  emerges,  then,  is  how  the  BDP  proposal,  and

management plans are strategic in nature and one stage in an adaptive cycle of planning). Monitoring 
is a key part of any adaptive approach to forest management. Until monitoring becomes required and

similar  initiatives,  will  ensure  sufficient  room  to  adapt  to  new  problems  and 
changed circumstances. 

Each place-based law will inevitably be tested by litigants and parsed by 
the  courts.  The  potential  for  legal  challenge  becomes  even  more  pronounced 
when  preexisting  environmental 
in  place-based 
legislation.  Consider,  for  example,  the  BDP  proposal  in  its  current  form.  It 
includes  enforceable  mandates 
to  preexisting 
environmental  laws  and  processes.  But  what  happens  if  the  BDNF  decides, 
after conducting its NEPA analysis, that the timber supply mandate cannot be 
reconciled with its other legal responsibilities? 

that  are  simply  added 

laws  are  safeguarded 

There  are  other  expectations,  aside  from  the  BDPs  timber  supply 
provision, that are of concern to us. First is the expectation that the legislation 
will help the BDNF cut through its process predicament. Without additional 
funding  that  could  expedite  the  environmental  review  process,  we  fail  to  see 
how  additional  legislation  will  help  matters.  When  it  comes  to  meeting  its 
NEPA obligations, the USFS needs more funding, leadership, and institutional 
support, not more law. We also fear the inevitable backlash that will result if 
the BDPs timber targets are not met on time because of the agencys NEPA 
requirements. 

Even less realistic is the BDPs belief that greater certainty and stability 
for  the  timber  industry  can  be  achieved  through  legislation.  This  pursuit  is  a 
dominant  theme  in  natural  resources  policy  and  its  application  to  forest 
management has been debated ad nauseum.221 It is a shibboleth to some, and 
unlikely  to  be  achieved  according  to  a  former  USFS  Chief,  222  among  other 
 
  221.  See, e.g., Con H. Schallau & Richard M. Alston, The Commitment to Community Stability: A 
Policy  or  Shibboleth,  17  ENVTL.  L.  429  (1987).  They  note  that  [p]ublic  land  legislation  contains  a 
general  theme  of  concern  for  the  economic  stability  of  communities.  However,  there  is  little  explicit 
statutory  direction  on  how  large  a  role  community  stability  concerns  should  play  in  Forest  Service 
decisions. Id. at 460 (internal citation omitted). They go on to say that [c]onfusion about community 
stability stems from the fact that although Congress frequently reaffirms its desire to achieve community 
stability, it has not provided any operational guidelines for doing so. Id. at 479. See also REPORT OF

skeptics who question the assumptions on which the concept is based.223 There 
are simply too many external and uncontrollable impediments to achieving this 
objective:  including  fluctuating  housing  starts,  cheap  Canadian  imports, 
vacillating  court  decisions,  swings  in  agency  budgets,  and  so  on.  And  then

Congress  clearly  prioritizes  one  value  over  the  other,  and  we  doubt  it  will, 
some tensions or conflicts will persist. 

This  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  local  mills  and  rural  communities 
deserve  little  consideration.  They  deserve  more,  and  carefully-screened, 
restoration-based programs. Tools like stewardship contracting should be used 

 
  223.  See,  e.g.,  SAMUEL  T.  DANA  &  SALLY  FAIRFAX,  FOREST  AND  RANGE  POLICY:  ITS 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES 332 (2d ed. 1980). 
  224.  Consider, for example, conflict over BLM management of O&C grant lands, governed under 
the Oregon and California Lands Act of 1937, 43 U.S.C.  1181a1181j (2006). Unlike other federal 
land  laws  and  regulations,  the  O&C  Act  includes  specific  but  contested  language  pertaining  to 
community stability. Classified lands shall be 

managed . . . for permanent forest production, and the timber thereon shall be sold, cut, and 
removed in conformity with the principal [sic] of sustained yield for the purpose of providing 
a  permanent  source  of  timber  supply,  protecting  watersheds,  regulating  stream  flow,  and 
contributing  to  the  economic  stability  of  local  communities  and  industries,  and  providing 
recreational facilties [sic]. 

43 U.S.C.  1181a. 
 
  Once sustained yield is determined, the Act also requires timber from O&C lands to be sold 
annually at not less than one-half billion feet board measure, or not less than the annual sustained yield 
capacity  when  the  same  has  been  determined  and  declared  .  .  .  or  so  much  thereof  as  can  be  sold  at 
reasonable prices on a normal market. Id. Associated regulations state that sustained-yield units contain 
enough land to provide, insofar as practicable, a permanent source of raw  materials to support local 
communities  and  industries,  giving  due  consideration  to  established  forest  products  operations.  43 
C.F.R.  5040.1 (2009). 
 
  Whether or not the O&C Act is a multiple or dominant use statute has received a lot of debate. 
The  Courts  have  also  wrestled  with  the  Acts  provisions  and  how  they  were  meant  to  be  prioritized. 
Though  timber  shall  be  supplied,  O&C  lands  are  also  subject  to  NEPA,  the  ESA,  and  other 
environmental statutes, thus setting up multiple conflicts over their management. See, e.g., Headwaters, 
Inc. v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 914 F.2d 1174 (9th Cir. 1990) (interpreting the O&C Act as a dominant 
use statute that limits the ability of the BLM to manage for non-timber purposes). But see Deborah Scott 
& Susan Jane M. Brown, The Oregon and California Lands Act: Revisiting the Concept of Dominant 
Use, 21 J. ENVTL. L. & LITIG. 259, 31114 (2006) (challenging the dominant use interpretation of the 
O&C Act and putting forth a broader conception of community stability). 
  225.  The  Alaska  National  Interest  Lands  Conservation  Act  (ANILCA)  required  Congress  to 
provide at least $40 million annually so that the Tongass could meet its mandate of supplying at least 
450 million board feet of timber for sale each year. See Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation 
Act, Pub. L. No. 96-487,  705(a), 94 Stat. 2371, 2420 (1980) (codified at 16 U.S.C. 539(d) (2006)). 
This timber supply mandate ran roughshod over other values and legal obligations. See Nie, supra note 
89, at 40003. As discussed above, ANILCAs controversial timber supply mandate was replaced with 
language requiring the Tongass to seek to meet market demand for Tongass timber. See supra notes 91
99 and accompanying text.

in this regard.226 Even more important would be a serious federal investment in 
forest  restoration  that  could  be  strategically  targeted  to  benefit  rural 
communities and local contractors.227 The BDP is to be admired for its focus 
on both sustainable forests and communities, and for understanding the benefits 
of having a functional timber industry in the state. But we are skeptical that the 
BDP proposal, and place-based legislation in general, is the best way to secure 
these values. It is, in short, the wrong tool for the right job. 

B.  Wilderness Politics 

Do  place-based  proposals  unnecessarily  complicate  the  politics  of 
wilderness  designation?  Do  they  make  more  straightforward  wilderness  bills 
more difficult to pass? 

Is the 2001 roadless rule best viewed as a temporary measure that precedes 
future wilderness negotiations or a policy endpoint? How urgent is the need to 
designate  some  inventoried  roadless  lands  as  federal  wilderness?  Does  such 
urgency necessitate greater compromise? 

There  exists  in  wilderness  politics  a  tension  between  idealism  and 
pragmatism.228 This tension is evident in the Wilderness Act and subsequent 
wilderness  laws,229  for  each  are  generally  the  product  of  negotiation  and 
compromise.  Though  simplified,  this  tension  is  particularly  helpful  to 
understanding  debate  over  the  BDP  proposal.  On  one side are  those  idealists 
who  view  the  proposal  as  part  of  a  dangerous  trend  whereby  wilderness 
designation is exchanged for some type of economic development. This model, 
they  say,  is  different  than  that  practiced  in  the  past  because  of  the  scope  of 
concessions made in the legislation. Critics fear that it creates a precedent and 
expectation  that  future  wilderness  bills  must  be  packaged  with  economic 
development  provisions  if  they  are  to  be  politically  feasible.230  Wilderness

the legislative process, yet at the same time, I would submit that wilderness is not for sale. Simply put, I 
believe we should not seek the lowest common denominator when it comes to wilderness and saddle a 
wilderness  designation  with  exceptions,  exclusions  and  exemptions.  Greg  Stahl,  CIEDRA  Begins

idealists allege that the pragmatists are now too eager to compromise and make 
concessions to protect too small of areas as wilderness. Instead, idealists prefer 
to hold out for something better, such as a cleaner and more inclusive region- 
or state-wide wilderness bill. 

Of course, pragmatists see things differently. Wilderness has always been 
about compromise, they insist, and concessions have to be made to move the 
agenda forward.231 Montanas political context is also important in this regard. 
The states wilderness drought will continue unless Montanas congressional 
delegation  says  otherwise.  While  parts  of  the  delegation  support  negotiated 
home-grown  initiatives,  what  this  means  exactly  is  far  from  clear.232  The 
pragmatists believe that place-based approaches reduce the exposure and risks 
inherent  in  wilderness  politics.  After  all,  the  wilderness  proposals,  and 
negotiated  details,  are  brought  forth  from  the  bottom-up,  thus  making 
wilderness a potentially safer political issue. 

If  replicated  more  broadly,  place-based  forest  laws  with  wilderness 
components could make it more difficult to pass larger and simpler wilderness 
laws in the future.233 Economic development provisions, like a timber supply 
mandate,  could  become  de  facto  requirements.  Recent  wilderness  laws  and 
proposals  include  those  with  economic  development  provisions  and  more 
if 
straightforward 
congressional  leadership  allows  it.  In  any  event,  the  possibility  deserves 
consideration  because  of  the  precedent  that  could  be  established.  And  the 
importance of precedent is made clear by the special provisions that are often 
replicated in wilderness laws. Once used, provisions related to such matters as 

traditional  approaches.234  But

water rights and buffer areas are regularly stamped onto future wilderness bills 
as a matter of course.235 

Debate over the BDP also foreshadows future conflicts about roadless area 
management.  Some  conservation  interests  oppose  the  BDP  approach,  either 
because it fails to protect all roadless areas in the BDNF or does not designate 
enough of them as federal wilderness. Some groups are willing to gamble that 
roadless areas on the BDNF will be permanently protected once the roadless 
rule  litigation  runs  its  course.  Why  sacrifice  an  acre,  in  other  words,  if  this 
administrative  protection  is  forthcoming?  On  the  other  hand  are  those  who 
view the roadless rule as a more temporary stop-gap measure designed to keep 
the roadless pieces in place until their permanent status can be decided through 
legislation. After all, the 2001 and 2005 roadless rules do not usurp Congresss 
prerogative to designate wilderness or to release roadless lands to multiple use 
management.236 

Also  important  to  consider  are  the  differences  between  a  federal 
wilderness and a USFS-managed roadless area. Perhaps most important is that 
the 2001 roadless rule does not prohibit motorized recreation on roadless lands. 
Calling the 59 million acres protected under the 2001 roadless rule de facto 
wilderness  is  simply  wrong.  While  federal  wilderness  law  clearly  prohibits 
motorized recreation, the 2001 roadless rule does not. Motorized recreation is 
the  wildcard  in  this  story.  Its  usage  in  roadless  areas  could  be  prohibited  by 
travel management plans. But more plausible is that the USFS will allow some 
use  in  roadless  areas  and  such  use  will  hamper  future  efforts  at  designating 
areas as wilderness.237 There is some urgency to designating areas as federal 
wilderness  because  of  growing  threats  posed  by  motorized  recreation.  This 
reality forces critics of the BDP and other wilderness proposals to answer how 
they propose to address this situation. What happens, for example, to roadless 
lands that are not soon protected as wilderness? Will increasing motorized use 
in  these  areas,  by  design  or  default,  make  the  question  of  future  wilderness 
designation moot? Choosing to wait for a more inclusive and pure wilderness 
law is perfectly understandable. But holding out comes with the significant risk 
that  some  roadless  lands  will  be  even  more  contested  by  motorized 
recreationists in the future.

system-wide  reform  of  national  forest  management? Would  place-based  laws 
eventually be used as a way to undermine federal environmental laws? 

On the one hand, some applicable lessons might be learned from this case 
and  applied  elsewhere.  All  sorts  of  ways  in  which  to  reform  national  forest 
management  have  been  proposed  in  the  past,238  and  most  of  those  proposals 
focus  on  systemic  measures  imposed  on  all  national  forests  from  the  top-
down.239 Rarer are proposals seeking to learn lessons from the bottom-up, and 
the BDP offers opportunity in this regard. A number of Partnership participants 
and  critics  express  concern  about  the  general  state  of  national  forest 
management and its legal and planning framework. Change must happen, they 
insist, but why not start thinking at the forest-level as opposed to the system-
wide level when it comes to reform? Perhaps the BDP and similar initiatives 
can inform a more system-wide inquiry about national forest law and what can 
be done about it. 

On the other hand, a dangerous precedent could also be set by the BDP 
proposal.  For  it  to  become  law,  at  least  part  of  Montanas  congressional 
delegation would most likely have to support it. With state political support, the 
bills  chances  of  success  are  greatly  improved,  as  Congress  has  a  history  of 
deference to state delegates when it comes to wilderness politics.240 But there is 
also  an  expectation  that  such  deference  will  be  shown  to  other  state 
congressional  delegations.  So,  for  example,  if  Idahos  delegation  defers  to 
Montanas  in  passing  the  BDP  proposal,  we  should  expect  that  Montanas 
delegation will play by the same rules. There are exceptions to this reciprocity 
of course, due to differences in context and a bills substance. Nonetheless, the 
game is generally played this way. Proceeding with the place-based approach to 
national  forest  management  thus  merits  caution.  If  the  recent  spate  of  place-
based bills become law, there will certainly be more offered in the future. And 
if  history  offers  any  indication,  some  of  those  proposals  will  be  even  more 
controversial than the BDP. 

For a recent example, consider the Clearwater Basin Project Bill debated 
in 2004.241 This charter forest and pilot project would have governed parts of 
the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests in Idaho.242 It contained several 
contested  provisions  that  environmental  interests  believed  set  a  dangerous

precedent for how national forests ought to be managed.243 Among these was a 
provision  giving  an  advisory  group  (consisting  of  Idaho  residents  only)  an 
undue amount of power to set forest priorities, schedules, and agendas.244 The 
bill  also  imposed  deadlines  for  required  environmental  analyses.245  If  such 
requirements were not performed in time, their lack of completion could not be 
used as a basis for challenging the associated projects.246 This controversial bill 
did not become law, but the political dynamics could be different in the future 
if place-based enabling legislation becomes more widely used in neighboring 
states. 

Potential  for  abuse  is  even  more  acute  if  individual  forest  bills  contain 
special  privileges  and  exemptions  that  are  not  available  elsewhere.  Consider, 
for  example,  the  Black  Hills  National  Forest.  Former  South  Dakota  Senator 
Tom Daschle used the appropriations process to codify a negotiated settlement 
regarding future management of part of the Black Hills National Forest.247 The 
most controversial part of the deal exempted some fuel reduction projects from 
NEPA analysis, lawsuits, and administrative appeals.248 This special treatment 
quickly  became  political  fodder  as  several  other  members  of  Congress  asked 
why  Senator  Daschle  and  the  Black  Hills  should  get  exemptions  not  offered 
elsewhere.249  This  outcry  was  then  followed  by  several  copycat  legislative 
proposals seeking the same exemptions for other national forests.250 The lesson 
from this case, and others like it, is that subsequent efforts in codifying place-
based agreements could have a dangerous snowball effect. 

As discussed above, the BDP proposal has its own share of controversial 
provisions.  The  process  used  to  craft  the  proposal  has  also  drawn  fire,  from 
perceptions  of  exclusivity  to  its  consideration  by  the  USFS  after  the  public 
comment  period  ended.  On  a  more  general  level  are  concerns  about  giving 
priority  and  a  privileged voice  to  self-selected  interests  in  managing  national 
forests. And then there is the question of what types of pork will inevitably be 
stuffed  into  future  proposals.  Future  place-based  bills  will  be  scrutinized  to 
some degree and may pass or fail on their merits alone. At this point, however, 
it is worth considering how we might ensure that positive precedent is set and 
that future proposals are environmentally sound and in the public interest.

D.  Funding and Implementation 

What financial benefits, risks, and limitations are there in expanded use of 
stewardship contracting? Would a proliferation of place-based laws challenge 
the USFS from a budgetary standpoint? 

As discussed above, the BDP would be primarily implemented and paid 
for by using stewardship contracting authority. For good reason, the Partnership 
wants to free the BDNF from the highly uncertain congressional appropriations 
process,  a  process  that  chronically  underfunds  the  USFS  and  its  needed 
restoration work.251 If lawmakers continue to under invest in federal lands and 
the agencies responsible for managing them, we will undoubtedly see increased 
use of stewardship contracting and other questionable ways in which national 
forests try to become more financially self-sustaining, such as user fees. If used 
appropriately,  stewardship  contracting  could  help  achieve  some  core  BDP 
objectives  and  help  stretch  scarce  dollars.  But  we  question  its  viability  as  a 
primary  implementation  strategy  and  raise  concerns  about  its  potential  abuse 
and related consequences. 

The BDNF is a lodgepole pine-dominant forest and some people question 
whether  such  forests  have  enough  economic  value  to  make  stewardship 
contracting viable on such a massive scale.252 For stewardship contracting to 
work,  economically  valuable  trees  must  be  harvested  to  pay  for  associated 
restoration  projects.  If  timber  value  is  overestimated,  or  markets  for  small 
diameter timber do not materialize or cannot be sustained, restoration projects 
will not be financed. No one can be certain about what the timber market will 
bear in the future, so this assertion that restorations projects can be fully funded 
via stewardship contracting is mostly speculation. The point is that some risks 
and uncertainties of the proposal cannot be legislated away. 

If enacted, the BDP proposal would make stewardship contracting more of 
a program than a tool, as it would be associated with official accomplishment 
targets.  It  was  not  designed  for  such  a  responsibility.253  If  overused, 
 
  251.  Part of this problem is due to the USFS having to transfer money from other agency programs 
to pay for fire management costs. See U.S. GOVT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, PUB. NO. GAO-04-612, 
WILDFIRE  SUPPRESSION:  FUNDING  TRANSFERS  CAUSE  PROJECT  CANCELLATIONS  AND  DELAYS, 
STRAINED  RELATIONSHIPS,  AND  MANAGEMENT  DISRUPTIONS  (2004).  In  2007,  for  example,  wildland 
fire-related  appropriations  represented  over  40  percent  of  the  agencys  total  appropriations.  See  U.S. 
GOVT  ACCOUNTABILITY  OFFICE,  PUB.  NO.  GAO-09-443T,  FOREST  SERVICE,  EMERGING  ISSUES 
HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO ADDRESS PERSISTENT MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES 2 (2009); see also ROSS 
GORTE,  CONG.  RESEARCH  SERV.,  PUB.  NO.  RL  33990,  WILDFIRE  FUNDING  (2008)  (providing  an 
overview  of  these  issues).  Another  problem  is  the  USFSs  line  item  budget  structure  that  lacks  a 
comprehensive restoration line item. 
  252.  Lodgepole  pine  accounts  for  46  percent  of  the  forested  area,  or  1.26  million  acres,  of  the 
BDNF. BDNF REVISED PLAN, supra note 29, at 452. 
  253.  Though used in a different context, the GAO makes a distinction between tools and programs. 
Both agencies [the USFS and BLM] generally consider stewardship contracting to be a tool, rather than 
a program, because it has no associated budget or official accomplishment targets. Instead, the agencies 
must use existing appropriations to plan and administer their stewardship contracting activities. GAO

stewardship contracting has the potential to create problematic incentives. As 
explained  above,  its  authority  allows  a  national  forest  to  retain  receipts  from 
timber  sales  for  use  on  other  stewardship  projects.  The  requirement  to  use 
stewardship monies on future stewardship projects distinguishes it from other 
USFS accounts and slush funds that have caused considerable controversy and 
recent  judicial  rebuke.254  Nonetheless,  there  is  a  potential  for  creating  a 
dangerous  dependency  on  stewardship  sales.  Generating  a  new  stream  of 
revenue  for  the  USFS  was  not  the  primary  objective  of  the  stewardship 
contracting  law.255  And  with  diminished  budgets,  USFS  officials  may 
reasonably wish to sell the largest and most economically valuable trees as part 
of  a  stewardship  contract,  so  that  more  dollars  can  be  used  to  accomplish 
broadly defined restoration goals.256 

The  greater  danger  here  is  that  the  USFS  will  begin  to  view  this 
contracting  approachand  selling  more  or  bigger  trees  to  do  more  fuel 
reduction workas its only option. In a Herger-Feinstein Act-related project in 
California,257the  USFS  only  analyzed  this  financing  option  in  its  NEPA 
analysis of possible fire reduction projects, essentially treating the arrangement 
as  the  only  way  the  agency  could  do  restoration  work.258  But  the  state  of 
California questioned this assumption, and the Ninth Circuit found the agencys 
view  too  limited  and  in  violation  of  NEPA.259  Alternative  ways  to  fund  fire 
reduction  objectives  were  not  analyzed  by  the  agency,  such  as  requesting  a 
special  appropriation  from  Congress,  altering  the  Services  fuel  treatment 
program, or re-prioritizing other funding.260 It is hard not to sympathize with 
the  agency  in  this  regard.  Perhaps  it  is  simply  adjusting  to  its  new  political 
reality, and trying to use whatever tools it can to get work done. But the public

(16 U.S.C.  576-576b (2006)). It helps pay for reforestation costs and some overhead expenses and 
has been criticized for creating incentives to offer uneconomical timber sales. More recent criticism has 
been directed at the agencys Salvage Sale Fund (created by NFMA, 16 U.S.C.  472a(h) (2006)) which 
allows the USFS to retain money from salvage sales, and to spend it with some discretion, rather than 
return it to the Federal Treasury. The Ninth Circuit noted the agencys substantial financial interest in 
harvesting timber as part of this program while questioning the agencys decision making in post-fire 
logging analyses and disputes. Earth Island v. U.S. Forest Serv., 442 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2006); Earth

should  not  acquiesce  so  easily  and  let  Congress  off  the  hook.  As  the  Ninth 
Circuit  asks,  if  fuel  reduction  work  is  of  the  first  importance,  and  [i]f  the 
USFS does not have enough [funding], why should not Congress be asked to 
give it more?261 In our view, stewardship contracting, among other tools used 
to promote financial self-sufficiency, does not absolve Congress of its duty to 
fund the USFS at responsible levels. 

Long-term  multi-year  stewardship  contracts  also  carry  risks.  These 
contracts create some certainty of timber supply, as desired by the BDP, and 
aid  in  the  possible  development  of  markets  for  small-diameter  timber.  The 
long-term  approach  is  logical  on  many  levels  because  it  facilitates  industry 
investment and allows the agency to take a more landscape-level view of forest 
restoration. But circumstances change, and what may be cost effective one year 
may be different the next. 

Take, for example, the case of the White Mountain Project in Arizona. 
The Government Accountability Office reports that this very large stewardship 
project has incurred greater costs than expected and that such costs have taken 
a  substantial  toll  on  the  forests  other  programs,  including  range,  wildlife, 
hazardous fuels, and vegetation and watershed management.262 Further, some 
other fuel reduction projects were not being completed because their funding 
sources  were  being  monopolized  by  the  White  Mountain  Project.263  Other 
national  forests  in  the  region  also  paid  a  price  to  service  the  terms  of  this 
contract, and [a]s the region has redirected funds toward the White Mountain 
Project,  these  other  forests  have  become  resentful  of  the  disproportionate 
amount of funding the project has received.264 

resource-specific 

Beyond  our  concerns  about  overreliance  on  stewardship  contracting,  we 
also  question  how  future  place-based  laws  might  be  funded.  Generally 
speaking,  USFS  budgets  are  programmatically-aligned,  not  place-  or  forest-
centric.265 Money for programs on the national forests is based on a limited set 
of 
from  National 
Headquarters  to  the  individual  national  forests.  Some  criticize  this  approach 
because it does not align well with the integrated or ecosystem-based nature of 
forest management, and because some prioritized activities, such as restoration, 
do not have their own line-items.266 Several recommendations have been made 
in the past about how to fix USFS budgetary problems, including the possibility 

that  get  stovepiped

of  a  place-based  budgeting  structure.267  From  a  budgetary  perspective,  the 
place-based approach could also move the national forests closer to that of the 
national parks, where state congressional delegations treat parks like their own 
fiefdoms,  exercising  inordinate  control  over  a  unit  via  committees  and  purse 
strings.268 

Place-based legislationand its typical mix of wilderness, restoration, and 
economic  developmentbring  to  the  fore  several  budget-related  questions. 
How,  for  example,  will  budgets  be  distributed  by  the  National  Headquarters 
and Regional Offices if an increasing number of national forests have their own 
legal mandates and costly responsibilities? Might funding for the BDP be taken 
from  other  national  forests  in  the  region?  Will  more  senior  congressional 
delegations  be  more  successful  in  securing  funding  for  place-based  laws  in 
their states? Will it create a system of haves and have nots in the national 
forest  system?  Do  we  want  congressional  appropriations  committees 
determining  forest-by-forest  budgets?  And  perhaps  most  important,  would 
these budgetary situations benefit the national forest system as a whole? Such 
questions  should  be  addressed  before  the  place-based  approach  becomes 
replicated more broadly. 

IV.  ALTERNATIVES 

If  not  this,  then  what?  That  compelling  question  was  asked  by  several 
supporters of the BDP proposal interviewed for this Article. The point is well-
taken,  as  it  is  difficult  to  defend  the  status  quo  in  forest  management.  The 
Partnership took the bold and pro-active step of putting its vision of successful 
forest  management  into  action.  Critics  of  the  BDP  are  therefore  obliged  to 
provide their vision of success and a feasible alternative to the status quo. In 
that spirit, this Part offers some ideas and options that might be considered as 
either  a  substitute  or  supplement  to  place-based  legislation.  They  are  mostly 
conceptual, but all put a premium on caution, experimentation, and scale. 

The  BDP  is  essentially  an  experiment  in  forest  management  with  some 
inherent risks. One way of ensuring that future proposals are procedurally and 
substantively  sound  is  to  begin  a  more  deliberate  and  organized  period  of 
experimentation. Instead of considering a flurry of place-based bills on an ad 
hoc basis, Congress could pass an umbrella statute authorizing experiments in 
national forest management, without the need for multiple forest-specific laws. 
This  umbrella  legislation  would  provide  the  legal  parameters  necessary  to

ensure that proposals are in the national interest and are not a backdoor way of 
undermining  environmental  regulations.  Congress  could  also  provide  some 
general objectives and necessary components if proposals are to move forward, 
such as requiring that all proposals have a mandatory monitoring program in 
place. 

Two  general  frameworks  should  be  considered  in  this  context.  We  are 
interested in them mostly because of their design, and not necessarily because 
of their substance. The first is provided by the Collaborative Forest Landscape 
Restoration  Program,  established  in  2009.269  This  program  selects  and  funds 
carefully screened landscape-level forest restoration projects.270 Such projects 
must  comply  with  existing  environmental  laws  and  be  developed  and 
implemented  through  a  collaborative  process.271  Up  to  ten  proposals  can  be 
funded  per  year  (with  only  two  proposals  in  any  one  region  of  the  national 
forest System), and each project is evaluated based on several criteria.272 The 
program  authorizes  $40  million  per  year  for  fiscal  years  2009  to  2019  to  be 
used  to  pay  for  up  to  50  percent  of  selected  restoration  projects.273  Once 
chosen, these projects must incorporate the best available science, use multiple 
party monitoring, and submit reports to selected congressional committees.274 
The  program  has  received  broad-based  support,  from  both  environmental 
groups and the forest products industry.275 Many of the programs goals and 
objectives are similar to those advocated by the BDP, including long-term and 
landscape-level  restoration,  rural  economic  development  and  stability, 
collaboration,  and  more  secure  funding.276  But  unlike  the  place-based  bills 
reviewed  above, 
to 
predetermined rules and national-level oversight.

The Region 7 proposal provides another relevant example of how future 
experimentation could be organized.277 If enacted by Congress, a virtual region 
of  the  USFS  would  be  created  in  order  to  house  innovative  approaches  and

different  models  of  forest  management.278  After  receiving  congressional 
authorization to experiment, different trials would be selected in order to test 
new ideas and foster learning.279 Experiments, trials, and pilot projects could 
flow  from  the  bottom-up  and  be  housed  within  this  region.280  Details 
notwithstanding,  Region  7s  general  frameworkauthorizing  and  facilitating 
experimentation  based  on  pre-established  guidelines  deserves  congressional 
consideration. 

Proposals offered in this context could still have a wilderness component, 
but  the  wilderness  bills  would  be  considered  separately  by  Congress.  Such  a 
process  would  not  preclude  future  negotiated  deals  that  mixed  wilderness 
designation with some type of economic and restoration component. It would 
simply  isolate  the  wilderness  legislation  for  congressional  consideration,  and 
then place some of the  more experimental provisions under some other legal 
authority and structured system. If done in this fashion, wilderness legislation 
would be more straightforward in the future, and there would still be a system 
designed to house alternative approaches to national forest management. This 
design  does  not  provide  the  level  of  certainty  and  stability  sought  by  some 
interests, but as discussed above, we doubt that place-based laws can meet this 
objective anyway. 

New  approaches  to  forest  planning  could  also  be  tested  within  an 
experimental framework. As discussed earlier, widespread dissatisfaction with 
forest planning processes partially explains the growing interest in place-based 
legislation.281  BDP  participants  seem  dissatisfied  with  both  the  1982  and  the 
2005/2008  planning  regulations.  In  the  search  for  binding  commitments  and 
greater predictability, stakeholders now look to Congress rather than a hobbled 
USFS. But like it or not, some type of forest planning is here to stay. Instead of 
abandoning  the  1982  or  2000  planning  regulations  in  favor  of  an  untested 
paradigm  shift  in  planning  found  in  the  2005/2008  regulations,  the  USFS 
could  try  a  series  of  planning  experiments  on  a  smaller  scale.  All  new  ideas 
would  be  housed  within  an  experimental  framework  with  oversight  and 
sideboards. 

A broader-gauged approach is for Congress to revisit forest planning law.

trying  to  achieve  greater  certainty,  among  other  objectives,  via  place-based 
legislation.  This  is  partly  because  of  problems  related  to  NFMA  and  its 
interpretation by the Courts and implementation by the USFS. Hence, if so few 
people seem satisfied with forest planning, then why not make singular changes 
to  NFMA,  rather  than  pass  a  series  of  place-based  laws?  After  all,  Congress 
could  make  the  Courts  decisions  in  Ohio  Forestry  and  SUWA  irrelevant  by 
amending NFMA.282 Instead of focusing on symptoms related to a perceived 
broken planning process, this approach digs deeper to make root-level changes 
to forest planning law. 

Rather  than  pursuing  change  on  a  national  scale,  perhaps  solutions  to 
place-specific  problems  can  be  found  by  experimenting  on  an  even  smaller 
scale. It is certainly possible to carve out some space on the BDNF, even at the 
district  level,  within  which  to  try  some  of  the  things  proposed  by  the 
Partnership. Such an approach would not be landscape-scale, but neither would 
it be so scary to so many different interests. And if it worked as envisioned at 
this smaller scale, it would be easier to jump to something larger in the future. 
The question, then, is why not try something smaller first, monitor the results of 
the carefully screened experiment, and scale-up from there? 

Finally,  though  it  didnt  work  out  in  the  BDP  case  for  various  reasons, 
another  option  is  to  embed  place-based  proposals  into  the  forest  planning 
process for agency consideration. Ideally such proposals could be analyzed by 
the USFS in a NEPA-based planning model. This approach has been used in 
the  past  in  other  contexts.283  For  example,  when  considering  the  proposed 
reintroduction  of  grizzly  bears  into  the  Selway  Bitterroots  of  Montana  and 
Idaho,  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  chose  a  collaboratively  written 
preferred  alternative  that  gave  a  citizen  management  committee  some 
implementation authority.284 The proposal was never implemented, but many 
interests still approve of how the process merged collaboration into the more 
formalized NEPA process.285 

There is also some history of groups submitting their own forest planning 
alternatives  for  agency  consideration,  though  these  efforts  are  not  always 
collaborative or detailed in nature. As discussed above, some interests believe

that forest planning processes are more of a problem than a solution and that 
legislation offers more permanent resolution of issues. Critics also remind us of 
the  tenuous  nature  of  commitments  made  in  forest  plans  and  that  this  option 
still  gives  the  USFS  final  decision-making  authority.  While  true,  it  is  also 
worthwhile  to  consider  how  we  might  combine  the  best  of  place-based 
legislation with the security, rigor, transparency, and public process required of 
NEPA. Most of the place-based proposals reviewed above still require NEPA 
analysis,  but  only  for  projects  that  implement  the  proposed  legislation.  The 
alternative  suggested  here  differs  in  that  it  requires  the  proposal  itself  to  be 
subject to NEPA. 

CONCLUSION 

There  is  increasing  interest  in  place-based  legislative  approaches  to 
national forest management. There are several places in the Northwest where 
divergent  interests  are  negotiating  how  they  would  like  a  particular  national 
forest  to  be  managed.  Most  of  the  proposals  include  provisions  related  to 
wilderness designation, economic development, forest restoration, and funding. 
But  unlike  more  typical  collaborative  efforts,  these  groups  are  seeking 
codification  of  their  agreements.  These  place-based  bills  deserve  serious 
attention  and  debate,  from  the  perspective  of  public  land  law  reform  and 
conflict resolution. The BDP is especially relevant to this inquiry, and we used 
this case to examine some broader issues surrounding the place-based approach 
to national forest management. 

Our analysis shows that several factors precipitate interest in place-based 
legislation.  A  highly  unstable  and  uncertain  political  environment  best 
characterizes contemporary national forest management. 

Political  interests  are  frustrated  for  different  reasons,  but  all  want  more 
certainty  and  predictability  than  offered  by  the  USFS.  Perceptions  of  agency 
gridlock  are  widespread.  The  agencys  planning  process,  management  of 
roadless  areas  and  motorized  recreation,  and  funding  problems,  among  other 
troubles, leave many interests deeply unsatisfied. The status quo is no longer 
tenable  according  to  several  of  those  participating  in  these  initiatives.  These 
interests want more durable solutions that simultaneously deal with wilderness, 
restoration, and struggling timber mills. Place-based laws are being sought in 
this context. Their proponents hope that such laws can finally resolve several 
longstanding  conflicts  while  advancing  a  more  constructive  vision  of 
conservation and community. 

There  is  some  history  of  using  place-based  legislation  in  federal  lands 
management.  Unit-specific  enabling  laws  characterize  management  of  the 
national  parks  and  wildlife  refuges.  These  systems  are  generally  governed 
under  the  terms  of  their  establishment  acts  and  broader  organic  legislation. 
Unlike these systems, the national forests are managed under a more uniform

set of laws, from the 1897 Organic Act to NFMA.286 But our review shows that 
place-based  laws  have  also  been  applied  occasionally  to  the  national  forests. 
Such  laws  come  in  a  variety  of  forms,  from  legislated  protected  land  use 
designations to more complex laws like the Tongass Timber Reform Act and 
the Herger-Feinstein Act.287 

There  is  nothing  inherently  wrong  with  seeking  legislated  solutions  to 
forest management, like those in Alaska and California. Political choices about 
resource  allocation  are  entirely  appropriate  for  congressional  resolution.  We 
thus  find  some  criticism  leveled  at  the  BDP  and  other  place-based  proposals 
unwarranted.  One  strength  of  the  place-based  approach  is  that  it  allows 
conflicts to be resolved from the bottom-up, but then legitimized by an Act of 
Congressso we get the rule of law, but we get that law individually tailored 
and  place-specific.288  And  in  theory,  Congress  will  ensure  that  the  national 
interest is represented. 

All of the initiatives discussed here are admirable in their efforts to secure 
broader-based  solutions  and  conservation  strategies  that  advance  wilderness, 
restoration,  and  a  sustainable  timber  industry.  Whether  passed  or  not,  these 
place-based proposals also advance our thinking about national forest reform
from the bottom up. We also applaud these initiatives for confronting some of 
the  most  controversial  issues  in  forest  management  in  a  straightforward 
fashion. If lawmakers do ever revisit NFMA, they should first study how place-
based groups have approached the relevant issues. 

While we are not opposed to place-based legislation in principle, we hope 
the aforementioned questions will be answered before the approach is adopted 
more broadly. Of particular concern to us is the precedent that could be set by 
these bills. If history is any guide, passage of place-based laws will generate 
wider interest in the approach, and future bills may not be carefully balanced 
and constructed. We would like to see greater assurances that future bills will 
not be used to undermine federal environmental law and to devolve control of 
federal lands to self-selected stakeholders. 

The question of how these initiatives will fit into the larger legal structure 
also deserves more scrutiny. Simply adding another mandate for the USFS to 
implement,  while  retaining  NEPA  and  other  legal  responsibilities,  could 
increase frustration with and within the agency. Funding these initiatives is also 
a concern. Stewardship contracting was never designed to serve as the primary 
funding stream for the USFS, and it should not be treated as such. And though 
each place-based proposal may make financial sense when viewed in isolation, 
what effect would a proliferation of place-based laws have on the USFS budget 
in general?

ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY 

[Vol. 37:1 

The intent of this Article is to provide a preliminary assessment of place-
based  legislation  and to ask  questions  that  will help guide  future debate.  We 
have  certainly  asked  more  questions  than  provided  answers,  and  we  plan  on 
addressing some of the issues raised here in future work. Whether or not place-
based proposals like the BDP become law, these initiatives are worthy of study 
and scrutiny because of the lessons and opportunities they provide. They place 
front-and-center  issues  that  deserve  immediate  attention,  like  the  fate  of 
inventoried  roadless  areas,  the  growth  of  motorized  recreation,  forest 
restoration  needs,  agency  funding  woes,  and  the  disarray  that  currently 
characterizes  forest  planning.  Though  not  without  problems  and  challenges, 
place-based approaches provide detailed alternatives to the status quo and shift 
the debate over forest management in significant ways. 

AFTERWORD 

Shortly  after  this  Article  was  accepted  for  publication,  Montana  Senator 
Jon  Tester  introduced  Senate  Bill  No.  1470,  the  Forest  Jobs  and  Recreation 
Act (FJRA).289 The bill includes three place-based proposals reviewed in our 
Article: the BDP proposal,290 the Three Rivers Challenge focused on part of 
the  Kootenai  National  Forest,291  and  the  relatively  modest  Blackfoot-
Clearwater  Landscape  Stewardship  Project  dealing  with  part  of  the  Lolo 
National Forest.292 The Senator modified some of these agreements and then 
lumped them together into one multi-faceted bill that has generated a vigorous 
debate in the region.293 

Some of the bills major provisions include those we outlined in Part II.B: 
wilderness  and  protected  land  use  designations,  a  timber  supply  mandate, 
restoration objectives, and the use of stewardship contracting.294 It first seeks to 
designate  roughly  677,000  acres  of  wilderness  and  336,000  acres  of  special 
management  areas  in  the  three  national  forests,  with  the  latter  designed  to 
protect  some  places  from  resource  use  while  allowing  and  enhancing  some 
types of motorized use.295 In exchange for these designations, the bill mandates 
 
  289.  Forest Jobs and Recreation Act of 2009, S. 1470, 111th Cong. (2009). For more about the bill,

PLACE-BASED LEGISLATION 

51 

that  70,000  acres  on  the  Beaverhead-Deerlodge  and  30,000  acres  on  the 
Kootenai  are  to  be  mechanically  treated  by  the  USFS  over  the  next  ten 
years.296  Priorities  and  sideboards  are  set  for  where  these  projects  can 
happen,297 so they will most likely be funneled into the roaded front country. 
Non-timber related restoration goals are set in the bill, though compared to the 
treatment mandate, they are not quantified nor prescribed in as much detail.298 
Also worked into the legislation is funding for a biomass project for a timber 
mill in the Seeley-Swan Valley.299 And finally, just like the BDP proposal, the 
bill  relies  heavily  upon  the  use  of  stewardship  contracting  to  achieve  its 
treatments  and  restoration  work,  though  it  also  authorizes  other  spending  to 
meet its purposes.300 

The Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests held a hearing on 
S.  1470  in  December  2009.301  As  expected,  members  of  the  Beaverhead-
Deerlodge  Partnership  proposal  testified  in  favor  of  S.  1470.302  But  the  bill 
received a more critical reception by Harris Sherman, representing the USFS as 
Undersecretary  of  Agriculture.303  He  raised  several  questions  that  were 
analyzed in Part III of this Article. 

The Subcommittees ranking member, Ron Wyden of Oregon, expressed a 
particular  interest  in  Senator  Testers  bill.  This  is  partly  because  Senator 
Wyden  has  proposed  his  own  place-specific  national  forest  law:  the  Oregon 
Eastside Forests Restoration, Old Growth Protection, and Jobs Act of 2009.304 
The bill sets new management goals and processes for six national forests in 
eastern Oregon, covering nearly ten million acres. As this Article goes to press, 
the fates of both bills remain uncertain.
