Summary 

The  second  MAES  report  presents  indicators  that  can  be  used  at  European  and 
Member  State's  level  to  map  and  assess  biodiversity,  ecosystem  condition  and 
ecosystem  services  according  to  the  Common  International  Classification  of 
Ecosystem Services (CICES v4.3).  

This  work  is  based  on  a  review  of  data  and  indicators  available  at  national  and 
European level and is applying the MAES analytical framework adopted in 2013.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

Action 5 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 foresees that Member States will, with the assistance of the 
Commission,  map  and  assess  the  state  of  ecosystems  and  their  services  in  their  national  territory  by  2014. 
Following the adoption of an analytical framework, the Working Group MAES, which steers the implementation of 
Action 5 decided to test it based on the outcomes of six thematic pilots.  

Four of the pilots focused on Europes main ecosystem types: agro-ecosystems, forest ecosystems, freshwater 
ecosystems and marine ecosystems. A further pilot focused on the use of conservation status data for assessing 
the state of ecosystems and of the associated delivery of services. The final pilot addressed the challenge of 
natural capital accounts.  

In these pilots EU services worked hand in hand with Member States to make a review of national and European 
data and indicators to assess the condition of ecosystems, to quantify biodiversity and to map and assess their 
services.  

The pilot studies contributed indicators, which can be used for mapping and assessing biodiversity, ecosystem 
condition  and  ecosystem  services  according  to  the  Common  International  Classification  of  Ecosystem  Services 
(CICES v4.3). The way information is structured is presented in a graph.

Quick guidance for mapping and assessing ecosystems and their services 

 
 

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

A first European map of ecosystems according to the MAES typology is provided in Chapter 3.  

Indicators for the assessment of biodiversity and condition are presented in Chapter 4. Two pieces of 
information  are  provided:  a  set  of  available  indicators  based  on  the  four  thematic  pilot  studies,  which  is 
complemented by a review of information that is available at EU scale. 

Indicators for the assessment of ecosystem services are presented in Chapter 5. This chapter reports in 
detail  on  the  selection  of  indicators  per  ecosystem  type  (or  per  pilot  study).  This  information  can  be  used  by 
Member  States  in  at  least  two  possible  ways.  Firstly,  all  information  is  available  per  ecosystem  type,  which 
enables  an  in-depth  assessment  of  services  provided  by  priority  ecosystems.  Indicator  colour  codes  identify 
strengths, weaknesses and possible data gaps offering additional information to users in terms of applicability 
and  representativeness  of  each  indicator.  Secondly,  this  report  presents  a  synthesis  table,  which  contains 
indicators that are spatially explicit and readily available at national and EU scale. This indicator set is designed 
in  such  a  way  that  they  assess  ecosystem  services  delivered  by  the  most  important  supplying  ecosystems. 
Depending on the availability of the data, this table can be used for a rapid assessment of ecosystem services at 
national scale. 

Chapter 6 of this report summarised the progress made on natural capital accounting. 

Chapter  7  elaborates  further  on  mapping  issues.  In  particular,  this  report  introduces  a  tiered  mapping 
approach from simple to complex on how to map ecosystem services. Tier 1 is strongly based on land cover 
land use information and involves the use of the ecosystem map presented in this report. Tier 2 is based on the 
mapping of indicators on land cover data. Tier 3 refers to a modelling approach.  

Importantly, the authors stress the pilot-based approach of this study, which is exclusively built on the voluntary 
contributions  of  participating  Member  States  and  EU  services.  Clearly,  some  Member  States  have  made 
substantially more progress in the development of an indicator framework for ecosystem assessment than is 
reported in this report. The MAES analytical framework developed in 2013 was designed to accommodate to a 
large extent the views and concepts of leading Member States so that their assessments serve as examples of 
good practise.  

This  report  provides  working  guidance  on  suitable  approaches  for  the  Member  States  for  mapping  and 
assessment based on spatial information and indicators. Therefore, the experience arising from the application of 
currently available methods and indicators is open for commenting and will be reviewed again in 2015.  

The outcome of this report is reflecting the best-available assessment of suitable data sets and 
indicators  for  mapping  and  assessing  ecosystems  and  their  services  under  Action  5  of  the  EU 
Biodiversity  Strategy.  Nevertheless,  the  recommendations  for  the  use  of  maps  and  indicators 
presented here should be taken as a first working version on which feedback is welcome in order 
to continue improving guidance to Member States.

1  INTRODUCTION 

1.1  Context 
Action 5 of the Biodiversity Strategy foresees that Member States will, with the assistance of the Commission, 
map  and  assess  the  state  of  ecosystems  and  their  services  in  their  national  territory  by  2014,  assess  the 
economic  value  of  such  services,  and  promote  the  integration  of  these  values  into  accounting  and  reporting 
systems at EU and national level by 2020.  

The Working Group on Mapping and Assessment on Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) is mandated to co-
ordinate and oversee Action 5. In 2012, the working group developed ideas for a coherent analytical framework 
to ensure consistent approaches are used. The report adopted in April 2013 (1) proposes a conceptual framework 
linking biodiversity, ecosystem condition and ecosystem services to human well-being. Furthermore, it develops a 
typology for ecosystems in Europe and promotes the CICES1 classification for ecosystem services.  

Following the adoption of the analytical framework, the Working Group MAES decided to test it and in order to do 
so set up six thematic pilots. Four of the pilots focused on the main ecosystem types: agro-ecosystems (cropland 
and grassland), forest ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems (rivers, lakes, groundwater and wetlands), and marine 
ecosystems (transitional waters and marine inlets, coastal ecosystems, the shelf, the open ocean). A further pilot 
focused on the use of conservation status assessment data (cf. under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive) for 
assessing the condition of ecosystems and of the associated delivery of services. The final pilot addressed the 
challenge  of  natural  capital  accounts,  which  is  an  important  part  of  Action  5  of  the  EU  2020  Biodiversity 
Strategy.  These  themes  were  in  line  with  the  recommendations  from  the  2012  MAES  Stakeholder  workshop2 
where Member States expressed their priorities for activities under Action 5 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. 
All pilots build on the MAES Analytical Framework and the proposed ecosystem typology and ecosystem service 
classification  and  on  the  activities  and  information  available  from  Member  States,  the  European  Commission 
Services and the European Environment Agency (EEA). 

This report provides working guidance to the Member States on how to map and assess the state of 
ecosystems and of their services, based on the outcomes of the pilot studies. The outcome of this 
report  is  considered  to  be  based  on  the  best-available  assessment  of  suitable  data  sets  and

indicators. Nevertheless, the outcomes presented here should be taken as a first working version on 
which feedback is awaited that will be reflected in future versions.  

1.2  The importance of MAES and Action 5 
The work being carried out on the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and ecosystem services is important 
for  the  advancement  of  biodiversity  objectives,  and  also  to  inform  the  development  and  implementation  of 
related  policies,  on  water,  climate,  agriculture,  forest,  and  regional  planning  (Fig.  1).  Robust,  reliable  and 
comparable data are also important for the planning and implementation of individual projects.

1.2.1  Biodiversity policy 
The  mapping  and  assessment  of  ecosystems  and  their  services  is  an  essential  part  of  the  EU  Biodiversity 
Strategy to 2020 and a necessary condition to make ecosystems and their services key parameters informing 
planning and development processes and decisions.   

High  quality  and  consistent  information  on  the  condition  of  ecosystems  and  the  services  provided  by  those 
ecosystems  will  be  needed  in  order  to  identify  priorities  for  restoration,  support  the  deployment  of  Green 
Infrastructure and enable the development of a No Net Loss initiative (actions 6a, 6b and 7b of the EU 2020 
Biodiversity Strategy).

1.2.2  Common Agricultural Policy 
Target 3 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy addresses the integration of biodiversity concerns into the development 
and implementation of EU policy on Agriculture and Forestry. Agriculture is a major land use in the EU28, covering 
about  47%  of  the  land  surface.  The Common  Agricultural  Policy  (CAP)  is entering  a  new  programming  period 
(2014-2020),  with  the  introduction  of  an  enhanced  environmental  component  in  Pillar  1  of  the  CAP  (income 
support to farmers). In the revised CAP, 30% of direct payments are allocated to green measures predominantly 
focussed on the following three actions: 

  Maintenance of permanent grassland; 
  Crop diversification: a farmer must cultivate at least 2 crops when the arable land exceeds 10 hectares 
and at least 3 crops when the arable land exceeds 30 hectares. The main crop may cover at most 75% 
of arable land, and the two main crops at most 95% of the arable area; 

  Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs): at least 5% of the arable area of holdings with an arable area larger than 
15 hectares must be allocated to EFAs (i.e. field margins, hedges, trees, fallow land, landscape features, 
biotopes, buffer strips, afforested area). This figure may rise to 7% after reporting from the European 
Union in 2017 and subject to a legislative proposal. 

Furthermore, under Pillar II (Rural Development) of the revised CAP there are three long-term strategic objectives 
in the programming period 2014-202, one of which is the sustainable management of natural resources and 
climate action. This over-arching objective is further broken down into six priorities, one of which is Restoring, 
preserving and enhancing ecosystems dependent on agriculture and forestry. The focus areas identified under 
this priority area are: 

  Restoring, preserving and enhancing biodiversity, including Natura 2000 areas, areas facing natural or 

other specific constraints, High Nature Value farmland, and the state of European landscapes;  
Improving water management, including fertiliser and pesticide management; 

 
  Preventing soil erosion and improving soil management. 

In the light  of the green elements that are now included in the programming period 2014-2020, the new CAP is 
expected  to  actively  contribute  to  maintaining  the  rural  landscape,  to  combating  biodiversity  loss  and  to 
mitigating/adapting  to climate change  (COM(2010) 672 final).  

By  providing  the  information  needed  to  characterise  agricultural  lands  in  terms  of  the  provision  of  multiple 
ecosystem services and the maintenance and enhancement of biodiversity, the MAES process can facilitate and 
enable the delivery of the green elements of the revised CAP.  Moreover, besides information on provisioning 
ecosystem services in terms of agricultural production, the role of agro-ecosystems in supplying regulating and 
cultural ecosystem services will be made explicit through the MAES process. This can support the discussion on 
public  goods  provided  by  agriculture  and  the  assessment  of  trade-offs  for  a  better  use  of  resources  and  an 
improved  spatial  targeting  of  policy  measures  (2).    The  results  from  the  MAES  initiative  will  also  enable  the 
identification  of  areas  where  regulating  ecosystem  services  supporting  agricultural  production  (e.g.  pollination, 
bio-control)  should  be  enhanced  (3).  Finally,  synergies  between  greening  measures,  in  particular  Ecological 
Focus Areas, and the deployment of the Green Infrastructure in agricultural landscapes can be identified.

1.2.3  Forest policy 
Forests  cover  around  40%  of  the  EU  land  surface.  The  many  interlinked  roles  of  forest,  from  biodiversity 
conservation to timber provision, explain the multi-sectoral and multi-objective character of forest policies. There 
is  a  long  history  of  EU  measures  supporting  forest-related  activities  contributing  to  implementing  sustainable 
forest  management:  coordination  with  Member  States  is  developed  mainly  through  the  Standing  Forestry 
Committee (SFC).  

In September 2013, a new EU Forest Strategy for forest and the forest-based sector3 was presented with a new 
framework  and  wider  scope  in  which  forest  protection,  biodiversity  conservation  and  the  sustainable  use  and 
delivery of forest ecosystem services are addressed. Under the Strategy, sustainable forest management (SFM) is 
defined  following  MCPFE4  criteria:  SFM  means  using  forests  and  forest  land  in  a  way,  and  at  a  rate,  that 
maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the 
future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not 
cause damage to other ecosystems.  SFM addresses current pressures on European forests from two different 
angles. Firstly, threats from environmental changes are expected to increase in the next years and decades, such 
as increasing water scarcity and pests, spread of invasive alien species, habitat loss, increased risk of forest fires, 
etc. Secondly, human-induced pressures such as forest fragmentation and over-exploitation of forest resources 
could impact negatively the provision, health and vitality of forest ecosystems. With this in mind the new Forest 
Strategy promotes a coherent and holistic approach of forest management covering i) the multiple benefits and 
services of forests;  ii) internal and external forest-policy issues and iii)  the complete forest value-chain. From 
this  perspective  assessing,  mapping  and  accounting  of  forest  ecosystem  services  as  foreseen  under  MAES, 
provides  an  integrated  and  systemic  view  of  the  forest  system  and  the  interlinked  effects  of  the  different 
pressures on forests. Ensuring forest protection and the delivery of forest ecosystem services is the overarching 
aim of the Strategy. 

1.2.4  Water policy 
The MAES initiative is strongly linked to the implementation of EU legislation on freshwater resources, recently 
reviewed and synthesised in the Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources5.  The effective implementation 
of  legislation  such  as  the  Water  Framework  Directive,  the  Groundwater  Directive  and  the  Floods  Directive  is 
sustained by high quality and comprehensive information on the quantity and quality of freshwater resources. 
This legislation has extensive provisions for the collection and reporting of this information. The MAES process 
will serve to integrate this information into a wider assessment of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services 
covering  all  ecosystem  types.  The  outputs  from  the  MAES  process  will  complement  the  information  currently 
available on freshwater resources and facilitate a more effective protection and management of those resources.  
In the light of the mutual interests and common concerns, the Nature and Water Directors of the Member States 
have invited the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and the EEA to review, by mid-2014 the 
linkages  between  the  mapping  and  assessment  of  ecosystems  and  of  their  services  (MAES)  and  the  work

undertaken  under  the  Water  Legislation  and  to  make  recommendations  concerning  the  priority  operational 
actions that should be taken to improve integration and promote synergies. 

1.2.5  Climate action 
Healthy, productive and resilient ecosystems are also essential if we are to combat climate change effectively. 
Current  EU  Biodiversity  policy  identifies  carbon  sequestration  and  the  important  role  that  ecosystems  play  in 
mitigating  climate  change  and  adapting  to  its  impacts  as  essential  ecosystem  services.  The  recent 
communication on climate change adaptation6 places considerable emphasis on nature-based solutions. There 
are strong synergies between the policies on climate change and biodiversity. The work being carried out under 
MAES will allow us to know more about the condition of Europes ecosystems and to identify opportunities for 
increasing  the  contribution  to  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation.  In  particular,  the  mapping  and 
assessment  of  several  protective  functions  of  ecosystems  preventing  downstream  and  coastal  flooding  or 
droughts are clear examples of how increased knowledge on the current distribution and state of ecosystems and 
their services helps support climate adaptation.  

1.2.6  Marine policy 
Marine and coastal ecosystems provide an essential contribution to human wellbeing in multiple ways. From a 
European policy perspective, increasing threats to the marine environment resulting from human use have been 
recognized, and a number of policies are in place, aiming at managing/reducing the impact of human activities on 
the marine environment. 

The  Marine  Strategy  Framework  Directive  (MSFD)  is  the  latest  and  foremost  piece  of  legislation,  focusing  on 
achieving/maintaining good environmental status (GES) of European marine waters by 2020. The MSFD requires 
an assessment on the use of marine environments and the development of action plans and explicit measures to 
achieve  GES.  Before  their  adoption,  robustness  of  these  measures  needs  to  be  determined,  inter  alia,  though 
cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. MSFD has also a strong link with the Habitats and Birds Directives, 
which provide the legal basis for the designation of marine protected areas. This linkage lends further strength to 
the need for the application of spatially based conservation measures to protect marine biodiversity in marine 
environments, both at EU and global level.  

Criteria set down in the MSFD for the attainment of GES build upon existing obligations arising directly from the 
Water Framework Directive (WFD), under which umbrella fall transitional and coastal waters. In this sense, for 
example, the initial assessment of the environmental status of marine waters under the MSFD must take into 
account the results of the assessment of coastal and transitional waters under the WFD. Similarly, the program 
of measures adopted by Member States (MS) as part of their marine strategies to achieve GES must take into 
account relevant measures already adopted under the WFD.  

Among  others,  the  MSFD  is  aimed  at  fulfilling  a  number  of  obligations  that  arise  under  the  United  Nations 
Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS),  namely  the  protection  and  preservation  rare  and/or  fragile 
ecosystems as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered forms of marine life. On a regional 
basis,  the  MSFD  is  complemented  by  the  obligations  set  forth  under  a  number  of  regional  agreements  (the 
Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, the Convention for the Protection

Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean 
Sea Against Pollution from Land-Based Sources). Such conventions can provide a wealth of data and information 
relevant to the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and the services they provide. Thus knowledge made 
available  through  the  data  gathering  and  reporting  associated  with  the  MSFD,  the  WFD  and  other  nature 
legislation  (not  to  mention  the  various  Regional  Sea  Conventions)  complements  data  collection  and  reporting 
under the MAES process, enhancing and facilitating harmonised policy and decision making. 

Target  4  of  the  EU  2020  Biodiversity  Strategy  also  concerns  the  integration  of  biodiversity  issues  into  the 
development  and  implementation  of  EU  Maritime  and  Fisheries  policy.  Information  coming  from  the  full 
implementation  of  the  Maritime  and  (new)  Fisheries  Policy  will  be  paramount  for  the  build-up  of  a  detailed 
knowledge  base  in  view  of  the  full  implementation  of  target  4  of  the  Biodiversity  Strategy.  In  particular,  the 
Integrated  Maritime  Policy  aims  to  provide  a  coherent  approach  to  maritime  issues,  increasing  coordination 
between  cross-cutting  policies,  such  as  blue  growth,  marine  data  and  knowledge,  maritime  spatial  planning, 
integrated  maritime  surveillance.  In  relation  to  fisheries  management  (the  MSFD  limiting  the  power  of  MS  to 
making  recommendations  to  the  Commission  when  action  cannot  be  taken  at  a  national  level  and  where  EU 
measures  are  needed),  the  latest  CFP  (effective  since  1  January  2014)  aims  to  bring  fish  stocks  back  to 
sustainable levels and put an end to wasteful fishing practices. The CFP provides for the adoption of a broad 
range  of  EU  legal  measures  concerning,  inter  alia  the  management  of  living  aquatic  resources  and  technical 
restrictions on the environmental impact of fishing. It is already foreseen that achieving the objectives of the 
MSFD  may  entail  the  adoption  of  additional  fisheries  management  measures  under  the  CFP,  with  a  view  to 
maintaining or restoring fish stocks, as well as to ensure the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Indeed, one 
of the qualitative criteria for determining GES under the MSFD is focused on ensuring that the populations of all 
commercially  exploited  fish  and  shellfish  are  within  safe  biological  limits  and  exhibit  characteristics  that  are 
consistent with healthy stocks. 

The success of EU Maritime and Fisheries policy is inextricably linked to the health and resilience of the natural 
systems that sustain our economic activities. Reporting from this policy will also contribute to the gathering of 
high quality and reliable information for the assessment of the condition of European marine ecosystems and the 
services that these ecosystems provide. Although the harmonisation of marine and maritime policy at EU level in 
terms of objectives and data requirements is still far from complete, the MAES process will complement the data 
collection and reporting activities under the individual pieces of legislation and will enhance and facilitate joined-
up decision taking and policy making. 

1.2.7  Regional policy 
Working  with  nature  can  offer  cost-effective  solutions  to  many  of  the  challenges  facing  society  such  as 
adaptation to climate change, protection against extreme weather events and natural disasters, increased food 
and  water  security,  better  living  conditions,  improved  social  cohesion  as  well  as  business  and  development 
opportunities.  Optimising  the  delivery  of  these  ecosystem  services  will  contribute  significantly  to  regional  and 
urban development across the Union. High quality and consistent data on the condition of our ecosystems and 
the services that they produce is essential for making the right decisions for future investments and the MAES 
initiative will play a major role in ensuring the timely provision of such data.

1.2.8  Research  
The  on-going  efforts  on  the  mapping  and  assessment  of  ecosystems  and  ecosystem  services  are  totally 
dependent  upon  reliable  data  and  good  science.  This  action  needs  to  integrate  growing  scientific  evidence  on 
biodiversity as a key component for resilient ecosystems and delivery of ecosystem services. It is the basis for 
valuing the multifunctionality of ecosystems for sustaining long-term human well-being. The integration of these 
concerns in the Horizon 2020 research programme and the further engagement with the scientific community 
will strengthen the knowledge and evidence base for policy and decision-making.  

1.3  Experience based on country cases 
DG Environment supports the practical implementation of Action 5 in the Member States not only via the working 
group MAES but additionally through a service contract (MESEU - Mapping of Ecosystems and their Services in 
the EU and its Member States). The aim of this contract is to provide assistance on mapping and assessment of 
the state of ecosystems and their services in their national territories by making the best use of studies and work 
already  undertaken  at  EU  and  MS  levels.  A  first  report7  provides  an  analysis  of  several  ongoing  or  recently 
completed ecosystem assessments in Europe. The country cases are Wales (UK), Flanders and Wallonia (Belgium), 
Spain, Austria, Switzerland, the Wadden Sea (The Netherlands), and several Balkan countries.  The most important 
outcomes from the country cases are the following: 

  The degree of engagement of national governments varies widely across the Member States. Only in the 
case  of  Spain  and  the  UK  were  ecosystem  assessments  undertaken  on  the  basis  of  a  national 
government initiative.  Therefore, Action 5 can be seen as an incentive for other countries to 
engage biodiversity policy departments and agencies.  

  The  country  case  studies  provide  a  useful  body  of  material.  However,  frameworks,  indicators  and 
quantification methods differ widely and comparisons across the different case studies are therefore 
very  difficult.  The  hierarchical  structure  of  the  CICES  classification  for  ecosystem  services 
facilitates  the  translation  of  available  data  and  results 
in  a  common  European 
classification8.  

  All the case studies used land cover/ land use data as a basis for mapping. In many cases, this was 
combined  with  other,  more  detailed  layers  to  map  or  model  particular  ecosystems.  The  present 
document  provides  a  link  to  a  pan-European  ecosystem  map  that  can  be  used  for  spatial 
ecosystem assessments (see chapter 3). 

  Mapping  precision  and  accuracy  depend  on  time  and  material  resources  and  data  availability.  The 
tiered approach to mapping and assessment based on the MESEU project results is adapted 
to accommodate the different situations in the Member States (see chapter 7).

http://openness.hugin.com/example/cices. It translates CICES to other classifications including MA and 
TEEB. Also the first MAES paper (1) includes a cross walk between the different classification systems.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

In  the  context  of  the  MESEU  contract  a  survey  was  carried  out  of  Member  States  assessments  of  their  own 
needs  in  relation  to  the  work  on  mapping  and  assessment  of  ecosystems  and  ecosystem  services.  Box  1 
summarizes the most important results.  

Box 1. Where is guidance most useful. Outcomes from survey of the Member States

Mapping and assessment is an ongoing process in most of the countries but needs targeted support. From the 15 
countries responding: 

About 80% have started the MAES process at national level, regional or case-study level. 

 
  Mapping is already happening, but not uniformly developed; 
 
 

80% include stakeholders in the assessment (policy makers, NGOs, scientists, citizens, etc.). 
Expertise is available but government (financial) support and EU based guidance (e.g. a common approach) are needed. 

Methods: The main ecosystems and ecosystem services are covered using national data as well as European sources. 
In particular the CICES classification and CORINE Land Cover are used. The main problems encountered are lack of 
consistent approaches among all parties involved, lack of relevant data and limited resources. Based on the replies 
from the 15 responding countries, the results of the survey led to the following conclusions:: 

  National assessments mostly cover forests, followed by agro-ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems and marine 

ecosystems. Other ecosystems mentioned are: urban systems, heathland, mountains, arid zones, and peat-lands (as part 
of wetlands). 
The most assessed ecosystem services are cultural services (tourism and recreation), followed by provisioning services 
(nutrition and materials such as timber) and regulating and maintenance services (regulation of water flows, climate 
and extreme events). 
Indicators are mainly based on national statistics; 
Common approaches across the EU are the CICES classification (60%), the CORINE Land Cover dataset and the reporting 
streams under the EU environmental directives. 

 

 
 

Technical aspects: guidance is needed. From the 15 replies of the responding countries, the following needs were expressed: 

Guidance is needed with respect to methods for mapping and assessment including GIS methods and data sources for 
mapping and assessment; 
The common elements in mapping approaches are the use of land cover/ land use data and the use of ESRIs ArcGIS.  
The INSPIRE directive is not yet considered when mapping. 

 

 
 

 

1.3.1  Key challenges 
This report aims to synthesise what information is available at EU and Member State scales in terms of data and 
indicators in order to facilitate Member States' work when:  

identifying and prioritising which ecosystems and services to map and assess; 
identifying what data are available or needed; 

 
 
  making optimal use of EU environmental reporting streams; 
  helping implement other actions of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy; 
  guiding the use of information on ecosystem services in impact assessments or in other policies; 
 

linking biodiversity and ecosystem condition to ecosystem services and human well-being.

1.4  Structure of the report 
The report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 introduces the readers to the collaborative efforts of the Member 
States and EU services in order to identify the data and indicators that can be used to report under Action 5. 
Chapters 3 to 6 report on the outcomes of the work on ecosystem mapping, assessment of biodiversity and 
ecosystem condition, and assessment of ecosystem services, respectively. Chapter 7 introduces the readers to 
ongoing efforts to account for natural capital. Chapter 8 builds on the previous chapters to support Member 
States with their national assessments. Chapter 9, finally, sums up the essential conclusions and next steps.

2  THE SIX PILOTS AND THE COMMON ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK  

2.1  Set up and description of the pilot studies 
Participation from Member States, stakeholders and EU bodies (EC, EEA) in the pilots was made on a volunteer 
basis  with  a  view  to  draw  on  existing  initiatives  and  resources  that  could  be  used  to  measure  or  monitor 
biodiversity, ecosystem condition and ecosystem services at national and European scales. Each pilot was co-led 
by a Member State and an EU body. Table 1 provides the list of contributing parties including some stakeholders 
who  commented  on  the  outcomes  or  who  provided  additional  information  with  regard  to  indicators  and  data 
sources.

2.2  A common approach for the ecosystem pilots 
The MAES conceptual model builds on the premise that the delivery of certain ecosystem services upon which we 
rely  for  our  socio-economic  development  and  long-term  human  well-being  is  strongly  dependent  on  both  the 
spatial  accessibility  of  ecosystems  as  well  as  on  ecosystem  condition.  This  working  hypothesis  has  been 
translated into a working structure that has been adopted to guide the work of the ecosystem pilot cases (Figure 
2).  In  order  to  provide  operational  recommendations  to  both  EU  and  its  Member  States,  the  proposed  work 
structure for the 4 ecosystem pilots is based on a 4 step approach: (i) Mapping of the concerned ecosystem; (ii) 
Assessment of the condition of the ecosystem; (iii) Quantification of the services provided by the ecosystem; and 
(iv) Compilation of these into an integrated ecosystem assessment (Figure 2).

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

 Map ecosystems: Identification of data for ecosystem mapping 

2.2.1 
The 1st MAES report (1) proposes a typology for ecosystem mapping based on the key databases available at EU 
level. At the same time, the typology should allow integration of assessments on national or sub-national levels 
based on more detailed classifications. The mapping of ecosystems is largely dependent on the availability of 
land-cover/land-use datasets at various spatial resolutions. The most comprehensive dataset for terrestrial and 
freshwater ecosystems at EU level is Corine Land Cover (CLC). The CLC dataset allows also mapping of one of 
the four marine ecosystems (marine inlets and transitional waters). For the marine environment, the 1st MAES 
report  (1)  contained  a  proposal  to  define  marine  ecosystem  typology  solely  on  the  base  of  bathymetry  (2D 
approach). Such a rough criterion would be then complemented by other available information, at EU or MS level. 
To date, EuSeaMap provides basic information for ecosystem mapping and assessment but does not yet cover all 
European marine regions. However, any mapping should not be limited to the availability of land and sea cover 
data only, neither at EU nor at MS level. Ecosystem mapping needs to be based on the best available data from 
sub-national and national data sources at appropriate scales, to provide coherent information about ecosystems 
and their characteristics additional to EU level data. 

2.2.2  Assess the condition of ecosystems: Review of data and indicators for ecosystem 

assessment 

The  EU  wide  assessment  of  the  condition  of  the  various  ecosystem  types  requires  information  about  drivers, 
mainly land/sea use and management, and pressures such as land-take, fragmentation, pollution, climate change 
as well as their impacts on the structure and function of each ecosystem type. It should make use of existing 
data, mainly the reported data under EU legislation and, in particular, from assessments under Art. 17 of the 
Habitats  Directive  and  Art.  12  of  the  Birds  Directive,  the  Water  Framework  Directive,  the  Marine  Strategy 
Framework  Directive  and  other  environmental  legislation.  For  ecosystems  without  legislative  reporting 
framework, such as forests, either national data or European monitoring data, e.g. from the European Forest Data 
Centre (EFDAC)9 or the Copernicus programme can be used. To complete and refine the ecosystem assessment, 
additional information indicating habitat connectivity or other functionalities as well as information on drivers 
and pressures reducing the capacity of ecosystems to provide services is needed and must be integrated in the 
assessment.  Again,  national  and  sub-national  data  sources  need  to  be  used  to  provide  more  detailed  and 
additional information to describe the variability of ecosystem condition across Europe. 

2.2.3 

 Map and assess ecosystem services: Reference frame for ecosystem services 
mapping and assessment. 

The 1st MAES report (1) proposed the CICES v4.3 classification as typology for ecosystem services to ensure a 
coherent  approach  across  EU  Member  States  and  to  support  their  integration  into  (ecosystem)  accounting 
systems. The four ecosystem pilots have used this classification to organise the data collection and to compare 
outcomes.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

2.2.4 

Integration of the two assessments: Reference frame linking condition of 
ecosystems to their services. 

The  capacity  of  an  ecosystem  to  deliver  different  ecosystem  services  is  related  to  the  condition  of  this 
ecosystem. In a healthy state, an ecosystem may provide more and a sustained flow of a variety of services- 
compared to an ecosystem, which is managed to provide only a maximum amount of one specific service, e.g. 
fish,  crops  or  timber.  As  a  result,  the  overall  capacity  of  such  a  system  to  provide  services  will  be  higher. 
Ecosystems in a healthy state are considered resilient systems, which are able to recover after disturbance and 
they are generally characterized by higher species diversity and a balanced trophic community.  

Every ecosystem delivers multiple services. The mapping work is therefore not targeted to identify the maximum 
potential of one service but to understand the spatial delivery of multiple services by interconnected ecosystems.  

The capacity of an ecosystem to deliver ecosystem services should be measurable in quantitative units.  

2.2.5  Working procedure 
The  four  thematic  pilots  followed  a  coordinated  approach  for  information  gathering,  review  and  compiling  of 
indicator lists. The approach is structured around four main steps.  

Firstly,  the  Pilot  leaders  applied  a  table  (referred  to  hereafter  as  the  MAES  matrix)  including  all  ecosystem 
services  using  CICES  v4.3  as  baseline  classification.  An  EU-wide  MAES  matrix  of  ecosystem  services  was 
populated  from  a  literature  review  and  assessing  data  and  indicators  available  in  the  European  data  centres. 
After completion and agreement with the Pilot leaders, this matrix was sent to participating Commission services 
and stakeholders for review, addition of further data and agreement. 

In a second step, participant MS and stakeholders from international and national organisations were requested 
to populate a country-level MAES matrix with relevant data and indicators available in their country. The resulting 
MAES matrices are available in CIRCABC.  

The high level of detail and wide scope of the pilots yielded MAES matrices that required a supplementary level 
of synthesis for better access and readability. Thus, in a third step a series of MAES cards were implemented 
representing  a  synthesis  of the  information  collected by  the  European  and  country-level  MAES  matrices.  Each 
card focussed on one service at a time and includes information on four aspects: reporting body, data availability 
of  the  indicator  (six  levels),  units  of  measurement  and  compiling  agency.  The  cards  are  more  accessible  and 
readable than the information included in the MAES matrices. The cards of the ecosystem pilots are included in 
a separate supplement to this report10 and could be used as a  screening tool for deciding what indicators are 
available for mapping and assessing biodiversity, ecosystem condition and ecosystem services. The cards were 
reviewed  and  agreed  in  a  technical  workshop  held  at  the  JRC  in  Ispra  on  18  and  19  November  2013.  The 
workshop brought together Member States, stakeholders and experts, members of the pilots, who contributed in 
several technical working sessions to the further refinement and agreement on the information included in the 
cards.

A fourth step of synthesis is included in the MAES summary tables, which are provided in this report as final 
outcomes of the pilots. The summary tables are built from the outcomes of the MAES cards and synthesized 
information from the MAES matrices. The summary table is seen as the entry point for information regarding 
ecosystem services and potential indicators, proxies and datasets. It combines information provided by Member 
States and EU-level experts alike. The table is designed following the CICES classification and includes a colour 
key classifying indicators into four types (Box 2).

The indicators that are suggested here were each evaluated according to 2 criteria: i) data availability and ii) ability to convey 
information to the policy making and implementation processes (4).

for which harmonised, spatially-explicit data at European scale is available and which is easily understood by policy makers or 
non-technical audiences. Spatially-explicit data in this context refer to data that are at least available at the regional NUTS2 level 
or at a finer spatial resolution. CICES classifies ecosystem services at 4 hierarchical levels. Sometimes, it is more cost-effective to 
consider an assessment of ecosystem services at a higher CICES level than at class level, especially if aggregated indicators are 
available. Indicators that aggregate information at higher hierarchical CICES level can therefore also have a green label.

ecosystem assessment, which possibly results in different interpretations by the user. This is typically the case for indicators that 
are  used  to  measure  ecosystem  condition,  which  are reused  to assess  particular  ecosystem  services.  This  colour  also  includes 
indicators that capture partially the ecosystem service assessed.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

3  MAPPING ECOSYSTEMS 
The assessment of ecosystems and their services needs spatially explicit mapping to address the key drivers (e.g. 
land/sea use and management), pressures (air pollution, climate change etc.) and their different gradients and 
variations in space and time. These are affecting the condition of ecosystems across Europe in all combinations 
of intensities and consequently their biodiversity and the amount of services they can provide. A first version of a 
European ecosystem map has been delivered by EEA and its European Topic Centre for Spatial Information and 
Analysis (ETC/SIA) in December 2013 (Figure 3). For land and freshwater it covers spatially explicit ecosystem 
types  for  EEA-39  countries  at  1  ha  spatial  resolution.  Ecosystems  are  mapped  by  interpreting  available  land 
cover data (Corine LC 2006, 2000) on the basis of the European habitat classification (EUNIS). Such remapping 
(so-called  cross-walk)  allows  for  underpinning  land-cover  information  with  more  detailed  habitat-related 
information to provide more detailed insights into the biodiversity we may expect for each ecosystem type across 
Europe.  

To link habitats with land-cover, additional reference data has been used to specify the areas where habitats are 
present according to their environmental characteristics as described in the EUNIS classes. Land reference data 
include  information  on  elevation,  soil  and  geological  conditions,  and  climate.  Additionally,  potential  natural 
vegetation and phenological data derived from remote sensing (MODIS) have been used to attribute habitats to 
Corine land cover classes. This is particularly useful in being able to distinguish, arable land from grassland.  

The marine part of the map has been developed using global data sets of sea bed conditions, bathymetry, the 
current draft of the national economic zones and sea ice monitoring combined with coastline and coastal areas 
derived from Corine land cover data. 

In situations where additional and/or more detailed information is not available at the national/sub-
national levels, this map or the elements, which have been used to create it (Table 2) can be used as 
input for assessments of ecosystem conditions and ecosystem services.

4  ASSESSING ECOSYSTEM CONDITION  
This  section  provides  three  types  of  information  that  can  be  used  by  Member  States  for  an  assessment  of 
ecosystem condition.  

Firstly, the results of the ecosystem pilots are presented in a summary table showing the essential indicators that 
are available at the scale of Member States to report on the condition of selected ecosystem types. Secondly, this 
chapter contains a summary of a recently finished study, which lists the key datasets that are available at the 
European level for assessment of ecosystem state or condition. Both of these information sources complement 
each other. Thirdly, particular attention goes to the use of Article 17 data for mapping and assessment. Member 
States collect a wealth of information on the conservation status of protected habitats and species, which can 
contribute to the assessment of ecosystem condition. 

4.1  Results from the ecosystem pilots 
Table 3 contains a selection of indicators to measure condition of 10 ecosystems, based on the consultation of 
EU services and MS, which contributed to the ecosystem pilots. Condition indicators discriminate between drivers 
and pressures, and state. Many biodiversity indicators are ecosystem specific whereas others can be used across 
ecosystems. Complete lists are available in the supplement (cf. MAES cards on condition and biodiversity) and on 
CIRCABC12 (cf. MAES matrices with detailed information per input provider). 

The proposed selection of indicators aims to ensure a coherent mapping of ecosystem condition across the EU. 
Variations between countries may arise due to presence of specific ecosystems, pressures, different priorities for 
species protection or spatially explicit patterns of species distribution.  

Table 3 provides a set of cross-ecosystem biodiversity indicators, which can be used for assessments and which 
aim to ensure a consistent approach across the EU. These include at EU level the change in status of protected 
species  (i.e.  Art.17  assessments),  the  assessment  of  extinction  risk  of  threatened  species  (i.e.  EU  Red  List 
assessments) and trends in the abundance and distribution of populations of selected common species (e.g. birds, 
butterflies).  

The assessment of condition can largely build on existing frameworks under the EU Common Agricultural Policy 
(CAP),  the  Water  Framework  Directive  (WFD),  the  Marine  Strategy  Framework  Directive  (MSFD)  and  the  pan-
European  forest  assessment.  Many  green  indicators  are  available  at  national  and  European  scale.  For  most 
marine and freshwater ecosystems, single, aggregated indicators exist (i.e. ecological status and environmental 
status). For wetlands, no final selection was made but possible ways to measure wetland status can be found in 
the MAES cards and matrices. Clearly wetlands (which do not fall under the scope of WFD) are poorly covered 
and would benefit from further work. For agricultural ecosystems, indicators that are being reported under the 
agri-environmental schemes (AEI) or as Common Context Indicators (CCI) to monitor the CAP are proposed. Art.17 
assessments can be used to help assess the state of grassland, less so for cropland. Forest condition indicators 
retained from the pilot studies are mainly measuring state, and data are available at national and EU scale for 
forest pattern, damage and soil condition. Clearly, the list of indicators in Table 3 is not exhaustive and Member 
States are encouraged to integrate additional indicators where these are available.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

4.2  Towards an EU-wide assessment of ecosystems and their 

conditions  

Mapping ecosystems provides information about the spatial extension and distribution of the main ecosystem 
types:  it  is  the  starting  point  for  assessing  the  condition  of  each  ecosystem.  Mapping  ecosystem  condition  is 
useful to deliver additional information about the quantity and quality of services each ecosystem can provide 
taking into account the site specific conditions triggered by climate, geology and other natural factors as well as 
the drivers and pressures it is exposed to. It also affects the functional relationship between ecosystems and 
their  biodiversity.  Changes  in  ecosystem  condition  due  to  human  activities  (harvesting,  management  etc.)  or 
environmental changes such as pollution or climate change provide further information about how their capacity 
to deliver ecosystem services increases or decreases over time. This chapter provides a short overview about the 
Europe-wide information, which is currently available for each ecosystem type to describe condition and change 
over time. The ecosystem types are defined and described in the MAES analytical framework (1). The information 
can be used by Member States and regional stakeholders including the data sets if no more detailed information 
is available. 

ETC/SIA drafted a report entitled Towards a Pan-European Ecosystem Assessment Methodology14 that aims at 
putting together approaches, factual data, ecosystem specific knowledge and tools to assess ecosystems and 
their condition at the European level.  

Table 4 synthesizes the main datasets and indicators that are available. Key drivers and pressures are separated 
into  5  major  classes  (i)  habitat  change,  (ii)  climate  change,  (iii)  land  use  specified  as  overexploitation 
(unsustainable management), (iv) invasive species and (v) pollution and nutrient enrichment. The greenness from 
pale (low) to dark green (high) of each box indicates data availability for European wide assessments.  

The overview aims to be comprehensive with regard to at least terrestrial ecosystems, but coverage is clearly 
limited by the availability of spatial datasets. The overview covers the EEA-3915 countries, which includes the EU-
28.  However,  several  of  the  datasets  that  have  been  included  have  either  wider  or  more  limited  geographic 
extensions. From a European perspective it is obvious that data availability has not reached the same level of 
detail for all ecosystem types and all major drivers and pressures. There is only limited information available for 
heathland and shrubs or wetlands while information for mapping and assessing conditions for forest and agro-
ecosystems  is  much  more  comprehensive.  Data  availability  is  generally  low  also  for  freshwater  and  marine 
ecosystems.  

In terms of ecosystem assessment it is considered more promising to map the current condition of ecosystems 
than reviewing many of the key drivers of change. That is because it is difficult to quantify and assess their 
impact in terms of ecosystem change and their capacity to provide services. This mainly concerns climate change 
and  invasive  species  but  also  goes  for  pollution  and  nutrient  loading  of  freshwater,  wetland  and  marine 
ecosystems. Approaches combining European data sets of ecosystem status with national and regional data are 
likely to provide more detailed insights into the link between ecosystem condition and the provision of ecosystem 
services.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

4.3  The use of Article 17 data for mapping and assessment 
Under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive, Member States must submit information on how the directive is being 
implemented  every  six  years.  For  the  reporting  period  2001  to  2006,  Member  States  provided  detailed 
assessments of the conservation status of each of a  total of 231 habitats (and 1288 species, which are not 
considered here). All national assessments were compiled by the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity 
(ETC/BD) and are available in a geospatial database, which contains information on the range or the presence of 
habitats on a 10 km grid covering the EU-2517. 

4.3.1  The use of data generated in the context of the Habitats18 and Birds Directives19. 
In accordance with the requirements under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive, Member States reported for the 
first time in 2006 on the conservation status of species and habitats covered by the Directive.  The deadline for 
the submission by Member States of the second report under this Directive was June 2013. A consolidated report 
summarizing the information provided in the first reporting round and based on the analysis carried out by the 
EEA20 was published by the European Commission in 200821. The EEA is currently processing and analysing the 
data  provided  by  the  Member  States  under  the  second  reporting  round  and  this  work  is  scheduled  to  be 
completed by early 2015. Member States will, by end-December 2013, also provide for the first time detailed 
reports on the status of European Bird Species to be reported under Article 12 of the Birds Directive. The EEA is 
also expected to complete the processing and analysis of the data contained in these reports by early 2015. 

The  reports  submitted  under  Article  17  of  the  Habitats  Directive  can  make  an  important  contribution  to  the 
mapping and assessment of ecosystems both at the level of the EU and in the Member States. However, it should 
not  be  forgotten  that  the  Directive  was  put  in  place  to protect  the  species  and  habitats  of  European  interest 
considered  to  be  most  at  risk  across  the  European  Union  and  consequently  the  conservation  status  of  these 
species and habitats as reported under Article 17 does not provide a comprehensive overview of the condition of 
the 11 MAES ecosystem types across the 27/28 Member States.  Furthermore, proper account should be taken of 
the way data are generated in the Member States and the way the data are processed and aggregated.  The EEA 
and its associated European Topic Centre on Biodiversity have produced several reports on these issues22. The 
EEA is producing a database on the linkages between the species and habitats covered by the Habitats directive 
and the 11 ecosystem types recognized under the MAES process

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

The Birds Directive covers all the bird species that breed in the EU. There is also evidence from the literature to 
suggest that the status of bird species can provide a robust indicator of ecosystem condition23. The data reported 
under Article 12 of the Birds Directive may therefore provide important insights for the mapping and assessment 
of  ecosystems.  However,  this  is  the  first  time  that  Member  States  have  provided  comprehensive  data  on  the 
status of bird species within the framework of the Birds directive and it will be several months before the data 
can be assessed with regard to their coverage and quality. 

4.3.2  Other global and pan-European sources of information/data in relation to species 

and habitats. 

In addition to the data contained in the reports submitted by Member States in the framework of the Habitats 
and Birds directives, there are other European data sets concerning the abundance and distribution of selected 
species (e.g. birds, butterflies) and species groups including the European Red List assessments24. The recent EEA 
report on Available data for mapping and assessing ecosystems includes a review of these data sources25. 

4.3.3  National, regional and local data sets relating to species, species groups and 

habitats. 

Many of the Member States will have data sets on the status of different species, species groups and habitats. 
Some of these species and habitats will be the same as those covered by the EU legislation but the information 
is likely to be richer than the data reported to the EU. Each Member State will need to decide how to incorporate 
this data into the mapping and assessment of ecosystem condition at the national level. 

One of the key challenges in using current Art. 17 and other information on species and habitats is linking these 
data  to  ecosystem  condition  and  providing  spatially  explicit  maps,  which  are  the  pre-requisite  for  ecosystem 
service assessments. The ecosystem map as outlined in chapter 3 provides a first input data for relating species 
and habitat information based on EUNIS classes to ecosystem condition. Other approaches currently explored are 
mapping Art. 17 species data using the predominant land cover classes of Corine or indicators such as nLEP (net 
Landscape  Ecological  Potential),  which  is  a  composite  of  land  cover  data,  greenness  (a  measure  land  use 
intensity), protection status, and fragmentation. An overview of current approaches and data is provided in the 
ETC/SIA report Towards a Pan-European Ecosystem Assessment Methodology, especially in Annex 1 and 2. In 
the first instance spatially explicit indicators such as nLEP or wilderness provide at least qualitative information 
delineating areas of different levels of expected biodiversity, which can be then underpinned with more detailed 
data on observed species diversity.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

5  ASSESSING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES 
 

This  section  reports  on  the  indicators  that  were  collected  in  the  four  ecosystem  pilots  to  measure  ecosystem 
services at national scale. The results are reported separately for each pilot study but the section ends with a 
common set of lessons learnt and recommendations for assessments.  

5.1  Forest services 
The  summary  table  is  structured  in  three  mains  sections  of  forest  ecosystem  services  (FES)  i.e.  provisioning, 
regulating/maintenance and cultural.  

5.1.1  Provisioning services 
The provisioning section (Table 5) includes those forest services related to forest production of biomass, water 
and energy. In this section there are a reasonably large number of indicators in the green category. Most of these 
services are related to forest biomass supply and several available indicators are derived from data collected by 
National Forest Inventories (NFI) and from the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC) for European level datasets. 
For these services, using data from NFI either as baseline for further assessment and/or mapping OR using it as 
data for model calibration/validation is the recommended option. Therefore, MS should use data from their NFI 
for mapping and assessment of Forest ecosystem services (FES) in this category. Other sources of information 
for  forest  biomass  provision  are  remote  sensing  derived  indicators  that  would  in  any  case  require  ground 
information from NFI for model fitting and validation of results (5). 

Within the provisioning FES the situation regarding water-related services seems more problematic since no plug-
and-play indicators were identified and/or addition of hydrological modelling techniques would be required for 
proper assessments. A few indicators were included for this category, most of them in the red category and only 
modelling-related indicators are green. Regarding provisioning services derived from plants and animals, most of 
the  relevant  indicators  are  in  the  yellow  category,  indicating  a  relatively  good  option  for  mapping  and 
assessment, but requiring further work to be operational.

5.1.2  Regulating/ maintenance services 
This section of FES seems to be poorly covered by available indicators (Table 6) and many of these are coded in 
red.  This  is  the  case  for  Filtration,  sequestration,  storage,  accumulation  by  ecosystems  where  only  two 
indicators were included, one red and one yellow. It is worth mentioning that in this case the area of forest has 
been  suggested  as  one  indicator,  in  red,  for  this  service.  This  is  because  in  this  case  the  area  of  forest  is  a 
qualitative indicator from the perspective that it is able to indicate forested areas, but is unable to account for 
quantitative information about the supply of the service. Consequently the area of forest is considered to be a 
coarse indicator unable to convey relevant information to end-users and policy-makers. Therefore, further refined 
and/or local level assessments should be used for verifying the information provided by this type of indicator. 
This is applicable to other FES indicators coded in red in the summary table.  

Regarding the Division Mediation of flows green indicators are those derived from modelling exercises. In this 
case,  more  robust  information  can  be  provided.  However,  there  is  a  need  for  the  implementation  of  specific 
modelling  approaches  integrating  different  spatial  datasets  usually  in  a  GIS  environment  or  coupled  with 
hydrological models, in particular for erosion protection, water supply and water flow maintenance.  

There is wide variability in the indicators identified in the Division Maintenance of physical, chemical, biological 
conditions.  Four  indicators  are  coded  in  green  representing  the  most  reliable  sources  of  information  for 
assessment and mapping. A closer look shows that for instance abundance of pollinators is an indicator that 
should be streamlined with the agriculture pilot of MAES considering the strong links of these two ecosystems 
regarding  pollinators.  It  is  also  noticeable  that  for  a  number  of  indicators  included  in  the  red  category  more 
accurate local-level assessments could provide more reliable information to end-users and policy makers. One of 
the important services provided by forests regarding global climate regulation is carbon storage (and carbon 
sequestration). Indicators for this service could be computed from available proxy datasets derived from remote 
sensing imagery. Indicators for this service are coded in green and there is good availability of data at European 
and at country level.

5.1.3  Cultural services 
Forest  cultural  services  include  the  non-material  outputs  of  forest  ecosystems.  In  this  report  cultural  services 
should  be  regarded  as  the  physical  settings,  locations  or  situations  that  produce  benefits  in  the  physical, 
intellectual or spiritual state of people. They can involve individual species, forest habitats and whole ecosystems 
(6).  Forest  cultural services are  often  computed  using  multivariable  analysis  techniques  in  a GIS  environment. 
These techniques provide a cost-effective option for integration of a large number of explanatory variables into 
useful,  spatially-explicit  indicators.  Further  refined  analyses  computing  the  economic  value  of  the  recreational 
services  provided  by  forests  are  feasible  using  value-transfer  and  meta-analysis  techniques.  Some  indicators 
included in the summary table (Table 7) are useful baseline data for further GIS-based spatial analysis and/or 
recreational services quantification. Nevertheless, the indicators on their own have a relatively low capacity for 
conveying relevant information to end-users. This is shown in the summary table by the number of indicators 
identified in red. Another important aspect for cultural indicators is the availability and access of readily available 
data on, for instance, number of visitors, data on distribution of wildlife, number of hunters, etc. as well as the 
availability of GIS maps usually needed for computing spatial indicators such as accessibility to forested areas.

5.1.4  Strengths and weaknesses 
In this section we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the indicators included in the forest summary tables 
and propose some options for dealing with data gaps and the handling of red-coloured indicators.  

The set of green indicators in the three tables are those for which information is readily available and that are 
able  to  convey  valuable  information  for  end-users  and  policy-makers.  These  indicators  are  available  at  pan-
European  and  at  country  level  and  are  considered  reliable  sources  of  information  for  the  mapping  and 
assessment of FES. Clearly, the indicators at pan-European level are usually coarser in spatial resolution (grid 
size of around 1 km) in comparison to country-level indicators where finer spatial resolution and higher accuracy 
of the measured variable is expected e.g. forest biomass provision.  

NFI data should play an important role in the assessment and mapping of FES. NFIs are the main sources of 
forest information at country level and of the harmonized data collections held by EFDAC (FISE). Therefore, their 
use  is  the  suggested  option  for  first  hand  data  and  indicators  of  forests  services.  In  some  cases  further 
refinement and analysis should be implemented using NFI data for building indicators of FES, otherwise they can 
be used as baseline data for calibrating and validating models used for implementing FES indicators. 

Among the main limitations of the indicators in the summary table it is necessary to consider the opportunity for 
the proper use of red indicators. In many cases they are qualitative indicators (e.g. forest/non forest maps) and 
are not adequate for allowing an estimation of the supply of services, which should be based on quantitative 
information. The alternative of using qualitative indicators for measuring supply or stock of a given service is a 
limited option for providing information to the policy-makers. Quantitative validated indicators are the suggested 
option for this purpose. This is an aspect that should be carefully considered in the methodological step of the 
implementation of mapping and assessment of FES.

5.2  Cropland and grassland services 
In the pilot on agro-ecosystems two ecosystems were considered: cropland and grassland. The concept of agro-
ecosystems  encompasses  cultivated  crops  (herbaceous  and  woody,  annual  and  perennial),  grasslands,  and 
farmland features as part of farm holdings (hedges, ridges, field margins, buffer strips, uncultivated land, single 
trees, woodlots etc.), composed by natural or semi-natural vegetation.  

The  monitoring  of  environmental  impacts  of  agricultural  practices  has  been  part  of  the  Common  Agricultural 
Policy (CAP) for decades. Monitoring occurs at various scales and resolutions and is harmonised at EU level in:  

 

 

 

 

the Farm Structure Survey (FSS), which is a harmonised agricultural census. Data collected at farm level 
are published at aggregated level by Eurostat; 
the  Farm  Accountancy  Data  Network  (FADN),  which  is  an  instrument  for  evaluating  the  income  of 
agricultural  holdings  and  the  CAP  impacts.  Besides  economic  data  it  contains  physical  and  structural 
data; 
the Land use/cover area frame statistical survey (LUCAS), a survey on the state and the dynamics of 
changes in land use and cover in the EU, which recently has included an extensive topsoil survey; 
the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which is part of the Integrated Administration and Control 
system; besides serving as an identification system for payment entitlements it also contains data at 
parcel level on crop type; 

  Eurostat Agri-environmental indicators (AEIs), that track the integration of environmental concerns into 

 

the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) at EU, national and regional levels; 
the  Common  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Framework  (CMEF)  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  all  rural 
development interventions, and the Common Context Indicators (CCI), which describe the state of the 
economic, social and environmental situation in a given territory at a given time. These are two reference 
frameworks  for  impact  assessment  of  Rural  Development  Plans,  which  include  a  substantial 
environmental part. 

All  these  initiatives  provide  a  wealth  of  information  to  MAES,  in  particular  for  what  concerns  provisioning 
ecosystem  services.  In  some  cases  (i.e.  FSS,  FADN,  LPIS)  they  report  on  the  Utilised  Agricultural  Area  (UAA) 
defined as area used for farming. Common lands are also part of the UAA, while landscape elements such as 
tree  lines  and  woodlots,  though  part  of  farmland,  are  not.  Care  must  be  taken  when  attaching  agricultural 
statistics to land cover maps as the two areal estimates (i.e. UAA and CORINE land cover agricultural classes) 
usually do not match. 

The MAES exercise shows that most of indicators are available either at EU or national scale. It shows as well 
that  it  is not always  possible  to  calculate  separately  ecosystem  service  indicators  for  cropland  and  grassland 
(bounding across ecosystems). This applies to some regulating and to most of the cultural ecosystem services. In 
some  case,  though,  it  is  possible  to  apply  a  cropland  or  a  grassland  mask  a-posteriori  when  the  ecosystem 
service is mapped at a sufficient level of detail (10 km or less) and identify the contribution of each ecosystem 
type. 

On  the  other  hand,  there  are  cases  where  the  same  indicator  can  be  used  to  map  more  ecosystem  services 
(bounding across ecosystem services). This is especially the case of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural lands. 
It can be divided in two broad groups: i) large patches of semi-natural vegetation (i.e. semi-natural grasslands, 

40 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

agroforestry areas, traditional orchards) that are widely recognised as hot spots of agro-biodiversity (so-called 
High Nature Value farmland) and ii) smaller features in more intensive landscapes such as hedgerows, buffer 
strips,  field  margins,  scattered  trees  or  woodlots  (also  referred  to  as  landscape  features).  The  value  for 
biodiversity  and  ecosystem  service  provision  of  the  first  group,  and  especially  of  semi-natural  grasslands,  is 
widely recognised (7). The second group has an important role in providing a number of regulating ecosystem 
services relevant to agricultural production (e.g. pollination, pest control, mitigation of soil erosion) in cropland in 
particular in addition to being widely associated to landscape values and cultural ecosystem services. 

While  the  first  group  can  be  mapped  i.e.  through  LPIS  data  or  the  High  Nature  Value  farmland  indicator  (as 
mapped in the Agri-environmental indicator framework, or reported by Member States in the CMEF), the second 
group is more difficult to map due to the small size of its elements 

5.2.1  Provisioning services 
The  primary  role  of  agriculture  is  to  provide  food,  feed,  fibres,  and  energy.  Therefore,  associating  agricultural 
production to provisioning services is straightforward, as made evident in the MAES table. Data relevant to this 
set  of  services  are  largely  provided  by  CAP  monitoring  and  span  from  parcel  data  (IACS/LPIS)  to  regional 
statistics  (FSS).  The  three  main  divisions  of  provisioning services  (nutrition,  materials,  energy)  can be  mapped 
either through access to detailed parcel data (or derived products i.e. gridded layers) or using regional statistics. 
The units of measure can be surfaces, weight and energy. Once the indicator is selected (area, yield or caloric 
content), it should be maintained throughout the division in order to avoid double counting. For the same reason, 
crops must be allocated either totally or on the basis of known shares to each of the three divisions. If this is not 
possible, divisions should be merged. Energy can be an exception, since the quantity of produced biofuel may in 
fact  be  available  as  an  indicator.  Care  must  be  taken  though,  to  discount  the  corresponding  hectares  of  bio-
energy crops from the other divisions. 

The  proposed  indicators  for  mapping  provisioning  services  (Table  8)  do  not  take  into  account  the  fact  that 
agricultural output is not a mere product of the ecosystems, but a result of land management, and increased 
production figures depend partly on the exploitation of ecosystem services elsewhere (including outside the EU). 
Therefore a full accounting of the agro-ecosystem provisioning services would ideally discount the human input 
(labour, machinery, irrigation, fertilisation, pest control etc.) in order to identify the contribution of ecosystems to 
production.  However,  as  there  is  currently  no  agreed  approach  to  carrying  out  this  discounting  agricultural 
production is retained as indicator as it is widely accepted as a proxy for provisioning ecosystem services from 
agriculture. The link between ecosystems and human systems can be analysed a-posteriori by using the Driver-
Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework (6). 

Livestock  is  considered  as  an  ecosystem  service  as  it  feeds  on  products  of  agro-ecosystems.  For  this  same 
reason, data on livestock should not be used if feed and grassland are already accounted for in the provisioning 
services. In order to avoid double counting, livestock data can be used as indicator when feed and grassland are 
not already included in the cultivated crops indicator. 

Manure  data  can  be  derived  from  excretion  factors  delivered  by  MS  to  Eurostat  for  the  calculation  of  gross 
nutrient balance.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

Water provision is mainly addressed in the table for freshwater ecosystems. In the case of nutrition the role of 
agro-ecosystems in ensuring a good water quality by limiting disservices such as nitrogen and pesticides leaching 
is highlighted.  

Game data are available at the scale of game management units and may include bag estimates (weight) of 
hunted  species.  According  to  habitat  use  of  hunted  species,  data  can  be  extrapolated  for  agro-,  forest  and 
freshwater ecosystems.

5.2.2  Regulating/Maintenance Services 
Agricultural  activities  by  definition  change  the  state  of  ecosystems  and  consequently  have  a  great  impact  on 
regulating/maintenance services. The perspective from which the mapping must be done is of how much agro-
ecosystems  support  regulation  of  ecological  processes  such  as  bio-remediation,  filtration,  mass  stabilisation, 
flood protection, soil formation, and atmospheric composition.  

There is a difficulty in mapping this type of services, partially deriving from the need to map pressures deriving 
from  agriculture  in  order  to  make  it  more  sustainable  (i.e.  soil  erosion,  pollution  by  nitrates  versus  soil  loss 
mitigation  and  nitrogen  removal).  In  the  above-mentioned  monitoring  frames  a  number  of  indicators  are 
available on drivers, pressures and impacts, but these should be used when they are a proxy for an ecosystem 
service  (i.e.  how  much  CO2  is  sequestered  by  agro-ecosystems)  and  not  of  a  disservice  (i.e.  GHG  emissions). 
Drivers, pressures and impacts can be associated to the ecosystem services frame in a post-analysis context to 
explain links and trends (8). 

Exceptionally the measurement of pressures or impacts is accepted as proxy for the ecosystem services: in the 
case  of  soil  erosion  risk,  though  the  percentage  of  soil  covered  though  appropriate  farming  practices  is 
considered a better proxy for this ecosystem service, and in the case of gross nitrogen balance for decomposition 
and fixing processes. 

Overall, the MAES table (Table 9) shows that some indicators are readily available, for example information on 
soil weathering processes is available in the LUCAS topsoil survey, the share of organic farming is available in 
FSS  and  the  AEI  framework,  organic  carbon  content  and  percentage  of  soil  cover  are  available  in  the  AEI 
framework.  LUCAS  topsoil  survey  data  are  collected  through  a  sampling  approach  and,  in  order  to  avoid 
introducing  bias  in  the  estimates, point data  (collected  on  agricultural  lands) should  be  averaged  over  NUTS2 
regions and not at a more detailed resolution. 

As  already  mentioned  above,  a  group  of  ecosystem  services  can  be  mapped  using  as  proxy  the  density  of 
hedgerows or, more generally, woody vegetation in agricultural lands, which is not already tackled by the forest 
pilot (woody landscape features). This is information that is collected at EU level in the LUCAS survey, though it is 
available in this case on a 250 m transect for each point of the sampling grid and may not be sufficient to map 
those ecosystem services that require a full spatial coverage (i.e. pollination). The best option in this case would 
be  to  use  national/regional  surveys  when  available.  LPIS  will  contain  a  reference  layer  to  accommodate  CAP 
Ecological Focus Areas, but this will only become available in 2017. 

National/regional surveys are also needed to report on the pollination ecosystem service, which relies on data on 
pollinators' distribution. As a proxy, the areal coverage of farmland features supporting pollination can be used. 
This is the sum of the macro- and micro- elements of semi-natural vegetation described in the introduction of 
this  chapter  (High  Nature  Value  farmland  including  ecologically  valuable  grasslands,  traditional  orchards, 
traditional  agro-forestry  areas,  plus  small  scale  features  such  as  hedges,  field  margins,  flower  strips  etc.).  A 
pollination potential map is also available at EU scale (9). Such indicators are proxies for landscape suitability to 
host pollinators and to provide pollination as ecosystem service. Pollination is needed for the production of seeds 
both in wild plants and crops. It must be underlined that not all crops need to be pollinated by insects therefore 
the actual service derives from the match between the availability of pollinators and spatial distribution of crops 
depending from insect pollination. Such distribution, though, is not stable over time; therefore a proxy for the 
landscape potential to supply the service is considered sufficient for mapping and assessment purposes.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

5.2.3  Cultural services 
Provision of cultural ecosystem services is deeply rooted in agro-ecosystems, and their thousand-year old history 
of  human  management.  Cultural  manifestations  of  the  link  between  human  society  and  agricultural  land  are 
numerous and very different throughout the EU, therefore the MAES table, especially for intellectual and spiritual 
ecosystem services, cannot be exhaustive. Moreover, due to this variety, and also to some methodological and 
practical difficulties in mapping this type of services EU wide (often surveys are needed), only a few indicators 
are readily available in monitoring frameworks.  

The mapping of physical interaction services is based on indicators describing the experiential use people make 
of  agro-ecosystems.  These  refer  to  visitors/tourism  in  agricultural  areas;  number  of  rural  enterprises  offering 
tourism-related  services);  density  of  walking,  riding,  biking  trails;  number  of  hunting  licences,  number  of 
birdwatchers. Among these, visitors' data are the most appropriate variable to directly map the actual service. 
Most  of  this  information  can  be  available  at  national/regional  level,  except  the  number  of  tourism-related 
enterprises for which there is EU level reporting in the FSS (holdings declaring tourism as other gainful activity). 
Data related to hunting are available at the scale of game management units and may include the number of 
people involved in hunting and hunting related expenditures.  

Intellectual interactions can be mapped through the number of didactic farms, fairs, competitions. The number of 
certified  products  (Protected  Designation  of  Origin,  Protected  Geographical  Identification)  that  require  specific 
(often traditional) landscape management can be used, since on the one hand these products directly represent 
cultural  heritage  linked  to  agro-ecosystems,  and  on  the  other  hand,  their  marketing  supports  agricultural 
landscape maintenance (10). Data on visitors can be used in this context as well, while taking care of avoiding 
double  counting  with  physical  interaction  services.  If  visitor's  preferences  towards  the  use  of  nature  are  not 
known and a share of the overall visitor's number cannot be assigned to the two services, then the mapping 
should be made at a higher aggregation level of the CICES table (i.e. division rather than class). Lastly, with the 
development of social media, the number of photos of agro ecosystems uploaded on websites is becoming an 
option (11).  

Spiritual and emblematic services are probably the most difficult to be mapped; they require local knowledge or 
detailed  mapping  of  landscape  features.  Examples  are  remarkable  trees,  charismatic  species,  pilgrim  paths  in 
rural areas (i.e. Camino de Santiago, Via Francigena).  

Finally, agro ecosystems included in conservation or protection programmes on the basis of their importance for 
the maintenance of biodiversity and other cultural values (e.g. Natura2000, Biosphere reserves, IUCN category V 
areas, World Heritage Unesco sites related to agricultural landscape, landscape conservation areas, High Nature 
Value farmland) can be taken as representative of 'existence' and 'bequest' services in the CICES typology. In this 
case it is important to avoid double counting; the synthesis of the different layers is the product of a spatial 
overlay and not of the sum of areas.

5.3  Freshwater services 
In the pilot on freshwater, four ecosystems were considered: lakes, rivers, groundwater and wetlands26. Table 11 
lists the indicators for mapping ecosystem services provided by these four ecosystems.  

The exercise showed that in some cases the same indicator can be used across different ecosystems (bounding 
across ecosystems). For example, several indicators suggested for wetlands are also used for services provided 
by  forest,  cropland  and  grassland,  as  wetlands  are  at  the  interface  between  water  bodies  and  terrestrial 
ecosystems. In a similar way, many of the indicators proposed for lakes, rivers and groundwater are often of the 
same  typology  (e.g.  ecological  or  chemical  status)  although  in  the  technical  implementation  they  refer  to  the 
specific freshwater ecosystem.  

In other cases the same indicator can be used for different services (bounding across ecosystem services). In this 
case  the  indicator  represents  the  CICES  group  or  division  without  distinguishing  between  different  ecosystem 

                                         
26 The MAES Freshwater pilot dealt with inland surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, small water bodies) and 
groundwater, as well as inland wetlands and floodplains, while transitional waters and coastal waters 
including coastal wetlands were considered in the Marine pilot. 

46 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

service classes. This is especially evident for cultural services where there is overlap in the services at the class 
level  (e.g.  educational  vs.  scientific  services).  For  this  reason,  while  attempts  have  been  made  to  capture  all 
relevant indicators with data at the class level, in some cases indicators were introduced only at the group level. 

The contribution of groundwater to some ecosystem services is not well known as groundwater is connected to 
surface waters and exerts many indirect effects on the functioning of the other ecosystems. This has resulted in 
some  conceptual  difficulties  in  identifying  appropriate  indicators.  Ecosystem  services  related  to  springs  and 
thermal sites can be accounted under rivers and lakes, but those connected to karst systems, such as caves and 
speleology, can be described under groundwater. 

Most  of  the  indicators suggested  for  ecosystem  services provided  by  freshwater refer  to  the  condition  of  the 
water body. This involves the assumption that good conditions indicate a healthier and more resilient ecosystem 
that provides more services and maintains the capacity to provide them for the future. However, the relationship 
between ecosystem conditions and services has not been explicitly explored and remains a topic of research.  

Finally, many indicators are not necessarily the only indicators related to the delivery of a particular service, and 
therefore  they  cannot  be  used  as  a  stand-alone  indicator  for  that  service.  Many  indicators  should  be  used  in 
combination with other datasets or indicators to make them complete or even spatially explicit (see also chapter 
7 and tiered mapping approaches). 

5.3.1  Provisioning Services 
Water provision is the availability of clean water for domestic or industrial use. Water availability (estimated by 
modelling  or  by  simple  difference  between  precipitation  and  evapotranspiration)  conveys  information  on  the 
capacity of the ecosystem to supply water, while water abstraction describes the demand for water. Indicators 
such as the Water Exploitation Index (WEI) (12) combine the supply and demand components. The possibility to 
describe  the  ecosystem  service  at  the  class  level  of  the  CICES  classification  depends  on  the  availability  of 
information  on  the  use,  for  drinking  or  non-drinking  purposes,  and  on  the  source,  from  lakes,  rivers  or 
groundwater (for example, water abstractions reported in Eurostat are divided between water for drinking and 
water for other uses, but the source of the abstractions is not indicated).  Statistical information from datasets 
such as EUROSTAT, needs to be combined with other data such as NUTS, the location of dams or land cover to 
make it spatially explicit. Outputs from models usually contain water availability per river basin or catchment. 

One aspect that is still poorly represented by the annual indicators is the temporal availability of water, as they 
provide  only  the  total  annual  amount  of  water.  In  addition,  when  assessing  water  provisioning  services,  the 
quality  should  also  be  considered.  Higher  quality  is  required  for  drinking  purposes  than  for  other  uses. 
Information on nutrient loading or ecological status of water bodies could provide insights on water quality. 

The provisioning of fish can be described by the fish catch (ton/yr) as in the marine ecosystem. The number of 
licenses  or  fishermen  is  a  proxy  of  the  fishing  activity. In  this  context  the  status  of  a  fish  population  is  an 
indicator  of  the  capacity  of  the  ecosystem  for  fish  provisioning.  Fish  catch  in  tons/yr  could  be  converted  to 
tons/ha/yr. To map the fish provisioning services, the statistics on fish catch could be reallocated to water bodies 
where the fish comes from. For example the total fish catch from a particular administrative region could be 
reallocated to all the water bodies in the region to make it spatial (tier 2 approach to mapping, chapter 7). 

For wetlands the production of wood and reeds for fibres or energy, as well as the production of peat for energy, 
are indicators similar to those used in forest and cropland ecosystems. In the absence of information, the surface 

47 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

of wetlands, peat soils and riparian areas is suggested as proxy for these services. However, only areas within the 
wetland that contain the necessary vegetation cover should be delineated for the service. For example, for wood 
production, only woodland areas or forested areas within the wetland should be mapped. It may be necessary to 
overlay a wetland or riparian zone map with a forest map to map this service. 

5.3.2  Regulating/ Maintenance Services 
Regulating and maintenance services are the benefits humans get from ecosystem through their regulation of 
ecological  processes  such  as  climate  change,  hydrological  cycle  or  sediment  transport.  The  regulation  of 
freshwater ecological processes therefore usually involves many variables including characteristics of vegetation 
surrounding lakes and rivers, soils, slopes and rivers characteristics. The regulation and maintenance services are 
the most difficult to be mapped and assessed, both for the partial understanding of some biophysical processes 
and  for  the  nature  of  the  services,  which  underpin  all  the  other  services.  This  is  especially  evident  for  water 
because the hydrological cycle is at the basis of climate, soil and landscape formation, plant growth, erosion and 
biogeochemical  cycle  of  elements.  The  water  cycle  is  involved  in  almost  all  the  regulation  and  maintenance 
services  and  describing  this  through  few  indicators  is  challenging  and  conceptually  questionable.  The  service 
Hydrological  cycle  and  water  flow  maintenance  is  still  under  discussion  and  it  is  not  possible  to  select  an 
indicator that is better than the others. Many indicators of the water cycle or the modelling of the hydrological 
cycle can be used here.  

The water cycle is also involved in maintaining water quality. Indicators of water quality and the trophic status 
have been suggested as indicators for several regulating services, especially for mediation of waste, toxics and 
other  nuisances  and  for  CICES  group  Water  conditions.  However,  they  are  indicators  of  conditions  and  this 
assumes an implicit relationship between the status of the water body and the provision of the service. Nutrient 
and sediment retention (net amount of nutrient or sediment permanently or temporarily removed by the system 
in  a  time  period)  are  suggested  as  indicators  of  the  ecosystem  service  of  water  quality  regulation.  Usually, 
nutrient  retention  is  estimated  by  modelling,  because  of  the  lack  of  spatial  and  temporal  primary  data.  The 
nutrient load can be considered as a measure of the demand of water purification from nutrient pollution. The 
indicators proposed under mediation of waste, toxics and other nuisances are similar for the different service 
classes, for this reason they are grouped together. 

The  indicator  suggested  for  groundwater  regulation  services  is  generally  the  evolution  of  groundwater  depth. 
Although this is a simple indicator of the status, it can provide insights into the interaction between groundwater 
and surface water as well as surface vegetation and between groundwater and wetlands. The depth of the water 
table has also an influence on the climate.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

5.3.3  Cultural Services 
The most frequent indicator for the cultural services is the number of visitors to the lake, river or wetland. Then 
the specific reason of the visit can describe the service  at a higher level of detail of the CICES classification. 
However, it is often impossible to distinguish between several services, such as entertainment and aesthetic, or 
cultural  and  educational,  and  in  many  case  the  motivation  of  the  visit  is  a  mix  of  several  reasons.  As  the 
information on the number of visitors is often not available, mapping the areas of interest for different cultural 
services can be used as proxy. Examples are: mapping parks, protected areas, bike and walk paths and sacred 
sites in the vicinity of lakes, rivers and wetlands, natural springs and thermal sites, bird watching sites, beaches 
and  contrasting  landscapes.  However,  mapping  contrasting  landscapes,  parks  or  areas  of  interest  shows  the 
capacity to deliver a service, while the number of visitors gives information on the demand for a service. The 
abundance  of  fish  or  waterfowls  indirectly  indicates  the  interest  for  the  area,  assuming  that  the  higher  the 
abundance  the  higher  is  the  interest  or  value;  this  could  be  the  case  for  example for  fishermen  and  hunters. 
Finally, the map of monitoring sites for scientific purposes in lakes, rivers, groundwater and wetlands has been 
suggested as indicator for scientific cultural services. However, this only partially addresses the scientific interest 
for  the  site,  as  monitoring  also  depends  on  the  investment  in  research  and  not  only  on  the  relevance  of  the 
specific site. 

5.4  Marine services 
The typology of marine ecosystems was defined so as to encompass all marine waters, including all waters at 
the  land/sea  interface  with  salinity  higher  than  0.5.  Four  ecosystems  were  considered:  i)  marine  inlets  and 
transitional waters (including, among others, coastal lagoons, estuaries and fjords); ii) coastal waters (up to a 
depth of 70 m); iii) shelf waters (up to a depth of 200 m); and iv) open ocean (depth above 200 m). The decision 
to  test  a  typology  based  mainly  on  bathymetry  (thus  reducing  the  ocean  to  a  2-D  structure  whose  third 
dimension  -pelagic  habitats-  is  attached  directly  to  each  ecosystem)  stemmed  from  the  necessity,  in  this 
preliminary exercise, to: 

 

 

reduce  difficulties  arising  from  data  availability  linked  to  dynamic  ecosystem  boundaries  (based,  for 
example on light penetration or primary production) 
link the mapping and assessment exercise to the reporting streams generated from current legislation in 
various sectors, but mainly:  
  WFD and CAP on the land side 
  MSFD and CFP on the ocean side. 

The  monitoring  of  environmental  impacts  of  human  activities  on  marine  ecosystems,  as  defined  above,  falls 
under the umbrella of a suite of policies, the main and most relevant ones being the WFD, MSFD and the CFP. 
Mapping and assessment of services provided by marine inlets and transitional waters ecosystems can derive 
useful  data  and  indicators  from  the  reporting  framework  of  the  WFD.  The  WFD  covers  not  only  inland  water 
bodies, but also coastal waters within the 1nm from the baseline/coastline in each MS. MSFD explicitly recognises 
the overlaps with WFD and makes it clear that in coastal waters as defined in the WFD, MSFD is only intended to 
apply to those aspects of Good Environmental Status, which are not already covered by WFD (e.g. noise, litter, 
aspects of biodiversity). Thus, coastal waters and, in a limited number of cases, shelf waters ecosystems (as 
defined in the MAES ecosystem typology) may benefit from the joint reporting streams under both directives. 

53 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

Open ocean ecosystems, on the other hand, can take advantage only from data reporting under the MSFD. In 
both instances, data from reporting streams under WFD and MSFD are currently available only at the MS level. At 
the EU level, the identification of indicators for marine ecosystem services has not considered/included WFD nor 
MSFD indicators due to lack of EU harmonised data sets (Table 12). 

Monitoring of fisheries and stock status under the CFP has been ongoing from the 70s. Currently, data collection 
on fisheries is governed by the Data Collection Framework (DCF)27. Under the DCF, Member States are required to 
collect data on biological (e.g. stock assessment) and economic aspects of many European fisheries and related 
fisheries sectors (including the economic situation of the aquaculture and processing industry sectors, and the 
evaluation of the effects of the fishing sector on the marine ecosystem).  

The different pieces of legislation provide a wealth of information relevant to the MAES process, in particular for 
what concerns provisioning services. The MAES exercise shows that most of the indicators are available either at 
EU or national scale. It shows as well that often it is not possible to identify the individual contribution of each 
ecosystem  to  the  provision  of  a  certain  service.  In  those  cases  the  only  realistic  approach  is  to  bundle  the 
assessment of that service across many/all ecosystems (bundling across ecosystems); where and if possible, the 
contribution of each ecosystem can be assessed a-posteriori, using ancillary data at local/regional scale. 

In other cases, the same indicator can be used to map several ecosystem services (bundling across services). The 
scarcity  of  spatially  distributed  data  in  relation  to  marine  ecosystems  means  that  the  same  indicator  can 
sometimes be used to provide information across ecosystems and across services. This is especially the case for 
some  provisioning  and  some  cultural  services.  The  following  paragraphs  provide  guidance  for  the  3  major 
categories of services as presented in the CICES 4 3 classification (Table 12).  

The  CICES  classification  contains  a  number  of  services  that  are  not  relevant  for  marine  ecosystems.  These 
services have decreased font size. Some services for which no indicators are currently available  are considered 
as emerging ones (i.e. they are expected to become relevant sometime in the future) or which are provided at a 
very small/local scale, and therefore too marginal to be included in the national/EU accounting. 

5.4.1  Provisioning services 
Marine  ecosystems  are  major  providers  of  food  and  feed.  Thus,  in  the  provisioning  service  section,  only  the 
divisions related to Nutrition and Materials have been filled out. Energy provision has been considered as not-
applicable for the most part, except for plant-based energy, which has been considered as relevant only at local 
scale.  Within  Nutrition  and  Materials,  Water  provision  with  both  Nutrition  and  Materials  has  not  been 
considered,  as  this  service  is  not  dependent  on  the  biotic  component  of  the  ecosystem.  In  terms  of  food  for 
nutrition and feed (related mostly to provision of fish-meal and the aquaculture industry), indicators proposed are 
available at national and EU level from the Common Fisheries Policy reporting.

5.4.2  Regulating/ maintenance services 
For  the  service  division  on  Mediation  of  waste,  toxic  and  other  nuisances  nutrient  loads  to  coastal  areas  are 
available at EU level through the FATE28 initiative from JRC on pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; 
spatial distribution of total annual deposition fluxes of HM and POP atmospheric input to the regional seas (the 
Baltic, North, Black, Mediterranean and Caspian Seas) is available at EMEP.  

For the service division on Mediation of flows, information is available at EU level as illustrated in Liquete et al. 
(2013) (13).  

For the service division on Maintenance of physical, chemical, biological conditions, some indicators are available 
at national level from reporting requirements under the Habitat directive (e.g. Maintaining nursery populations 
and habitats), and are therefore available at national level, but not harmonized at EU level. Some others are 
resulting from modelling activities and are available within the JRC/EMIS datasets. Chemical conditions of salt 
water is bundled with indicators under the Mediation of waste, toxic and other nuisances division. 

5.4.3  Cultural services 
Only a few services under the Physical and intellectual interactions with biota, ecosystems, and land-/seascapes 
[environmental settings] division have available datasets or proxies harmonized at EU level. Most datasets would 
only be available at local sites, and would not be harmonized even at MS level, thus requiring extensive work to 
extrapolate the datasets in a form relevant for mapping at the national level).  

For  the  Spiritual,  symbolic  and  other  interactions  with  biota,  ecosystems,  and  land-/seascapes  [environmental 
settings] the outlook for available indicators is quite similar.

5.5  Lessons learned  

5.5.1  Similarities and differences between the ecosystem pilots 
Table 13 counts the number of indicators that the pilots delivered in the MAES summary tables on ecosystem 
services. Clearly, lots of indicators are available to use in the assessments. Table 13 reflects to some extent the 
state of knowledge on ecosystems. For forest services, 117 indicators are available, which reflects, in part, the 
importance  of  forests  in  delivering  many  services.  The  freshwater  pilot  collected  114  indicators  but  many 
indicators  have  double  use  as  they  are  relevant  to  two  or  more  of  the  ecosystem  types    rivers,  lakes  and 
wetlands so that the actual number of indicators decreases to 68. Similarly, croplands and grasslands share a 
number of common indicators. The marine pilot delivered 33 indicators for 4 ecosystem types.  

A limited share of the indicators for ecosystem services received a green colour code, corresponding to indicators 
that  are  widely  available  and  ready  to  use  for  reporting  under  Action  5  of  the  EU  Biodiversity  Strategy. 
Importantly,  many  indicators  characterized  as  yellow  or  red  are  available  but  these  indicators  will  require 
additional  expertise  before  they  can  be  used  for  mapping  and  assessment.  Note  also  that  several  marine 
indicators received a green status, which will facilitate the inclusion of marine ecosystems in the assessments.

5.5.2  The use of the MAES typology as classification of ecosystems 
The first MAES paper (1) introduced a typology of ecosystems, which was the basis on which the thematic pilots 
have been selected. Each pilot commented on the applicability of this typology for the specific purpose of this 
study: 

  For forests, the typology worked well and no problems were encountered. It is still important to note 

that the forest ecosystem is defined according to FAO, UNECE and Eurostat definitions. This definition is 
therefore not necessarily consistent with the spatial information on forests in the CLC dataset or in other 
land cover data sets. Consequently, there is not a one-to-one link between the CLC classes (particularly 
Other Wooded Land) and the forest ecosystem. In addition to CLC other sources would be required for a 
proper inclusion of forest ecosystems in an assessment. 
In agricultural assessment the typologies are usually: arable, permanent crops, and grassland. In 
MAES arable land and permanent crops are grouped in one agro-ecosystem. An advantage of this choice 
is that it reduces the complexity of mapping ecosystem services delivered by permanent crops 
separately. However, this category has its own characteristics that are different from those of a 
ploughed field and grasslands, which would justify a separate assessment.  

 

  For freshwater ecosystems, several issues are reported. Mapping freshwater ecosystems and defining 
their boundaries remains challenging. Before assessing ecosystem services, it should be feasible to map 
the ecosystems, which in some cases is not advanced enough to support the development of specific 
indicators, and in any case depends on the scale of the study (regional/local) and the availability of data. 
For example, the delineation of floodplains or riparian areas requires additional work and is hampered 
by data availability. Enhancing the mapping of these specific ecosystems is needed as a first step to 
understand their role and services. None of the pilots actually tested the mapping as such to it can be 
expected that mapping will reveal additional practical problems that need to be addressed later.  

  The marine pilot confirmed earlier observations that the MAES typology has some weaknesses, which 
need  further  discussion.  Contributions  could  possibly  come  from  the  experience  of  MS,  as  they  will 
progress with the national mapping and assessment of marine ecosystems and services. At the EU level, 
the EEA (with its ETC/ICM) is planning to further test this initial proposal as well. 

5.5.3  The use of CICES as classification for ecosystem services 
The  ecosystem  pilots  have  for  the  first  time  tested  the  CICES  classification  to  collect  EU-wide  and  national 
indicators to map and assess ecosystem services. Here we list the most important conclusions with respect to the 
use of the CICES classification for a practically designed assessment of ecosystem services:  

  The  hierarchical  structure  of  CICES  is  very  useful  to  bundle  services  at  class  level  on  condition  that 
indicators  at  higher  level  are  available.  The  hierarchical  structure  proved  to  be  very  useful  for,  in 
particular, the marine ecosystems, which typically lag behind terrestrial and freshwater systems in terms 
of data coverage. Indicators for marine ecosystem services are mostly available at group level. Also for 
the other pilots, several indicators are available at division or group level. The hierarchical structure of 
CICES allows better reuse of indicators that are developed under other frameworks or reporting streams. 
In other words, CICES enables operationalization of ecosystem services and facilitates mainstreaming to 
other policies.  

60 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

  The hierarchical structure of CICES facilitates comparisons of assessments of ecosystem services across 
ecosystems  and  between  the  different  Member  States  and  at  different  scales.  In  this  context,  it  is 
important  that  Belgium  developed  an  expanded  CICES  classification  at  lower  levels  while  ensuring 
comparability at higher level (14). At lower level, the Belgian CICES suits specific national ecosystem(s) 
better and is therefore more meaningful for the country but still allows for coherent reporting to the 
EU29.  

  Applying the CICES classification for marine or freshwater ecosystems is less evident. Many classes are 
not relevant while some classes lead to difficulties in proper interpretation. For freshwater ecosystems 
conceptual difficulties can be encountered when assessing regulation/maintenance services because of 
the nature of the water cycle, which underpins almost all regulation services (in all ecosystems), and the 
lack of knowledge/data for distinguishing between the role of biota and ecosystem in the mediation of 
waste.  In general, interpretations of the classes differ if terrestrial, freshwater or marine systems are 
considered. Importantly, at several entry points in CICES, users referred to other ecosystems as providers 
of  the  service.  This  shows  the  importance  of  developing  an  integrated  approach  across  connected 
ecosystems. 

  There remain conceptual difficulties with ecosystem services delivered by agriculture. Listing explicitly 
cultivated  crops  and  reared  animals  and  their  products  as  ecosystem  services  brings  to  double 
counting according to the SEEA-EEA classification under development (even though the latter is based on 
CICES). Furthermore, proposed indicators do not discriminate between the share of the contribution to 
provisioning services supplied by agro-ecosystems and the role of human energy inputs in contributing 
to total yield.  

  how to deal with imported feedstuff and inputs that lead to the final ecosystem service (crop production, 

reared animals) is not yet clear 

  Some users encountered difficulties in distinguishing between the supply and the demand of ecosystem 
services when reporting indicators under the CICES frame. The concept of ecosystem services exactly 
bridges  the  interface  between  supply  and  demand.  Furthermore,  demand  for  regulating  ecosystem 
services is often difficult to conceptualize. Therefore, it would be useful to develop classifications for 
both  ecosystem  functions  (which  underpin  ecosystem  services)  and  for  ecosystem  benefits  or 
beneficiaries. Such classifications would further allow reusing many more indicators, which are collected 
at EU or MS level for mapping and assessment of ecosystem services. 

  CICES contains some groups that pose problems to users, in particular water conditions and mediation 
by biota. Under the MAES framework, condition is referred to as a state of the ecosystem while bio-
remediation  was  interpreted  by  several  as  a  technique  to  solve  a  pollution  problem.  Mediation  by 
ecosystems  seems  better  accepted  as  ecosystem  service  and  all  pilot  contributors  have  put  their 
indicators under this class.  

 

 

                                         
29 The CICES classification also links to other classification systems such as the MA, TEEB or UK-NEA 
classifications. A CICES translator is available here: http://openness.hugin.com/example/cices

summary tables, some key recommendations for a cost-effective national assessment of ecosystem services are 
drawn: 

  Go green! Green ecosystem services indicators are available off-the-shelf at national or EU scale. They 
are collected by different organisations in Member States to report on various EU and national policies. 
Indicators for ecosystem services delivered by agro-ecosystems are to a wide extent covered by data 
sets  and  monitoring  schemes  that  report  under  the  Common  Agriculture  Policy.  Indicators  for  forest 
services, depend to a large extent on national forest inventories. Indicators for water are available in 
national  statistical  offices  or  depend  on  data  collected  under  the  Water  Framework  and  Floods 
directives. Green indicators are available for immediate application (see Table 14) 

  Prioritize! Whereas most ecosystem services are delivered by many ecosystems, particular ecosystems 
clearly produce more of certain services than other ecosystems. This knowledge helps prioritize mapping 
and assessment efforts of Member States (see Table 14). In addition, certain ecosystem services, but in 
particular  most  cultural  ecosystem  services,  are  shared  by  many  ecosystems.  It  avoids  double  work 
when  mapping  and  assessment  of  these  services  is  done  in  a  single,  horizontal  way  across  all 
ecosystems.  

  Avoid double counting! Dont use the same indicator more than once as a proxy for an ecosystem 
service. Rather use the hierarchical structure of CICES to aggregate ecosystem services to a higher level 
for which suitable indicators may be available.  

Table  14  provides  a  summary  of  green  and  yellow  indicators  based  on  the  information  provided  by  MAES 
summary  tables  of  the  4  pilot  ecosystems.  Where  relevant,  it  assigns  to  each  ecosystem  service  a  leading 
ecosystem i.e. an ecosystem, which is a major provider of a particular ecosystem service. For example, forests 
are principal providers of wild food products, biomass for materials and energy, or climate regulation. Equally, 
agro-ecosystems  provide  food  and  biomass  and  several  regulating  services  that  are  connected  to  food 
production. Freshwater systems are crucially important in all water services. Marine ecosystems are considered 
separately. Mapping and assessing ecosystem services using the indicators listed in Table 14 would result in a 
first, inclusive ecosystem assessment at MS scale. In depth assessments per ecosystem type, however, require a 
more  detailed  approach  and  the  use  of  indicators  listed  in  the  ecosystem  specific  MAES  cards  and  summary 
tables.

6  NATURAL CAPITAL ACCOUNTING 

The  development  of  a  methodological  approach  for  Natural  Capital  Accounting  (NCA)  is  the  focus  of  pilot  study  6 
under the MAES process (see section 2.2). The objective of this pilot study is to address the second part under Target 
2, Action 5 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 (see underlined text): 

Member States, with the assistance of the Commission, will map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services 
in their national territory by 2014, assess the economic value of such services, and promote the integration of these 
values into accounting and reporting systems at EU and national level by 2020. 

While 2020 is still some time away the conceptual and operational foundations have to be laid now for the above 
targets to be achievable. This requires a step-by-step approach, which needs to begin with defining key concepts and 
the building of the bio-physical foundation for subsequent valuation steps. Work under the NCA pilot therefore focused 
on defining the concept of natural capital as well as describing and developing suitable accounting approaches with 
regard to the state of ecosystems and their services.  

In  the  context  of  the  EU  2020  Biodiversity  Strategy  the  pilot  study  on  Natural  Capital  Accounting  focuses  on  the 
ecosystem component of natural capital rather than on geo-physical assets. This provides a direct link to the mapping 
and assessment of the state of ecosystems and their services. Data compiled under this process will be an important 
input  to  the  further  development  of  ecosystem  (capital)  accounts;  on  the  other  hand  accounting  approaches  can 
provide a very useful framework for structuring ecosystem-related data and integrated analysis (see chapter 2 for the 
importance of a coherent approach across ecosystems) .  

Accounting systems only function if they build on clearly categorised, well-structured and comprehensive input data 
sets. The interest in ecosystem accounting has therefore driven the development of CICES, the Common International 
Classification  of  Ecosystem  Services  (see  www.cices.eu),  which  is  the  approach  recommended  under  MAES  for 
classifying  ecosystem  services  and  discussed  in  section  5.5.2.  Other  aspects  of  data  that  are  important  for  their 
analytical value are sufficiently detailed spatial referencing and comparability across space and time. Ensuring these 
two  dimensions  is  a  challenging  task  for  ecosystem-related  data  sets.    The  reference  document  on  natural  capital 
accounting  (currently  under  consultation)  provides  information  on  key  methodological  considerations  in  this  regard, 
building inter alia on experience in developing simplified ecosystem capital accounts at EEA.  

If  set  up  correctly,  ecosystem  capital  accounting  also  provides  a  useful  unifying  frame  for  tackling  integrated 
analytical  questions.  For  example,  water  accounts,  carbon  accounts  and  land  accounts,  and  the  underlying  data, 
provide  relevant  information  for  key  pressures  on  ecosystems  and  biodiversity,  such  as  fragmentation  and 
degradation. Similarly, the interface between water and land accounts, as well as the use of indicators on accessible 
water, can help identify areas or ecosystems at risk of water stress. Linked with other accounts or data sets such a 
system can help to analyse which are the most important pressures (linked to sectoral drivers) that influence state 
and trends in ecosystem condition.  

With  appropriate  scientific  and  methodological  guidance,  data  gathered  to  compose  different  kind  of  accounts 
included in ecosystem capital accounting can support biodiversity policies by collecting information on the pressures 
on ecosystems. This can help inform policies to reduce pressures, help biodiversity proofing policies and programmes 
and facilitate the integration of biodiversity into other policies (e.g. agriculture or cohesion policy). 

64 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

Finally, it should be noted that ecosystems provide benefits to people, society and the economy through the provision 
of  ecosystem  services    hence  the  use  of  the  natural  capital  concept.  However,  nature  also  has  an  intrinsic  value 
beyond its utility to mankind. Both types of values are important to be recognised and reflected in decision making. 
The wider values of nature were recognised in the recent Rio+20 outcome document, which reaffirms  the intrinsic 
value  of  biological  diversity,  as  well as  the  ecological,  genetic,  social,  econ omic,  scientific,  educational,  cultural, 
recreational  and  aesthetic  values  of  biological  diversity  and  its  critical  role  in  maintaining  ecosystems  that  provide 
essential services, which are critical foundations for sustainable development and human well-being (para 197 UNCSD 
2012). 

This means our relationship with nature and its role in decision-making processes should not be reduced to the 
economic and other benefits it provides. An ethical concern for the value of nature in its own right needs to 
continue to inform public and private decision-making.

presentations and outcome of a workshop on NCA in June 2013 is available

7  TOWARDS INTEGRATED MAPPING AND ASSESSMENT 

7.1  Linking biodiversity and ecosystem condition to human well-being 
One of the essential objectives of Action 5 and of the MAES conceptual framework is to support an analysis that 
looks at the benefits of preserving biodiversity and maintaining or bringing ecosystems into a healthy condition 
for  human  well-being.  Target  2  of  the  EU  biodiversity  strategy  to  2020  is  indeed  built  on  the  premise  that 
healthy ecosystems, rich in biodiversity, deliver more and multiple ecosystem services than ecosystems, which 
are degraded or exploited for maximizing the delivery of single or few services. Whereas this paper cannot dwell 
on the exact nature of the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem condition and ecosystem services (see 
Table  15),  it  does  develop  part  of  the  evidence  base  that  can  be  used  to  help  provide  such  an  in-depth 
assessment. In particular, it explains how to demonstrate the diversity of ecosystem condition and ecosystem 
services across a large range of environmental conditions (15).  

A very practical example to perform an assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services at national scale is 
available for Spain30 (6). This document can be used as a state of the art example on how information, which is 
provided in this report, can be brought together in a single national ecosystem assessment, which unravels the 
links between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being. 

The FP7 project BESAFE, funded by DG RTD is currently finalizing a systematic review of the relationship between 
biodiversity, ecosystem services and value. These results will become available to the working group during 2014.  

Under  the  new  Horizon  2020  program  the  Commission  will  fund  dedicated  research  work  on  the  relationship 
between biodiversity and ecosystem services.

7.2  A tiered approach to mapping and assessing ecosystem services 
An  analysis  of  the  MESEU  project  country  cases31  and  the  information  provided  in  this  paper  suggests  the 
following tiered process in order to make ecosystem services maps comparable across Europe and to support the 
Member  States  in  mapping  ecosystem  services.  The  level  of  detail  of  input  data  and  the  complexity  of  the 
analysis  increase  from  Tier  1  to  Tier  3  as  illustrated  here  (see  Figure  4)  for  the  production  of  wild  berries  in 
forests,  an  important  provisioning  service,  which  has  also  relevance  as  cultural  service.  The  mapping  work  as 
such requires expertise in GIS. The choice for an approach depends on available data and resources.  

7.2.1  Tier 1  Ecosystem service mapping using available indicators  
The simplest form of an ecosystem services assessment uses data available for most of the European countries 
(for example CORINE). Most indicators can directly be derived from land use and land-cover data, biodiversity 
monitoring  maps,  national  forest  inventories,  etc.  and  thus  represent  proxies  for  a  certain  ecosystem  service. 
Many indicators in the MAES summary tables are area-based indicators or are spatially-explicit and can thus be 
used for direct mapping.  

7.2.2  Tier 2  Ecosystem services mapping linking different indicators with land use data  
The Tier 1 approach can be further improved if data at MS or EU level are used as a base to derive more complex 
indicators,  which  are  combined  to  estimate  ecosystem  services.  Land  use  data  is  linked  to  different  datasets 
according  to  known  relationships  between  land  use  and  ecosystem  services  provision  and  supplemented  with 
local/regional/national  data.  Based  on  these  relationships,  the  capacities  of  different  land  use  to  provide 
ecosystem services can be quantified at different locations and aggregated at different scales. For example, in 
order to estimate wild berry production, literature data or expert based scores on berry production can be linked 
to  different  forest  types  and  mapped  at  the  country  scale  (up-scaling).  Likewise,  national  production  of 
consumption statistics of wild berries, if available, can be downscaled using the area of different forest types as 
a  spatial  surrogate  to  obtain  a  map  of  wild  berry  production.  Many  of  the  indicators  reported  in  the  MAES 
summary cards can in this way be combined with the maps of ecosystems to obtain an up-scaled or down-scaled 
map of a certain ecosystem services. This procedure requires basic GIS skills (cf. QuickScan)32.  

7.2.3  Tier 3 - Model-based approaches to map ecosystem services  
The  Tier  2  approach  can  be  further  refined  by  modelling  biophysical  processes  in  a  GIS  or  in  other  software 
instead of linking indicator data through simple relationships. For example, berry production may be assessed by 
modelling the spatial distribution of wild berry species using climate data as well as other environmental data 
relevant to the distribution of plant species. In a second step, process based data can be used to assess annual 
production and in combination with forest types, the result is a spatially resolved model on wild berry production. 
Constructing a model is time consuming and requires expert knowledge on modelling. Adjusting an existing model 
to local conditions on the other hand is much easier. Models can be extended by integrating expert knowledge 
(for example using Bayesian networks), and can be used to assess uncertainty in quantification and valuation. 
Several  tools  for  tier  3  based  mapping  and  assessment  of  ecosystem  services  are  available  and  can  be 
downloaded or consulted free of cost (e.g InVEST, or ARIES). 

                                         
31 The tiered mapping approach is proposed by Adrienne Gret-Regamey, Bettina Weibel and Sven-Erik 
Rabe (Planning of Landscape and Urban Systems, ETH Zurich).

Box 3. Regression modelling and prediction of bilberry cover based on NFI data on bilberry cover and on explanatory 
variables on climate and forest conditions. 

Sweden develops a set of regression models to map ecosystem services. One example is bilberry cover, which is recorded on the field 
plots of the National Forest Inventory. These field data were modelled as a function of nationally mapped variables on topography, 
soil moisture, climate and forest conditions, which have been estimated using modelling or remote sensing. Subsequently, the model 
was applied to predict the national spatial distribution of bilberry. In a second step, process based data can be used to assess annual 
production and in combination with forest types. The result is a spatially resolved model on wild berry production.

7.3  The Ecosystem Services Partnership Visualization tool: an 

interactive knowledge platform for ecosystem service maps 

Assessing, quantifying, mapping and modelling ecosystem services is becoming more and more urgent due to 
their recognition as essential for population maintenance both by the scientific community and the policy makers 
not only at EU level, but also globally. As described above, there is a great variety in methods and models used to 
map  and  quantify  ecosystem  services,  classification  systems  and  terminologies  (26,  27).  Within  the  Member 
States  ecosystem  services  indicators  and  mapping  methods  used  might  vary,  however,  a  consistency  in  them 
allows  for  comparability  of  the  outputs  (see  7.2).  Given  this,  the  mapping  and  modelling  thematic  working 
groups  (TWG)  of  the  Ecosystem  Services  Partnership  (ESP)  have  jointly  developed  a  blueprint  for  mapping 
ecosystem services (Crossman et al., 2013). The blueprint systematically organizes all types of information that 
need to be taken into account for ecosystem services mapping and modelling, serving both as a checklist and as 
a structure to be followed for putting all the available information together. Using this structure and with the 
support of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC) the ESP is developing a web platform 
that  gathers  maps  and  information  on  ecosystem  service  assessments,  organizes  it  in  a  systematic  way  and 
makes  it  available  for  data  sharing  among  ES  practitioners.  This  system  is  currently  available  under  esp-
mapping.net (Figure 5).

The  goal  of  this  system  is  to  serve  as  a  repository  for  maps  of  ecosystem  services,  go  beyond  simple 
visualization, provide metadata for the available maps and give users the option to download this information. 
The  tool  also  allows  the  users  to  upload  ecosystem  service  maps,  making  them  available  for  sharing  and 
allowing for an open dialogue within the ecosystem services community. Specifically, the tools consists of:  

  An  ecosystem  services  map  documentation  database.  The  database  consists  of  multiple  attributes  
following the blueprint structure (28) - interlinked with many-to-many relationships. The records of the 
database are published online either by the system administrators or registered users.  

  A map viewer. The users can query the database and view the returned results given that the tool allows 
for:  a)  Querying  the  database,  b)  Map  visualization,  navigation  and  download  and  c)  Map  and  data 
upload.  For  each  of  the  uploaded  maps  the  users  also  declare  the  level  of  completion  of  each  map, 
allowing other users to comment on the existing data and thus promoting an open dialogue among the 
ecosystem  services  practitioners.  Users  can  also  overlay  ecosystem  services  maps  with  some  base 
layers  like  maps  of  ecosystems,  ecoregions,  protected  areas  or  other  types  of  layers.  A  detailed 
description of the already available background layers is provided in the tool technical guide (Drakou et 
al. under review).

8  CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS  
 

The work undertaken by the MAES Pilots in 2013 shows that there is a big potential for using data that already 
exist and combining these data into a coherent and integrated ecosystem assessment. This report presents an 
extensive list of indicators, which can be used, together with a typology and map of ecosystems, to make a first 
assessment of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services. The pilot studies have shown that several policies 
including  agriculture,  water,  marine,  forest  and  nature  policies,  already  contribute  data  and  indicators  for 
ecosystem  assessments  under  Action  5.  This  would  thus  facilitate  the  mainstreaming  of  biodiversity  and 
ecosystem services, which is embedded in EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. 

At  the same  time,  the  MAES  pilot studies  highlighted  several  issues that  remain  to  be  resolved  in  the  future. 
Arguably, this report is the best possible compromise between providing working guidance to the Member States 
to deliver under Action 5 and a finished guidance document that includes detailed instructions to map and assess 
all MAES ecosystem types and their services at CICES class level.  

Clearly, the activities around Action 5 will require continuous improvement on the road towards 2020:  

 

In general, the link between science and policy should be strengthened and more support provided to 
policy-relevant research. 

  Data sharing capabilities need to be enhanced in Europe and in particular, data coming from long-term 

ecological research sites (cf. LTER) and research.  

  The  links  between  biodiversity  and  the  delivery  of  ecosystem  services  warrant  further  research  and 
evidence  gathering.  Whereas  to  some  extent,  there  remains  scientific  uncertainty  about  the  exact 
relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services, a better availability 
and  usability  of  biodiversity  datasets  will  provide  new  insights  and  will  boost  the  mapping  and 
assessment  of  ecosystem  services,  in  particular  of  cultural  services  that  are  strongly  connected  to 
biodiversity (bird watching, mapping of emblematic species). 

  Continuous  efforts  should  go  as  well  to  a  better  integration  of  Article  17  assessment  data  for  the 
purposes of mapping and assessing ecosystems and their services. This activity will become even more 
important  when  the  second  round  of  assessments  is  finished  and  when  these  data  will  become 
available.  

  Several conceptual issues remain unresolved and require dedicated action. Some important issues under 
discussion are the typology of marine and some freshwater ecosystems such as floodplains and the role 
of agro-ecosystems in delivering provisioning ecosystem services in relation to energy inputs that are 
required to harvest agricultural products. 

  Further guidance is needed on upscaling or downscaling data and indicators for condition and services to 

the desired spatial unit of assessment or reporting. 

  There is a need for capacity-building in all Member States in order to create a community of practice in 
Europe that will contribute to improve the knowledge and evidence for EU environment policy in line with 

72 | P a g e  

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

Priority Objective 5 of the General Union Environment Action Programme to 2020 'living well, within the 
limits of our planet'.33 

In  response  to  these  challenges,  the  EU  is  committed  to  provide  tools  that  would  facilitate  the  exchange  of 
information  and  expertise  across  levels  (cf.  Ecosystem  Services  Platform).  Information  services  such  as  the 
Biodiversity Information System for Europe (BISE), the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE), the Water 
Information System for Europe (WISE) and the European climate adaptation platform (CLIMATE-ADAPT) are being 
developed to facilitate the access and understanding of EU relevant environmental information to a wide public. 

Importantly,  the  new  research  program  Horizon  2020  will  promote  the  open  access  to  data  initiative.  The 
possibility  for  transferring  policy-relevant  data  and  metadata  to  the  European  Environmental  Data  Centres  is 
being explored34. Dedicated research on biodiversity and ecosystem services is announced in the working program 
and specific support will go to enhancing the mapping of ecosystems and their services.  

The MESEU project will continue delivering targeted guidance to Member States for mapping and assessment. 

Finally, we encourage Member States and stakeholders to submit comments to this report in order to help the 
working group MAES in delivering better targeted and more complete guidance for mapping and assessment.

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

ANNEX 1: GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
Assessment: The analysis and review of information derived from research for the purpose of helping someone in a 
position  of  responsibility  to  evaluate  possible  actions  or  think  about  a  problem.  Assessment  means  assembling, 
summarising, organising, interpreting, and possibly reconciling pieces of existing knowledge and communicating them 
so that they are relevant and helpful to an intelligent but inexpert decision-maker (Parson, 1995). 

Assets: Economic resources (TEEB, 2010). 

Benefits: Positive change in wellbeing from the fulfilment of needs and wants (TEEB, 2010). 

Biodiversity: The variability among living organisms from all sources, including inter alia terrestrial, marine, and other 
aquatic  ecosystems  and  the  ecological  complexes  of  which  they  are  part,  this  includes  diversity  within  species, 
between species, and of ecosystems (cf. Article 2 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992).  
Biophysical structure: The architecture of an ecosystem as a result of the interaction between the abiotic, physical 
environment and the biotic communities, in particular vegetation.  

Biophysical  valuation:  A  method  that  derives  values  from  measurements  of  the  physical  costs  (e.g.,  surface 
requirements, labour, biophysical processes, material inputs). 
Conservation status (of a natural habitat): The sum of the influences acting on a natural habitat and its typical 
species that may affect its long-term natural distribution, structure and functions as well as the long-term survival of 
its typical species (EEC, 1992). 
Conservation status (of a species): The sum of the influences acting on the species concerned that may affect the 
long-term distribution and abundance of its populations (EEC, 1992). 

Drivers of change: Any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. 
A direct driver of change unequivocally influences ecosystem processes and can therefore be identified and measured 
to differing degrees of accuracy; an indirect driver of change operates by altering the level or rate of change of one or 
more direct drivers (MA, 2005). 
Ecological value: Non-monetary assessment of ecosystem integrity, health, or resilience, all of which are important 
indicators to determine critical thresholds and minimum requirements for ecosystem service provision (TEEB, 2010). 

Economic valuation: The process of expressing a value for a particular good or service in a certain context (e.g., of 
decision-making) in monetary terms (TEEB, 2010). 
Ecosystem: A dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities and their non-living environment 
interacting as a functional unit (MA, 2005). For practical purposes it is important to define the spatial dimensions of 
concern. 

Ecosystem assessment: A social process through which the findings of science concerning the causes of ecosystem 
change, their consequences for human well-being, and management and policy options are brought to bear on the 
needs of decision-makers (UK NEA, 2011). 

Ecosystem condition: The capacity of an ecosystem to yield services, relative to its potential capacity (MA, 2005). 
For the purpose of MAES, ecosystem condition is, however, usually used as a synonym for 'ecosystem state'. 

Ecosystem degradation: A persistent reduction in the capacity to provide ecosystem services (MA, 2005).

Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services 

Ecosystem function: Subset of the interactions between biophysical structures, biodiversity and ecosystem processes 
that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide ecosystem services (TEEB, 2010).  
Ecosystem  process:  Any  change  or  reaction,  which  occurs  within  ecosystems,  physical,  chemical  or  biological. 
Ecosystem  processes  include  decomposition,  production,  nutrient  cycling,  and  fluxes  of  nutrients  and  energy  (MA, 
2005). 
Ecosystem  service:  The  benefits  that  people  obtain  from  ecosystems  (MA,  2005).  The  direct  and  indirect 
contributions  of  ecosystems  to  human  well-being  (TEEB,  2010).  The  concept  'ecosystem  goods  and  services'  is 
synonymous  with  ecosystem  services.  The  service  flow  in  MAES  conceptual  framework  refers  to  the  actually  used 
service. 

Ecosystem state: The physical, chemical and biological condition of an ecosystem at a particular point in time which 
can also be referred to as its quality. 
Ecosystem status: An ecosystem state defined among several well-defined categories including its legal status. It is 
usually  measured  against  time  and  compared  to  an  agreed  target  in  EU  environmental  directives  (e.g.  Habitats 
Directive, Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive), e.g. conservation status. 
Energy  inputs:  Subsidies  added  to  ecosystems  such  as  fertilizers,  fossil  fuel,  or  labour  that  are  required  to  turn 
ecosystem functions into ecosystem services and benefits.  

Functional traits: A feature of an organism that has demonstrable links to the organisms function. 

Habitat: The physical location or type of environment in which an organism or biological population lives or occurs. 
Terrestrial or aquatic areas distinguished by geographic, abiotic and biotic features, whether entirely natural or semi-
natural. 

Human well-being: A context- and situation dependent state, comprising basic material for a good life, freedom and 
choice, health and bodily well-being, good social relations, security, peace of mind, and spiritual experience (MA, 2005). 
Indicator: Observed value representative of a phenomenon to study. In general, indicators quantify information by 
aggregating different and multiple data. The resulting information is therefore synthesised. 

Socio-economic  system:  Our  society  (which  includes  institutions  that  manage  ecosystems,  users  that  use  their 
services and stakeholders that influence ecosystems) 

Value: The contribution of an action or object to user-specified goals, objectives, or conditions (MA, 2005).
