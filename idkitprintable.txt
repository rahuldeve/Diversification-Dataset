Florida's 

Identity Theft 

Victim Kit 

 
A guide for victims of identity 

theft, detailing what to do 

and who to contact. 

 
 

 

 

 
 
 
This kit is designed to help you work through the process of resolving your identity theft 
case  and  clearing  your  name.  While  there  are  many  general  identity  theft  resource 
guides available, this kit was specifically developed to provide assistance to Floridians 
who  are  identity  theft  victims,  as  well  as  individuals  in  other  states  who  had  their 
personal information fraudulently used in the state of Florida.  
 
Navigating through the system as an identity theft victim can be a lengthy and confusing 
process.  As  you  contact  law  enforcement,  creditors,  and  financial  institutions,  it  is 
important  that  you  keep  track  of  the  actions  you  take  and  retain  a  record  of  your 
progress.  
 
When  your  identity  is  stolen  your  personal  identifiers  can  be  misused  in  a  variety  of 
different ways. As soon as you become aware that your information has been misused, 
there are several basic steps you should take that apply to nearly all kinds of identity 
theft cases: 
 
 
Step One 
 
Report the incident to the fraud department of the three major credit bureaus. 
 

  Ask the credit bureaus to place a "fraud alert" on your credit report. 

  Order  copies  of  your  credit  reports  so  you  can  review  them  to  see  if  any 
additional  fraudulent  accounts  have  been  opened  in  your  name  or  if  any 
unauthorized charges have been made to other accounts. 

  Request a victim's statement that asks creditors to contact you prior to opening 

new accounts or making changes to any existing accounts. 

 
Contact information for the three major credit bureaus is as follows:

Step Two 
 
Contact the fraud department of each of your creditors.  
 

  Gather  the  contact  information  for  each  of  your  credit  accounts  (credit  cards, 

utilities, cable bills, etc.) and call the fraud department for each creditor.  

 

 

 

 

  Report the incident to each creditor, even if your account at that institution has 
not  been  tampered  with.  Close  the  accounts  that  you  believe  have  been 
compromised.  Ask  the  credit  bureaus  to  place  an  "alert"  on  any  accounts  that 
remain open. 

  Follow-up  in  writing  immediately.  The  Federal  Trade  Commission  provides  an 
Identity  Theft  Affidavit  (attached),  a  standardized  form  used  to  report  new 
accounts  fraudulently  opened  in  your  name.  Check  with  the  company  to  see  if 
they accept this form. If not, request that they send you their fraud dispute form. 

  Confirm all conversations in writing. Follow behind your phone call with a letter 

and any necessary documentation to support your claim.  

2 

  Call the Federal Trade Commission at 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338) and request a 
copy of their brochure "Identity Crime:  When Bad Things Happen to Your Good 
Name." This brochure contains sample dispute letters to help get you started as 
well  as  more  information  on  resolving  credit  problems.    The  brochure  is  also 
available through the Federal Trade Commission website at www.ftc.gov 

 
 
Step Three 
 
Contact your bank or financial institution. 
 

 

If your checks have been stolen, or if you believe they have been used, contact 
your bank or credit union and stop payment right away. 

  Put stop payments on any outstanding checks that you are unsure about. 

  Contact the major check verification companies and request they notify retailers 

who use their databases not to accept your checks: 
 
TeleCheck 1-800-710-9898 or 927-0188  
Cetergy, Inc 1-800-437-5120  
International Check Services 1-800-631-9656  

  Call SCAN at 1-800-262-7771 to learn if bad checks have been passed in your 

name.  

 

If you suspect your accounts have been compromised, cancel your checking and 
savings accounts and obtain new account numbers.  

 
 
Step Four 
 
Report the incident to law enforcement. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  Contact  your  local  police  department  or  sheriffs  office  to  file  a  report.  Under 
Florida  Statute  817.568,  the  report  may  be  filed  in  the  location  in  which  the 
offense occurred, or, the city or county in which you reside.  

  When you file the report, provide as much documentation as possible, including 
copies  of  debt  collection  letters,  credit  reports,  and  your  notarized  ID  Theft 
Affidavit. 

  Request a copy of the police report. Some creditors will request to see the report 

to remove the debts created by the identity thief.

What Else Can I Do? 
 
File a complaint with the FTC's Identity Theft Clearinghouse 

The Clearinghouse is the federal government's repository for ID theft complaints. 
Complaint information is entered into a central database, the Consumer Sentinel, 
which is accessed by many local and state law enforcement agencies in Florida, 
as well as Florida's Attorney General, for identity theft investigation. Call the toll-
free hotline at 1-877-IDTHEFT. 

 
 
Flag your Florida Driver's License. 

At  your  request,  the  Fraud  Section  of  the  Department  of  Highway  Safety  and 
Motor  Vehicles  (DHSMV)  will  place  a  flag  on  your  driver's  license  if  you  are  a 
victim  of  identity  theft  (regardless  of  whether  your  Florida  Driver's  License  has 
been compromised). To reach the Fraud Section, call (850) 617-2405. You will 
be asked to submit your request in writing to: 
 
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles 
DDL/BDI - Fraud Section, Room A327 
Neil Kirkman Building 
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0570 

If you believe that the identity thief has actually used your personal information to 
secure  a  Florida  Driver's  License  or  Identification  Card,  DSHMV  will  conduct  a 
fraud investigation. To initiate this investigation, request a DHSMV Identity Theft 
Report Form and mail it to the address above.  The form is also available through 
the DHSMV website at www.hsmv.state.fl.us 

 

 
 
Get assistance through Florida's Fraud Hotline.  

Florida's Attorney General provides a toll-free fraud hotline for Floridians who are 
the victims of Fraud. Contact the hotline at 1-866-9-NO-SCAM (1-866-966-7226). 
Trained advocates can help provide additional resource information in your area. 

 
 
Check your Florida criminal history information. 

In some instances of identity theft, a victim may be faced with a criminal record 
for  a  crime  he  or  she  did  not  commit.  The  Florida  Department  of  Law 
Enforcement  (FDLE)  can  provide  a  Compromised  Identity  Review  (based  on  a 
fingerprint  comparison  of  state  criminal  history  files)  to  determine  what,  if  any, 
criminal  history  belongs  to  you,  and  if  any  arrest  records  have  been  falsely 
associated  with  you  as  a  result  of  someone  using  your  identity.  If  a  fingerprint 
check determines you are an identity theft victim, FDLE will work with local law 
enforcement agencies to attempt to clear fraudulent data from the criminal history 
files  and  provide  you  with  a  Compromised  Identity  Certificate.    For  more 
information,  contact  FDLE's  Quality  Control  Section  at  (850)  410-8880  or  visit 
www.fdle.state.fl.us

Contact the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. 

After  you  have  filed  a  report  with  local  law  enforcement  and  with  the  FTC's 
Identity Theft Clearinghouse, you may contact FDLE.  FDLE Special Agents who 
work  identity  theft  cases  may  be  able  to  provide  additional  guidance  and 
assistance.    Check  your  phone  book  to  find  the  nearest  FDLE  Regional 
Operations Center or visit www.fdle.state.fl.us   

 
 
Remove your personal identifiers from Florida court records. 

Any  person  has  the  right  to  request  the  Clerk  or  County  Recorder  to 
redact/remove his or her Social Security number, bank account number, credit, 
debit or charge card number from an image or copy of an Official Record that has 
been  placed  on  such  Clerk's/County  Recorder's  publicly  available  Internet 
website, or in a court file.  If you believe your personal information appears in a 
publicly available record, contact your County Clerk's Office to initiate a request.  
A listing of all County Clerks can be found at www.flclerks.com  

 
 
Report Mail Theft to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. 

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will investigate if your mail has been stolen by 
an identity thief and used to obtain new credit or commit fraud. Incidents should 
be reported to your nearest U.S. Postal Inspection Service district office.  Check 
your telephone book for your local office or visit www.usps.com 

 
 
Report Passport Fraud to the U.S. Department of State. 

If  your  passport  is  lost  or  stolen,  or  you  believe  it  is  being  used  fraudulently, 
contact your local Department of State field office.  Check your telephone book 
for your local office or visit www.state.gov  

 
 
Protect your Social Security number.  

The  Social  Security  Administration  can  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  earnings 
reported  on  your  social  security  number.  To  check  for  inaccuracies  or  fraud, 
order a copy of your Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) 
from  the  Social  Security  Administration  by  calling  1-800-772-1213  or  visiting 
www.ssa.gov

Instructions for

Completing the ID Theft Affidavit

To make certain that you do not become

responsible for the debts incurred by the identity
thief, you must provide proof that you didnt
create the debt to each of the companies where
accounts were opened or used in your name.

A working group composed of credit grant-
ors, consumer advocates and the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) developed this ID Theft
Affidavit to help you report information to many
companies using just one standard form. Use of
this affidavit is optional. While many companies
accept this affidavit, others require that you
submit more or different forms. Before you send
the affidavit, contact each company to find out if
they accept it.

You can use this affidavit where a new ac-

count was opened in your name. The information
will enable the companies to investigate the fraud
and decide the outcome of your claim. (If some-
one made unauthorized charges to an existing
account, call the company to find out what to
do.)

This affidavit has two parts:

 ID Theft Affidavit is where you report general

information about yourself and the theft.

 Fraudulent Account Statement is where

you describe the fraudulent account(s) opened
in your name. Use a separate Fraudulent Ac-
count Statement for each company you need to
write to.

When you send the affidavit to the compa-

nies, attach copies (NOT originals) of any support-
ing documents (e.g., drivers license, police report)
you have.

 Before submitting your affidavit, review the

disputed account(s) with family members or

friends who may have information about the
account(s) or access to them.

Complete this affidavit as soon as pos-
sible.  Many creditors ask that you send it within
two weeks of receiving it. Delaying could slow the
investigation.

Be as accurate and complete as possible.

You may choose not to provide some of the
information requested. However, incorrect or
incomplete information will slow the process of
investigating your claim and absolving the debt.
Please print clearly.

When you have finished completing the
affidavit, mail a copy to each creditor, bank or
company that provided the thief with the unautho-
rized credit, goods or services you describe.
Attach to each affidavit a copy of the Fraudulent
Account Statement with information only on
accounts opened at the institution receiving the
packet, as well as any other supporting documen-
tation you are able to provide.

Send the appropriate documents to each

company by certified mail, return receipt
requested, so you can prove that it was received.
The companies will review your claim and send
you a written response telling you the outcome of
their investigation.  Keep a copy of everything
you submit for your records.

If you cannot complete the affidavit, a legal

guardian or someone with power of attorney may
complete it for you. Except as noted, the informa-
tion you provide will be used only by the company
to process your affidavit, investigate the events
you report and help stop further fraud. If this
affidavit is requested in a lawsuit, the company
might have to provide it to the requesting party.
Completing this affidavit does not guarantee

that the identity thief will be prosecuted or that
the debt will be cleared.
