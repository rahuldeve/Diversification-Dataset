Cyber risks: A severe and 
present danger

Cybersecurity is  
now a persistent 
business risk

It is no longer an issue that 
concerns only information 
technology and security 
professionals; the impact 
has extended to the C-suite 
and boardroom. 

Awareness and concern about 
security incidents and threats  
also has become top of mind among 
consumers as well. In short, few  
risk issues are as all-encompassing  
as cybersecurity. 

Media reports of security incidents 
have become as commonplace as the  
weather forecast, and over the past 
12 months virtually every industry 
sector across the globe has been hit 
by some type of cyber threat. 

Following are but a few: As incidents 
proliferate, governments are 
becoming more proactive in helping 
organizations fight cyber crime. 

The US Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), for example, 
disclosed that it notified 3,000 
companiesincluding banks, 
retailers, and defense contractors
that they had been victims of 
cybersecurity breaches in 2013.1

Subsequently, the US Department of 
Justice (DOJ) charged five Chinese  
military hackers with conducting 
cyber economic espionage against 
American companies in the nuclear 
power, metals, and solar energy 
sectors.2 This marked the first 
time that the US has charged state 
officials with economic espionage 
using external cyber attacks under 
section 1831 of the Economic 
Espionage Act.

Its a trend that will likely 
continue, according to Sean 
Joyce, PwC principal and former 
deputy director of the FBI. I 
think we will see the DOJ and  
FBI continue to pursue an 
aggressive strategy against 
nation-state actors that cause 
significant economic damage to 
the US economy, says Joyce.

Assaults on major retailers reached 
epic levels in the past year, resulting 
in the theft of hundreds of millions  
of customer payment card records,  
a rash of litigation, and a rush to adopt  
a new payment card standard in the 
US. In the UK, payroll information 
and bank account numbers of 100,000 
employees of a supermarket chain 
were stolen by a company insider  
and published online.3

Stock exchanges also have become routine targets 
 
A survey of 46 global securities exchanges conducted by 
the International Organization of Securities Commissions 
(IOSCO) and the World Federation of Exchanges Office 
found that more than half (53%) had experienced  
a cyber attack.8

Huge heists of consumer data were 
also reported in South Korea, where 
105 million payment card accounts 
were exposed in a security breach.4 
And in Verden, Germany, city officials 
announced the theft of 18 million 
e-mail addresses, passwords, and 
other information.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The retail attacks did much to elevate 
awareness of cyber threats, as did 
media coverage of the breach by 
former contractor Edward J. Snowden. 
The revelations of cyber surveillance 
of individuals, businesses, and nations 
has also prompted many international 
businesses and governments to 
reconsider purchase of products and 
services from companies that may be 
affiliated with government entities.

Other examples of state-sponsored 
espionage were uncovered by security 
firm Symantec, which discovered 
attacks against major European 
governments that has been under 
way for at least four years. Because  
of the chosen targets and sophisticated  
malware employed, Symantec believes  
a state-sponsored group is coordinating  
the attacks.6

Geopolitical discord, most notably 
between Russia and Ukraine, resulted 
in a volley of cyber attacks between 
the two nations that took down and 
defaced government websites on both 
sides of the conflict, as well as spread 
malware to the computers of embassies. 

Financial services 
companies continued  
to be major targets

Cyber thieves plundered more  
than $45 million from worldwide 
ATM accounts of two banks  
in the Middle East.7 

Other critical infrastructure 
providers are also under attack.

A hacker group successfully infiltrated 
a US public utility via the Internet 
and compromised its control system 
network, although the intrusion 
was halted before any damage was 
done.9 And sophisticated state-backed 
cyber adversaries employed powerful 
malware to infect the industrial 
control systems of hundreds of 
energy companies across the US  
and Europe.10

Cyber risks: A severe and present dangerAnd the risks go 
beyond devices

Security firm IOActive has 
published research that  
demonstrates in detail  
how hackers can control 
the Electronic Control Units 
of specific automobiles and  
proposes mechanisms to 
detect attacks.14

Even those reporting the cybersecurity 
intrusions were not immune. Some 
of the worlds most trusted news 
organizations, including The New 
York Times, The Financial Times, CNN, 
and Reuterswere taken down or 
compromised in the past year. Many 
of the most prominent attacks were 
carried out by hackers tied to a Middle 
Eastern government.

This list is by no means exhaustive. 
It will always be difficult to know 
exactly what organizations have been 
compromised because many simply 
dont realize that they have been 
attacked or are under attack. Others 
may be reluctant to reveal known 
compromises for very real fear of 
reputational damage, lawsuits, and 
regulatory investigations.

Indeed, regulators around the world 
are beginning to more proactively 
address cyber risks. 

In an indicator of how the regulatory 
landscape is evolving, the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC Office of Compliance Inspections 
and Examinations (OCIE) recently 
announced that it plans to examine the 
cybersecurity preparedness of more 
than 50 registered broker-dealers and 
investment advisers.15 In Asia, the 
Singapore Personal Data Protection 
Act establishes new standards for  
the collection, use, and disclosure  
of personal data. 

Organizations that do not comply 
with the act are subject to financial 
penalties of up to $1 million (SGD) 
or $788,995 (USD).17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The new guidance highlights several 
unique requirements, such as 
suggesting that organizations have 
cyber insurance and be able to produce 
a comprehensive inventory of all 
security incidents and breaches. SEC 
guidance also requires that businesses 
implement risk-assessment processes, 
as well as more effectively assess 
vendor risks and due diligence.

One of the years most far-reaching 
incidents was the Heartbleed defect, 
which impacted almost two-thirds 
of web servers around the world, 
including some of the most popular 
e-mail and social networking sites.11 
It is believed to have compromised 
millions of websites, online shopping 
destinations, and security applications, 
as well as software like instant 
messaging, remote access tools, 
and networking devices. In the 
first intrusion attributed to the 
Heartbleed defect, a US hospital 
chain reported theft of 4.5 million 
patient records in August.12

We also saw increases in attacks  
on connected consumer devices 
such as baby monitors, home  
thermostats, and televisions 
that comprise the Internet of Things, 
a nascent ecosystem of devices that 
interconnect information, operational, 
and consumer technologies. These 
Internet-connected devices are 
vulnerable to attack because they lack 
fundamental security safeguards, a 
point verified by a recent HP Fortify 
on Demand study. 

HP reviewed 10 of the most 
commonly used connected devices 
and found that 70% contain 
serious vulnerabilities.13

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015It was widely reported that 
automobiles, which contain dozens 
of computers that are often linked 
to one another and, in some cases, 
communicate wirelessly with the 
outside world, can be hacked to 
control the brakes, steering, and 
even engines. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Executives of multinational 
organizations are keeping an eye 
on European Union Data Protection 
Regulation, which is on track to be  
finalized in 2015. The regulation is 
expected to add new requirements 
for breach notification to individuals, 
require organizations that handle 
personal data to conduct risk 
assessments and audits, and increase 
fines for compromised businesses.16

The EU General Data Protection 
Regulations breach notification 
requirements may increase disclosure 
of security incidents in Europe, 
according to John W. Woods, Jr., 
co-leader of the global cybersecurity 
practice for the law firm Baker & 
McKenzie LLP. In the US, state 
data-breach notification statutes 
have resulted in the disclosure of 
a significant number of security 
breaches which in turn has raised the 
consciousness around cybersecurity 
issues, Woods says. It will be 
interesting to see if the proposed EU 
data-breach notification has a similar 
impact. If it parallels the experience 
in the US, I think we very well may 
see a proliferation of incidents 
reported in Europe.

We have also seen new 
government efforts to help 
organizations improve 
their cybersecurity posture 
on a voluntary basis.

In the US, the Presidents 2013 
Executive Order on improving 
cybersecurity produced the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. 
Version 1.0 of the voluntary standard 
is being implemented by individual 
companies to assess and improve 
cybersecurity, as well as to create a 
common language for discussion and 
collaboration on security intelligence 
and response tactics.

Private-sector efforts to advance 
security include the launch of Googles 
Project Zero initiative, which aims to 
advance security by identifying and 
stopping zero-day threats (unknown 
and unpatched code flaws) before 
hackers can exploit them. Google 
says Project Zero researchers will 
work to enhance the security of 
widely used software, as well as study 
the motivations and techniques of 
attackers and conduct research into 
effective monitoring and mitigation  
of cyber compromises.18

Cyber risks: A severe and present dangerCybersecurity 
services market 
is expanding

In the wake of increased 
incidents and heightened 
regulations, corporations 
and government agencies 
are scrambling to safeguard 
their data and networks 
a push that is catalyzing 
growth in the market for 
cybersecurity solutions  
and technologies.

Research firm Gartner predicts that  
global IT security spending will 
increase 7.9% to $71.1 billion in 2014, 
and grow an additional 8.2% to reach 
$76.9 billion in 2015, according to  
The Wall Street Journal.19

The upsurge in security incidents  
and the resulting media coverage  
has helped unleash a flood of venture 
capital investment in companies that  
provide cybersecurity software, 
solutions, and services. 

During the first six months of 2014, 
venture capital firms invested $894 
million in US cybersecurity startups, 
almost the same amount invested in 
all of 2013.20 That puts the sector on 
track to post the highest investments 
in more than a decade. At the same 
time, the market capitalizations of 
some security firms hit new highs  
in the past year.

Network security provider FireEye, 
after a $304 million initial public 
offering (IPO) in 2013, now has a 
market cap of approximately  

$4.6

Alto Networks raised $260 million

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015At the height of the venture-
funding boom, the valuation 
of some cybersecurity 
companies was five-to-ten 
times their annual revenues  
in 2013. 

The market is starting to self-adjust, 
however, as investment in cybersecurity 
companies has cooled in recent months. 
As a result, some prominent firms have 
lost more than half of their previous 
market caps.

We believe the cybersecurity software, 
solutions, and services market is likely 
to remain a growth sector because 
executives and Boards recognize that 
cyber threats will never be completely 
eliminated, and regulatory and 
compliance requirements will likely 
become more stringent.

Against this backdrop of elevated risks, 
regulation, and market activity, we 
present the results of this years survey.

Venture capital investments  
in cybersecurity firms are 
also accelerating in Europe. 

It has also been an active year 
for mergers and acquisitions  
of cybersecurity firms.

Cyber risks: A severe and present danger02

Incidents and financial impacts 
continue to soar

Continued year-
over-year rise  
is no surprise

Given the nature and 
number of very prominent 
security breaches over the  
past year, it comes as no 
surprise that incidents 
reported by respondents 
to The Global State of 
Information Security 
Survey 2015 continued a 
year-over-year rise.

The annual survey of more than 9,700 
security, IT, and business executives 
found that the total number of 
security incidents detected by 
respondents climbed to 42.8 million 
this year, an increase of 48% over 
2013. Thats the equivalent of 117,339 
incoming attacks per day, every day.

Taking a longer view, our survey  
data shows that the compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of detected 
security incidents has increased 66% 
year-over-year since 2009.

Figure 2
Security incidents grow 66% CAGR
Total number of detected incidents

These numbers are by no means 
definitive, however; they represent 
only the total incidents detected and 
reported. As noted, many organizations 
are unaware of attacks, while others 
do not report detected incidents for 
strategic reasons or because the attack 
is being investigated as a matter  
of national security.

It seems certain, given the technical 
sophistication of todays well-funded 
threat actors, that a substantial 
number of incidents are successful 
but not discovered. In fact, one 
cybersecurity firm recently estimated 
that as many as 71% of compromises 
go undetected.25

When it comes to 
discovering incidents, one 
thing is very clear: Large 
companies have the edge 
over smaller firms.

Among our global survey sample, 
large organizations (those with gross 
annual revenues of $1 billion or 
more) detected 44% more incidents 
compared with last year. The fact 
that big companies detect more 
incidents is not surprising.

Threat actors often target large 
organizations because they typically 
offer a rich trove of information
including trade-strategy documents, 
intellectual property related to 
product design, and large volumes 
of consumer datathat can be 
exploited, sold, or used for economic 
or military gain. Larger companies 
also typically have more mature 
security processes and technologies 
in place, which allows them to 
uncover more incidents.

As larger companies continue to 
implement more effective security 
safeguards, threat actors are 
increasingly stepping up their assaults 
on middle-tier companies, many of 
which may not have security practices 
that match the maturity of bigger 
businesses. That, in part, explains 
the 64% jump in the number of 
incidents detected by medium-size 
organizations (those with revenues  
of $100 million to $1 billion). 

Small organizations proved the 
exception in discovering compromises. 
Companies with revenues of less 
than $100 million detected 5% fewer 
incidents this year. The reasons are not 
immediately clear, but one explanation 
may be that small companies are 
investing less in information security, 
which may leave them both incapable 
of detecting incidents and a more 
tempting target to cyber adversaries.

Small firms often consider themselves 
too insignificant to attract threat 
actorsa dangerous misperception. 
Its also important to note that 
sophisticated adversaries often target 
small and medium-size companies 
as a means to gain a foothold on the 
interconnected business ecosystems 
of larger organizations with which 
they partner. This dangerous reality 
is compounded by the fact that big 
companies often make little effort to 
monitor the security of their partners, 
suppliers, and supply chains. 

8

Incidents and financial impacts continue to soarThe lack of due diligence into third 
parties has become so prevalent that 
an increasing number of regulators 
now require assessment of partner 
and supply-chain security capabilities. 
To catch up, small businesses might 
consider outsourcing elements of 
their cybersecurity programs to take 
advantage of economies of scale. 

While big corporations may have the 
expertise and resources to build a 
sophisticated cybersecurity fusion 
center that enables sharing of threat 
intelligence and response techniques, 
that is not practical for smaller firms. 
But they can obtain the same benefits 
through managed security services. 
Another option to address risks might 
be purchase of cyber insurance.

Looking at security incidents across 
geographic regions, cybercrime is 
rising significantly in Europe, which 
reported a 41% jump in the number  
of incidents detected over 2013.

To improve their security posture, 
one option that small and medium 
companies might pursue is 
consideration of managed security 
services. This can enable them to 
employ sophisticated technologies 
and processes to detect security 
incidents in a cost-effective manner.

It very well may be that Europe  
leads in detecting incidents because 
the Continent reports a healthy 12% 
bump in security spending, among 
the highest of all regions. 

In North America, respondents 
detected 11% more incidents this 
year. Asia Pacific respondents  
seem less adept at discovering 
incidents, reporting a 5% increase  
in detections. 

South America was the only region 
to show a decline in the detection 
of compromises: The number of 
incidents dipped 9%. Its worth noting 
that information security spending 
dropped 24% in South America, 
significantly more than other regions.

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015Financial losses 
increase apace 

As security incidents grow 
in frequency, the costs of 
managing and mitigating 
breaches also are rising. 

Globally, the annual estimated 
reported average financial loss 
attributed to cybersecurity incidents 
was $2.7 million, a jump of 34%  
over 2013. 

Not surprising in light of last years 
prominent breaches, is the finding 
that big losses are more common: 
Organizations reporting financial hits 
of $20 million or more increased  
92% over 2013.

The rise in security incidents would  
account for some of this increase in  
financial losses, of course. But another 
explanation might be that todays 
more sophisticated compromises 
often extend beyond IT to other areas 
of the business, according to William 
Boni, corporate information security 
officer for T-Mobile US. 

Financial losses may now 
include remediation for 
monitoring of external customer 
impacts, as opposed to just 
operational distruptions inside 
an organizations firewall,  
says Boni.

As with the total number of incidents, 
the global cost of cybercrime is 
ultimately unknowable because 
many attacks are not reported 
and the value of certain types of 
information, intellectual property 
in particular, is difficult to calculate. 
A recent study by the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies 
noted the difficulties in estimating 
financial impact but estimated that 
the annual cost of cybercrime to the 
global economy ranges from $375 
billion to as much as $575 billion.26

If that figure seems high, it doesnt even 
approach the estimates of losses that 
can result from theft of trade secrets 
and intellectual property. The impact 
of this type of information loss can 
be measured by financial and non-
financial indicators.

Incidents and financial impacts continue to soarFinancial impact may include 
decreased revenues, disruption of 
business systems, regulatory penalties, 
and erosion of customers. 

Non-financial impact may include 
reputational damage, the pirating  
of products, diversion of research and  
development information, impacts 
to innovation, stolen product designs 
or prototypes, theft of business and 
manufacturing processes, as well  
as loss of sensitive information such 
as M&A plans and corporate strategy.

Using the World Banks annual 
global GDP estimate of $74.9 trillion 
in 2013, loss of trade secrets may 
range from $749 billion to as high 
as $2.2 trillion annually.28

Measured across these 
vectors, financial damages 
can be significantly  
higher than traditional 
measures. 

Consider that the Center for 
Responsible Enterprise And Trade 
(CREATe.org), in conjunction with 
PwC, estimated that the impact  
of trade-secret theft ranges from 
1% to 3% of a nations annual gross 
domestic product (GDP).27 Potential 
losses seem even more menacing 
when the likelihood of cybersecurity 
compromise is factored in.

In its 2014 global risk report, the World 
Economic Forum rated cyber attacks among  
its top five risks in terms of likelihood.29 The 
possibility of compromise is a threat that is  
not lost on many senior executives.

11

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015Almost half (48%) of respondents 
to PwCs 2014 Global Economic 
Crime Survey said the perception of 
cybercrime risk to their organization 
had increased in the past year, up 
from 39% in 2011.30 In other words, 
executives clearly recognize that 
cyber threats have become a serious 
enterprise risk-management issue. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

While risk has become universal, our 
security survey found that financial 
losses due to security incidents vary 
widely by organizational size. To 
understand these discrepancies, 
we looked into how organizations 
measure the financial impact of 
security incidents. Large companies 
typically spend more on information 
security and have a more mature 
program.

As a result, they are more likely to 
have the processes and knowledge  
to accurately calculate financial 
losses. Accordingly, they may consider  
a full range of possible impacts, 
including costs associated with loss 
of customer business, legal defense 
fees, court settlements, forensics, 
and reputational damage.

Larger organizations also take a 
more strategic approach to security 
by identifying sensitive assets and 
allocating spending to their most 
valuable data, and they are likely  
to understand third-party risks 
through the use of security baselines 
for partners. 

Large companies tend to have the 
processes and technologies in place  
to actively monitor and analyze 
security intelligence; should 
anomalies be detected, they are in  
a better position to have an incident-
response process at the ready. 

And big organizations more frequently 
cultivate a culture of security through 
employee awareness and training 
programs, as well as by ensuring 
that senior executives broadcast the 
importance of cybersecurity across 
the enterprise.

Small companies report that the cost  
of incidents actually decreased 37%  
compared with last year, while large 
companies report a 53% jump in 
financial damages. Medium-size 
organizations landed somewhere in 
the middle, reporting that the costs 
of incidents rose 25% over the  
year before.

While theres no doubt that these 
actors are a force to be reckoned 
with, insiderscurrent and former 
employees, in particularhave 
become the most-cited culprits of 
cybercrime. Thats not to say that 
all employees exhibit malicious 
behavior, however. In many cases, 
they may unwittingly compromise 
data through loss of mobile devices 
or targeted phishing schemes.

The jump in insider 
incidents may carry 
serious implications.

In the 2014 US State of Cybercrime 
Survey, we found that almost one-
third (32%) of respondents said 
insider crimes are more costly or 
damaging than incidents perpetrated 
by outsiders.31 Yet many companies do 
not have an insider-threat program in 
place, and are therefore not prepared 
to prevent, detect, and respond to 
internal threats.

Its a risk that PwCs Joyce has 
seen first hand. Based on my 
experience with the [Chelsea] 
Manning and Snowden leaks, 
and with managing one of the 
leading insider programs within 
the intelligence community,  
I have seen that organizations 
sometimes overlook the threat 
from within their own business 
ecosystem, says Joyce. The 
effects can be devastating.

Another threat lies in the fact that 
organizations often handle remediation 
of insider cybercrime internally. In 
fact, 75% of respondents to the US 
cybercrime survey said they did not 
involve law enforcement or bring legal 
charges in compromises committed 
by insiders.32 In doing so, they may 
leave other organizations vulnerable 
to risks because those that hire these 
individuals in the future have no way 
to assess their threat potential.

Employees are the most-cited culprits of incidentsInsidersOutsidersEmployees are not the  
only source of rising insider 
threats, however.

The percentage of incidents attributed 
to current and former service providers, 
consultants, and contractors increased 
to 18% and 15%, respectively, in 2014. 

This is a threat that has been made  
all too apparent by a rampage of attacks  
on US retailers over the past year, some 
of which were achieved by criminals 
who gained access to the networks 
and point-of-sale systems of retailers 
through compromises of third-party  
suppliers and contractors.

Labeling 2013 as the year of the 
retailer breach, Verizon counted 467 
retailer breaches around the world in 
its annual Data Breach Investigations 
Report, noting that payment card data  
was the primary target in 95% of 
incidents within the retail industry.33

It looks as if 2014 will be another year 
of unprecedented breaches. As we 
prepared this report, news broke of 
another US retailer heist that resulted 
in the loss of 56 million payment 
card records.34

Among retailer and consumer 
companies, we found a noticeable 
jump in those who attribute  
security incidents to current 
service providers and 
contractors (23%) as well as 
former partners (45%). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

If there is an upside to these 
compromises, its that they have 
spurred stakeholders in the US payment 
card industry to move from the existing 
magnetic-stripe technology to EMV, 
a more secure microprocessor-based 
standard that is less vulnerable  
to compromise.

High growth 
in high-profile 
crimes

Cyber incidents that garner 
the most attention
compromises by nation-
states, organized crime, 
and competitorsremain 
among the least frequent.

Thats of little comfort, however, 
considering that our survey results 
show these attacks are among the 
fastest-growing threats.

Its a growing concern for many 
organizations, according to Lisa 
J. Sotto, a partner of the legal 
firm Hunton & Williams who 
specializes in cybersecurity and 
privacy issues. I have seen a huge 
increase in the number of nation-
state attackers who are seeking 
IP, blueprints, M&A data, and 
R&D, says Sotto. The number of  
attacks by organized crime rings 
also appears to be at an all-time 
high, and the level of organization 
and infrastructure of these crime 
rings is unprecedented.

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015Nation-states often target critical infrastructure providers 
and suppliers to steal IP and trade secrets as a means to 
advance their own political and economic advantages. It 
isnt surprising, therefore, to find that nation-state incidents 
are most frequent among sectors such as oil and gas 
(11%), aerospace and defense (9%), technology (9%),  
and telecommunications (8%). 

Survey results square with that 
assessment from the field. This year, we 
found an 86% increase in respondents 
who say they have been compromised 
by nation-states. Given the ability of 
nation-state adversaries to carry out 
attacks without detection, we believe 
the volume of compromises is very 
likely under-reported.

The boost in incidents attributed to 
nation-states may be due, in some 
part, to geopolitical events in Eastern 
Europe and the Middle East, which 
have coincided with an increase in 
distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attacks and the use of sophisticated 
espionage spyware.

The battle against nation-state crime 
is compounded by the fact that timely 
sharing of cyber-threat intelligence is 
a challenge for most countries. Only 
a few, such as the US, Canada, the 
United Kingdom, Australia, and New 
Zealand, have the ability to effectively 
share cyber-attack information with 
companies headquartered in their 
respective countries. 

Improvement of security intelligence-
sharing capabilities could prove a 
significant economic advantage to 
both nations and their businesses. 
Whats more, the combination of 
effective information sharing and the 
security research being conducted 
by private companies like Google 
may eventually make cybercrime less 
lucrative for adversaries by requiring 
that they invest more in technology 
and attack-process capabilities.

We also found a striking 64% jump 
in security incidents attributed to 
competitors, some of whom may be 
backed by nation-states. Nowhere 
was this problem more acute than 
in Asia Pacific, and specifically 
in China. Almost half (47%) of 
respondents from China pointed 
to competitors as the source of 
security incidents, higher than any 
other nation.

The reason for this increase may be 
that companies are discovering that, 
as information is increasingly stored 
in digital formats, it is easier, cheaper, 
and quicker to steal IP and trade 
secrets than to develop capabilities 
themselves. In carrying out attacks, 
competitors often fuse sophisticated 
high-tech techniques with other 
methods such as recruiting employees 
of the targeted company, bribery, 
extortion, and the promise of a new 
job. The rise in cybercrimes attributed 
to nation-states and competitors is 
concurrent with an increase in theft 
of intellectual property and other 
types of sensitive information. 

This year, IP theft increased 19% 
over 2013. Almost one-in-four (24%) 
respondents report theft of soft 
intellectual property, which includes 
information on processes and 
institutional knowledge. Fewer (15%) 
say hard intellectual property, 
such as strategic business plans, deal 
documents, and sensitive financial 
documents, was stolen.

16

Employees are the most-cited culprits of incidentsOil and gasTechnologyAerospace and defenseTelecommunicationsThis year, 15% of survey respondents cited 
organized crime as a source of incidents, up from  
12% last year. By region, theft by organized 
criminals was particularly high in Malaysia (35%),  
India (22%), and Brazil (18%).

IP theft is highest among respondents 
from aerospace and defense, an 
industry whose trade secrets can 
include sensitive information 
that may be critical to a countrys 
national security. 

This year, aerospace and defense 
respondents reported a 97% 
increase in hard IP theft and a 
66% jump in soft IP compromise
higher by far than any other sector. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Compromises by organized 
crime also are on the rise.

Organized crime groups are typically  
motivated by financial gain. A 
successful cyber attack can net 
millions of payment card records 
that  can be quickly monetized. 

In addition to credit and debit card 
data, these criminals increasingly 
target patient health care data or other 
personally identified information 
that has considerable value in the 
underworld of information resellers.

In the US alone, financial losses due 
to personal identity theft, which  
includes misuse of payment cards, 
bank accounts, and personal 
information, totaled $24.7 billion in  
2012, according to the Bureau of  
Justice Statistics.35 The recent theft  
of more than a billion user credentials  
by organized criminals illustrates that  
these attacks are growing in scope.

In response, law-enforcement 
agencies across the world are 
beginning to band together 
to fight organized criminals, 
according to cybersecurity 
attorney Woods. There has 
been an increased cross-border 
recognition of the need for more 
coordinated law-enforcement 
efforts to identify incidents 
caused by organized crime, he 
says. I think this will accelerate 
in the coming years through 
organizations like Interpol.

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015Globally, 59% of respondents  
say their organizations executives 
are worried about government 
surveillance. Concerns are 
markedly higher in China (93%), 
India (83%), and Brazil (77%).

This concern carries potentially 
broad implications for some 
telecommunications and high- 
technology companies. Firms in the  
US, in particular, and Europe have  
traditionally dominated the market  
for telecommunications and corporate  
networking equipment. But Asian 
companies are making inroads, and 
their prospects brightened after it was 
disclosed that the US government 
had collected sensitive information 
from some domestic technology  
and telecom firms.

As a result, organizations in some 
nations report they are reconsidering 
the procurement of equipment from 
certain manufacturers. In fact,  
42% of respondents say the purchase 
of products and services originating  
in certain nations is under review, 
and 29% say they now purchase 
fewer products and services from 
some nations.

The Snowden effect, which helped 
consumers understand the concept  
of Big Data analytics, has also raised  
a red flag among individuals. In fact,  
the Snowden leaks and the proliferation  
of Big Data have elevated the issue of 
personal privacy to a matter of public 
debate. The White House responded 
by publishing this year two high-
profile papers on the impact of Big 
Data to the privacy of consumer 
information. These government 
studies underscore the importance 
of integrating a strategy for Big 
Data security and consumer privacy 
to protect information and gain 
competitive advantages.36

Domestic 
intelligence:  
A new source  
of concern 

Edward J. Snowdens 
disclosures of government 
surveillance have added a  
new adversary to the threat  
environment: domestic 
intelligence services.

As a result of the Snowden leaks, 
nations, businesses, and society in 
general have become increasingly 
skeptical of domestic surveillance and 
are concerned about potential impact 
on data privacy and security. 

The headline-making nature of the  
Snowden revelations has resulted in 
considerable awareness and concern 
among business executives. Not only 
are they raising questions about 
government surveillance, but also 
regarding the telecommunications 
and technology companies that may 
have provided government access  
to data. 

The issues that most worry executives?  
The privacy of personal data, potential legal  
risks, and loss of intellectual property.

Employees are the most-cited culprits of incidents04

As incidents rise, security 
spending falls

Organizations 
are undoubtedly 
worried about 
the rising tide of 
cybercrime

PwCs Global Economic 
Crime Survey 2014 found 
that almost half (48%) 
of global respondents 
said their perception of 
cybercrime risk increased, 
up from 39% in 2011.37

At the same time, PwCs 2014 Annual 
CEO Survey reported that 48% of 
global CEOs are concerned about 
cyber threats to their organization, 
including a lack of data security.38

Despite elevated concerns, our survey 
found that global IS budgets actually 
decreased 4% compared with 2013. In 
fact, security spending as a percentage 
of IT budget has remained stalled at 
4% or less for the past five years.

Information security is a risk 
issue, not an IT issue, Sotto says. 
Information security should be  
a distinct function, with a separate 
governance structure and a separate 
budget so that appropriate resources 
are given to information security. 
Having CISOs report to the head  
of IT is a vestige.

No matter where the security function 
reports, it seems counter-intuitive that, 
as threats become more frequent and 
costly, organizations have not stepped 
up investment in security initiatives. 
This finding is also puzzling in light of 
Gartners forecast for a 7.9% increase 
in security spending for 2014.39

We found one explanation for the 
spending slow-down by looking at 
investment levels reported in last 
years survey. In 2013, organizations 
reported very significant increases  
in spending over 2012, expanding  
IT investments by 40% and security 
spending by an even more substantial 
51%. It could be that this years 
respondents were hard-pressed 
to continue investments at that 
accelerated pace.

Looking at security 
investment by company 
size also sheds some light 
on the anemic funding. 

This year, companies with revenues 
less than $100 million say they 
reduced security investments by  
20% over 2013, while medium  
and large companies report a 5% 
increase in security spending.

That represents a significant level 
of spending, according to T-Mobiles 
Boni. One variable is a reluctance 
to increase spending during the 
recent economic recovery, says 
Boni. I think a 5% increase is a 
pretty substantial level of attention 
since companies are starving other 
corporate areas and want to keep 
costs tightly under control. 

Another explanation could be that 
more targeted security practices 
has enabled organizations to 
strategically optimize spending. 
I think we are heading toward 
a paradigm shift in the way we 
spend on information security, 
says Fernando Camarotti, chief 
information security officer of 
Vale, a global metals and mining 
company based in Rio de Janeiro. 
In the past, the big spending 
projects tended to lock down all 
the data, but thats no longer 
seen as effective. In addition to 
traditional information security 
controls for the entire company, 
we worked to find where we  
had confidential information 
that needed to be protected. 
When you do that, the security 
investment can be more effective 
and much smarter.

Figure 7

dipped to $4.1 million, down 4% over last  
year. Security spending remains stalled 
at only 3.8% of the overall IT budget.

This diminished spending among 
small organizations begs the 
question: Are they simply giving  
up on cybersecurity? We cant be 
sure, but we certainly hope not. 
As noted, smaller businesses often 
believe they are too insignificant to 
draw the attention of serious hackers 
and organized crime. It also may be 
that rising risks, combined with an 
overabundance of security solutions, 
has resulted in analysis paralysis, 
leaving smaller firms unable to make 
decisions and take action.

It could also be fatigue, says 
cybersecurity attorney Sotto.  
The entire issue of cybersecurity  
is so daunting, particularly for  
small companies that dont have  
the appropriately skilled people,  
or credentialed people at the helm  
of the IS function, Sotto says.

As incidents rise, security spending falls  
 
 
 
 
Information security  
budgets are declining  
steeply among organizations  
in the aerospace and defense 
(-25%), technology (-21%), 
automotive (-16%), and retail  
and consumer products  
(-15%) industries. In some  
sectors, overall business trends 
account for these drops.

Its also possible that, due to the 
ongoing shortage of experienced 
security professionals, the most 
skilled candidates are hired by bigger 
organizations with hefty budgets. 

Among larger companies, an  
explanation for limited growth of 
security spending might be that, as the 
global economy continues to recover, 
more corporations are hoarding 
more cash and investing less in IT 
and security. Its obvious, however, 
that businesses are spending in  
some areas, most notably research 
and development. 

Annual expenditures among the 
worlds 1,000 biggest R&D spenders 
hit a record $638 billion in 2013, a 
6% increase over the year before.40

We also believe many organizations 
struggle to understand how much 
to spend on security and how to 
determine the return on investments 
of their security outlay. In part, thats 
because there is no definitive data on 
current security risks to help inform 
a security spending strategy. 

It also seems likely that, since only  
40% of respondents say their  
Board is involved in security budget 
decisions, many may have trouble 
achieving robust funding in security. 
And, we also hear that many senior 
executives and Boards often find it 
difficult to understand how security 
technology works and identify the 
related tactical risks.

Looking at security 
investments by industry 
shows that spending is down 
in most sectors, with a  
few notable exceptions.

While the revenues and spending 
among airline manufacturers are  
up, for instance, defense spending  
is dropping among developing 
nations. This is particularly true in 
the United States after its pullout 
from Afghanistan and Iraq and 
subsequent defense budget cuts.  
And while the decline in the retail 
and consumer industry spending 
may seem puzzling given widely 
reported breaches, consider that 
2014 security budgets may have  
been in place for the year before  
the incidents were reported.

The typical CIO or CFO will spend money when there is  
documented proof a problem may result in real hurt, says Boni 
of T-Mobile. When that is lacking, its very difficult to accurately 
quantify the business impact of new technologies and unknown 
threats. Organizations must be very judicious about every  
nickel they spent on information security.

21

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015These black markets for 
stolen data are growing  
in size and complexity. 

While the number of websites on 
which data is sold is not known, the 
number of criminals who participate 
in these dark bazaars is likely to 
increase because it is becoming easier 
to get involved, according to the 
RAND Corp.42 In part, thats because 
todays black market comprises 
increasingly more websites, forums, 
and chat channels in which goods 
can be bought and sold. 

Industries reporting the most 
significant increases in security 
spending include healthcare providers 
and payers (66%), oil and gas (15%), 
and utilities (9%). The increase in 
spending among healthcare providers 
and payers is particularly striking
but certainly justifiable given current 
risks and trends. This year, healthcare 
providers and payers report a 60% 
increase in detected incidents, with 
financial losses skyrocketing 282% 
over 2013.

The explanation for this snowballing 
volume of incidents and financial 
losses may be that threat actors are 
targeting healthcare providers and 
payers for their increasingly valuable 
patient health data. A health record 
often comprises a full complement 
of informationfinancial, medical, 
family, and personalthat can be 
used to construct a complete identity. 

A complete identity-theft kit containing 
comprehensive health insurance 
credentials can be worth hundreds 
of dollars or even $1,000 each on the 
black market, and health insurance 
credentials alone can fetch $20 each; 
stolen payment cards, by comparison, 
typically are sold for $1 each.41 

Healthcare providers and payers also 
may be boosting security investments 
to prepare for connected health-
monitoring devices and the explosion 
of data that the Internet of Things 
will bring. Indeed, for healthcare 
providers and payers, the Internet of 
Things is not futuristic, nor are the 
risks theoretical.

Consider that almost half (47%) 
of healthcare provider and payer 
respondents say they have integrated 
consumer technologies such as 
wearable health-monitoring devices 
or operational technologies like 
automated pharmacy-dispensing 
systems with their IT ecosystem.

Yet they have not been as quick 
to ensure the security of these 
connected devices. 

 
Just more than one-third (34%) have 
contacted device manufacturers to 
understand the equipments security 
capabilities and risks, and 58% have 
performed a risk assessment of the 
devices or technologies. Only 53% 
have implemented security controls 
for these connected devices.

Declines in fundamental 
security practices

Security 
practices must 
keep pace with 
constantly 
evolving threats 
and security 
requirements 

Doing so will demand 
investments in the right 
processes and technologies 
to prevent, protect, detect, 
and respond to security 
risks. Overall, many 
organizations are failing  
to do so. 

Given todays interconnected 
business ecosystem, in which 
exponentially more data is generated 
and shared with business partners 
and suppliers, an area of specific 
concern is the lack of policies and 
due diligence regarding third 
parties. It is worrisome that the focus 
on third-party security actually 
weakened in the past year in some 
very key areaseven as the number 
of incidents attributed to these 
insiders increased. 

We are seeing third-party vendors 
as a very significant source of 
cyber risk, says attorney Sotto. 
You could have a moat around a 
heavily fortified castle but if the 
bridge is down to your vendors, 
then your fortifications become 
worthless. Sotto says organizations 
should anchor their third-party due 
diligence on three key practices: 

Perform appropriate protections of 
vendors to ensure that they have the 
ability to safeguard the information, 
have robust contractual protection, 
and conduct ongoing monitoring to 
ensure the third party is protecting 
the data.

Based on these criteria, many 
respondents are behind the curve. 
For instance, only 50% say they 
perform risk assessments on third-
party vendors (down from 53% in 
2013), and just 50% say they have 
conducted an inventory of all third 
parties that handle personal data of 
employees and customers. Just over 
half (54%) of respondents say they 
have a formal policy requiring third 
parties to comply with their privacy 
policies, down from 58% in 2013.

This year, 51% of respondents said 
they have a security awareness and 
training program, down from 60% 
last year. A slightly higher number, 
57%, say they require employees to  
complete training on privacy policies. 
 

Employee training and awareness is 
a fundamental component of every 
program because the weakest link 
in the security chain is often human. 
Frequently, the disconnect comes down 
to how organizations engage their 
employees and generate awareness 
through their communications 
programs. 

Consider that 84% of CEOs believe 
their strategic priorities will deliver on 
goals, but only 41% say their employees 
understand the strategy well enough  
to inform decision-making.43

Large organizations are more likely to 
recognize and act upon the importance 
of employee training. We found that 
58% of big companies do so, compared 
with 47% of small firms. 

Security training is most prevalent 
in North America and Asia Pacific, 
and is most likely to be embraced 
by organizations in the healthcare, 
industrial products, and financial 
services sectors. 

Effective security awareness will also 
demand top-down commitment and 
communication, a tactic that is often 
lacking. Only 49% of respondents 
say their organization has a cross-
organizational team that regularly 
convenes to discuss, coordinate, and 
communicate information security 
issues. It also will require that the 
C-suite and Board be directly involved. 

Effective security awareness will require adequate funding, but perhaps 
more importantly it also will demand a commitment to maturity, says 
Gary Hayes, chief information officer of CenterPoint Energy, an electric 
and natural gas utility based in Houston. Accelerating investments 
is not enough he says. You have to mature your organization, your 
people, and your technologies, and that can be a more restraining 
factor than the availability of capital.

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015It is incumbent upon the executive 
team to take ownership of cyber risk 
and ensure that the Board understands 
how the organization will defend 
against and respond to cyber risks. 

The barrage of incidents over the past 
year has resulted in a lot of discussion 
about Board involvement in security. 
Yet for all the chatter, organizations 
clearly have not elevated security to  
a Board-level discussion. 

We know because we asked: Only 
42% of respondents say their Board 
actively participates in the overall 
security strategy and 36% say the 
board is involved in security policies. 
Just 25% say Boards are involved in  
review of current security and privacy  
threatsa crucial component of 
effective information security.

As does he. I report to the broader 
Board twice a year, and I also report 
to the audit committee on a quarterly 
basis, Hayes says. The Board 
definitely requests information about 
whats going on and how we are 
responding because cyber risks have 
been identified as among our top three 
enterprise risk-management issues.

That may be starting to change, 
however. Hayes of CenterPoint 
Energy notes that he attends regular 
meetings with CIOs of 22 large utility 
companies, and virtually all deliver 
security reports to the Board.

Declines in fundamental security practices06

Gains in select security 
initiatives

Increasingly, organizations are 
embracing external collaboration 
to improve security and threat 
intelligence. Hayes of CenterPoint 
says his company actively collaborates 
with several Information Sharing and 
Analysis Centers (ISACs) and industry 
associations, as well as government 
agencies, an initiative that has proven 
to be invaluable.

If you are not connected to the 
conversations, you are going to  
be lost, he says. In todays threat 
environment, there is no reason  
for not collaborating.

Survey respondents are 
starting to see the value of 
working with others. 

This year, 55% of respondents say  
they collaborate with others to  
improve security, an increase of 12%  
over 2013. The larger the company,  
the more likely it is to collaborate with  
others: 66% of large organizations  
do so, compared with 49% of small 
firms. Collaboration is more common 
in regions in which growth in the 
development of IT infrastructure 
has been rapid over the past decade. 
Respondents from South America and 
Asia Pacific, for instance, are more 
likely to work with others to advance 
security intelligence. 

While we found 
declines in 
some security 
practices, we 
also saw gains 
in important 
areas

Cyber risks, technologies, 
and vulnerabilities evolve  
at lightning speed, and 
sharing information among 
public and private entities 
regarding cyber threats 
and responses is central 
to a strong cybersecurity 
program. 

Another area of 
improvement can be seen 
in the adoption of cyber 
insurance as a tool to  
help manage the risks  
of cybercrime. 

In the US, as noted, the SEC 
OCIE guidance has suggested that 
financial services organizations 
purchase cyber insurance as part of 
an effective cyber-risk management 
strategy. Given todays elevated 
threat environment and escalating 
costs of cybercrime, we believe that 
protecting against financial losses 
from cyber risks should rank as high 
as other insurable risks. 

Its an approach that many 
organizations seem to understand. 
More than half (51%) of respondents 
say they have purchased cybersecurity 
insurance, up from 45% last year. 
Perhaps more significant is the finding 
that some companies are leveraging 
cyber insurance as a way to improve 
their security program. More than 
a third (36%) say they have taken 
steps to enhance their security 
posture in order to lower their 
insurance premium. Aerospace and 
defense, automotive, entertainment 
and media, and financial services 
companies are most likely to purchase 
cyber insurance.

As smartphones and tablets become 
ubiquitous, organizations have 
historically lagged in implementing 
security safeguards to counter mobile 
threats. This year we saw some 
notable advances. At the most basic 
level, 54% of respondents say they 
have implemented a mobile security 
strategy. Given the risks of mobility, 
that is still low but it represents an 
improvement over the 42% that had 
a mobile security strategy in 2013.

Similarly, mobile device management 
(MDM) and mobile application 
management (MAM) solutions are 
essential to securing a fleet of devices, 
whether owned by the enterprise 
or the individual. This year, 47% of 
respondents say they employ MDM/
MAM solutions, an improvement 
from last years 39% who did so. 
Nonetheless, there remains much 
opportunity for improvement. 

Not surprisingly, advances in mobile 
security are more prominent among 
larger organizations, which tend to 
have more mature overall security 
programs in place. Financial services, 
telecommunications, and industrial 
products organizations have made 
the most progress in advancing their 
mobile security practices. 

South America leads in adoption of cyber 
insurance, with 58% of respondents saying 
they have purchased policies. The US, 
at 44%, is the region least likely to have 
invested cyber insurance.

Gains in select security initiatives07

Evolving from security to cyber 
risk management

As incidents 
continue to 
proliferate 
across the globe, 
its becoming 
clear that cyber 
risks will never 
be completely 
eliminated

Todays interconnected 
business ecosystem requires 
a shift from security that 
focuses on prevention and 
controls to a risk-based 
approach that prioritizes  
an organizations most 
valuable assets and its most 
relevant threats. 

It also will be critical to focus on rapid  
detection of security intrusions 
and an effective, timely response. 
To get there, businesses should 
reposition their security strategy by 

more closely linking technologies, 
processes, and people skills with 
the organizations broader risk-
management activities. This remains 
a challenge for many businesses, 
according to Boni of T-Mobile.

Its rare that organizations have 
the practioners, tools, and executive 
leadership required to understand 
and respond to security challenges, 
Boni says. Too many people still see 
information security as a principally 
technical problem and believe that 
simply buying the right software 
will cause the problem to go away.
Information security involves people, 
processes, and technologiesgetting 
all three in the right measure is the  
real art of a successful security 
program.

It also can help guide spending on information security. There is  
a lot of uncertainty in return on investment for security. Companies 
often do not know if they are doing a good job, says Boni. There  
is no generally accepted accounting procedure equivalent for baseline 
cybersecurity. Over time, the NIST standard should help create a 
common language and framework to help companies understand  
if theyre doing a good job with their information security 
investments and programs.

Organizations seeking to implement 
the correct mix of people, processes, 
and technologies should consider 
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.  
Even though the Framework targets 
US critical infrastructure providers, 
it offers an effective model for risk-
based security for organizations across 
industries and across the globe. 

We believe it is well worth adopting 
solely for its stated goal of improving 
security. The NIST Framework is a 
great example of the public and private 
sector collaboration that provides  
an excellent agnostic framework  
to cybersecurity, says PwCs Joyce, 
who helped develop the executive 
order that mandated creation of  
the Framework.

Adoption of the Framework also  
can deliver ancillary benefits that 
include enhanced collaboration  
and communication of security 
posture among executives and 
industry organizations, as well as 
potential future improvements in 
legal exposure and even assistance  
with regulatory compliance.44

US organizations are already beginning to embrace 
the NIST Framework. We found that 29% of American 
respondents say they have adopted the Framework, 
and an additional 25% say adoption is a future priority. 

32

Evolving from security to cyber risk management29%25%Organizations that participated in the 
development of the NIST Framework 
are typically early adopters of the 
guidelines. Hayes says CenterPoint 
personnel attended NIST workshops 
and developed a cyber incident 
response plan in tandem with creation 
of the Framework. With this head start,  
the company quickly adopted and 
enhanced its approach by leveraging 
the NIST Framework. The process 
enabled us to enhance aspects 
of cybersecurity that we feel are 
applicable to our space, Hayes says. 
Weve used it to understand what 
we need to do, and to act on that. 

Among the first steps NIST suggests 
is that organizations identify and  
classify their most valuable information 
assets, as well as determine where 
high-value data are located across the  
ecosystem and who has access to them.

For mining company Vale, this initial 
process created a solid foundation 
for its information security program. 
One of the first things we did was to 
identify our confidential information 
and determine where it is stored. says 
Camarotti. That gave us huge insights 
into the business side of information 
security, as well as an understanding 
of how our employees use confidential 
data. It also enabled us to determine 
specific levels of protection, and to 
understand areas in which we can be 
more lenient and areas in which we 
should be more strict.

Many of our survey respondents have 
not yet taken these steps, however: 
Only 54% have a program to identify 
sensitive assets, and just 56% have 
taken the effort to inventory the 
collection, transmission, and storage 
of sensitive data for employees  
and customers. This type of strategic 
approach to spending is most common 
among aerospace and defense, 
technology, telecommunications, and 
financial services organizations. 

Regionally, respondents from South 
America and Asia Pacific are more 
likely to allocate security spending 
to their most valuable data. It is also 
essential that organizations align 
their security strategy with specific 
business needs, a step that 40% 
of respondents forgo. Industries 
most likely to link security and 
business strategies include industrial 
products, healthcare providers 
and payers, and financial services. 
Regionally, respondents from Asia 
Pacific and North America lead in 
this approach.

Another fundamental step is aligning security spending with the organizations 
strategic assets. Yet 34% of respondents do not allocate security spending to 
their most profitable lines of business.

33

Managing cyber risks in an interconnected world: Key findings from The Global State of Information Security Survey 2015Strategic security spending also will 
demand that businesses identify 
and invest in cybersecurity practices 
that are most relevant to todays 
advanced attacks. It is essential to 
fund processes that fully integrate 
predictive, preventive, detective,  
and incident-response capabilities  
to minimize the impact. 

Also critical is adequate investment 
in the people and process capabilities 
that allow businesses to rapidly 
respond to and mitigate incidents. 
Cybersecurity attorney Sotto says 
many of her clients are taking steps 
to improve response and mitigation.
It will also be necessary to ensure 
adequate funding for comprehensive, 
ongoing employee training and 
awareness programs. The US 
State of Cybercrime Survey clearly 
demonstrated the merit of security 
awareness programs. 

Businesses that have 
security awareness report 
significantly lower average 
financial losses from 
cybersecurity incidents. 

And the savings can be significant: 
We found companies that do not 
have security training for new hires 
reported annual financial losses that 
are four times greater than those  
that do have training.45

Effective security also will require  
a certain amount of knowledge about 
existing and potential adversaries, 
including their motives, resources, 
and methods of attack. This will not  
happen without a budget for threat 
analysis and monitoring, as well as  
a commitment of time and resources  
for collaborating with government 
agencies, peers, law enforcement, and  
other third parties to gain understanding  
of leading cybersecurity practices. In  
the current environment of proliferating  
threats, risk-based security practices 
should be a primary component of an 
organizations overall enterprise risk-
management framework.

We have been approached many 
times since December to help 
companies develop together proactive 
programs to minimize the impact of 
a cyber attack should it happen, says 
Lisa Sotto, cybersecurity attorney. 
Previously, that kind of proactive 
preparation was much more sparse.

While a well-designed cyber-risk 
management program will not 
totally eliminate risk, it can enable 
organizations to manage threats 
through an informed decision-
making process, increase efficiencies 
in security practices, and create a 
more resilient security practice. 

In the coming years, we believe that 
advances in computer science will 
help organizations better manage 
the risks and repercussions of cyber 
threats. Technology breakthroughs 
will likely help organizations reduce 
the complexity of cybersecurity, more 
quickly detect and remediate incidents, 
and improve their abilities to monitor 
and analyze digital activity. Until then, 
it is imperative that organizations, large 
and small, commit to understanding 
and managing the cybersecurity 
risks that have become top of mind 
for executive leaders, boards, and 
consumers across the globe.
