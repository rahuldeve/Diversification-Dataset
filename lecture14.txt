Graphs

A graph G consists of a set of vertices V together with
a set E of vertex pairs or edges.
Graphs are important because any binary relation is a
graph, so graph can be used to represent essentially
any relationship.
Example: A network of roads, with cities as vertices
and roads between cities as edges.
Stony Brook

Green Port
Orient Point

vertices - cities
Riverhead
edges - roads
Shelter Island

Montauk
Islip

Sag Harbor

Example: An electronic circuit, with junctions as vertices as components as edges.
vertices: junctions
edges: components

To understand many problems, we must think of them
in terms of graphs!

The Friendship Graph

Consider a graph where the vertices are people, and
there is an edge between two people if and only if they
are friends.

Frank Sinatra

George Bush

Nancy Reagan

Saddam Hussain

This graph is well-dened on any set of people: SUNY
SB, New York, or the world.
What questions might we ask about the friendship
graph?
 If I am your friend, does that mean you are

my friend?

A graph is undirected if (x y) implies (y x). Otherwise the graph is directed. The \heard-of" graph
is directed since countless famous people have never
heared of me! The \had-sex-with" graph is presumably undirected, since it requires a partner.
 Am I my own friend?
An edge of the form (x x) is said to be a loop.
If x is y's friend several times over, that could be
modeled using multiedges, multiple edges between
the same pair of vertices. A graph is said to be
simple if it contains no loops and multiple edges.

 Am I linked by some chain of friends to the

President?

A path is a sequence of edges connecting two vertices. Since Mel Brooks is my father's-sister'shusband's cousin, there is a path between me and
him!

Aunt Eve

Uncle Lenny

Cousin Mel

 How close is my link to the President?
If I were trying to impress you with how tight I
am with Mel Brooks, I would be much better o
saying that Uncle Lenny knows him than to go into
the details of how connected I am to Uncle Lenny.
Thus we are often interested in the shortest path
between two nodes.
 Is there a path of friends between any two

people?

A graph is connected if there is a path between
any two vertices. A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path between any two
vertices.
 Who has the most friends?
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges
adjacent to it.

 What is the largest clique?
A social clique is a group of mutual friends who all
hang around together. A graph theoretic clique is
a complete subgraph, where each vertex pair has
an edge between them. Cliques are the densest
possible subgraphs. Within the friendship graph,
we would expect that large cliques correspond to
workplaces, neighborhoods, religious organizations,
schools, and the like.
 How long will it take for my gossip to get back

to me?

A cycle is a path where the last vertex is adjacent
to the rst. A cycle in which no vertex repeats
(such as 1-2-3-1 verus 1-2-3-2-1) is said to be
simple. The shortest cycle in the graph denes its
girth, while a simple cycle which passes through
each vertex is said to be a Hamiltonian cycle.

Data Structures for Graphs

There are two main data structures used to represent
graphs.

Adjacency Matrices
An adjacency matrix is an n  n matrix, where M i j ] =
0 i there is no edge from vertex i to vertex j

It takes (1) time to test if edge (i j ) is in a graph
represented by an adjacency matrix.
Can we save space if (1) the graph is undirected? (2)
if the graph is sparse?

Adjacency Lists
An adjacency list consists of a Nx1 array of pointers,
where the ith element points to a linked list of the
edges incident on vertex i.

To test if edge (i j ) is in the graph, we search the ith
list for j , which takes O(d ), where d is the degree of
the ith vertex.
Note that d can be much less than n when the graph
is sparse. If necessory, the two copies of each edge can
be linked by a pointer to facilitate deletions.

Tradeo s Between Adjacency
Lists and Adjacency Matrices
Comparison
Winner
Faster to test if (x y) exists?
matrices
Faster to nd vertex degree?
lists
Less memory on small graphs? lists (m + n) vs. (n2)
Less memory on big graphs?
matrices (small win)
Edge insertion or deletion?
matrices O(1)
Faster to traverse the graph?
lists m + n vs. n2
Better for most problems?
lists
Both representations are very useful and have dierent
properties, although adjacency lists are probably better
for most problems.
