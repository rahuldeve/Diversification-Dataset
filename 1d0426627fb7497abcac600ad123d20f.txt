Topic: Effects of Amplification on Quality of Life Among School Age Children with Single Sided 
Deafness 

Clinical Question 

P:  Among school age children with single sided deafness 
I:  does amplification bone conduction hearing aids  
C: versus no amplification 
O: improve quality of life (QoL) 

 
Definitions:  
Amplification: 
For the purpose of this study, amplification is defined as:  Contralateral routing of Signal (CROS), bone 
anchored hearing aid (BAHA), bone conduction hearing aids (Transcranial aid). 
. 
Quality of Life: 
For the purpose of this project, QoL is defined as the core dimensions of); physical functioning, emotional 
functioning, social functioning, and school functioning.   
 
Other important indicators of QoL in the pediatric population with SSD include hearing in noise, localization, ease of 
listening and communicating, communication intent and behavior, nature of interpersonal relationships and 
involvement in recreational activities. 

  

Target Population  

  School age children (ages 7-18 years) with single sided deafness.   
  Children with additional learning disabilities are excluded. 

Recommendation  

It is recommended that for children with single sided deafness (SSD) amplification be offered (Hol, 
2010 [3b], Christensen, 2010 [4a], House 2010 [3a]). 
Note 1: Selected educational and family outcomes are important to monitor when amplification is 
used or if a decision is made not to provide amplification (McKay 2010 [5a]).   
Note 2: Utilize Quality of Life measurements with any child identified with SSD and their families 
(Borton 2010 [3a]). 
 Note 3: Educate parents/families and the child on the impact of single sided deafness regarding the 
potential effects of the hearing loss, current amplification options, costs, and realistic expectations 
about the devices may increase their ability to make informed an decision regarding interventions 
(Borton, 2010 [3a], McKay 2010 [5a]).

Discussion/summary of evidence 
 
A review of the current literature suggests that amplification versus no amplification improves quality of life 
and therefore offered as a part of care (House, 2010 [4b], Hol, 2009 [3b], Yuen, 2009 [3a], Linstrom 2009 
[3a], Christensen, 2010, [4a]).  Two of the most commonly reported challenges for patients with SSD are 
the ability to localize sound and speech understanding in noise (Bess, 1986 [5a]).  Therefore, most research 
studies have been designed to measure benefit with amplification in these two conditions, and failed to 
consistently show improvement in both (Hol, 2009 [3b], Hol, 2005 [3a], Linstrom, 2009 [3a]).  Quality of 
life measures for adults, however, have consistently shown benefit in the following conditions: listening in 
background noise, ease of communication and listening in reverberant conditions (House, 2010 [4b], Hol, 
2009 [3b], Yuen, 2009 [3a], Newman, 2008 [3b], Linstrom, 2009 [3a]). The studies evaluating children 
with SSD (Christensen, 2010 [4a], Christensen, 2008, [4b]) as well as studies involving children with 
unilateral hearing loss (UHL), (Borton, 2008 [3a], Wendorf, 2010, [3a]) suggest that functional outcome 
measures such as the CHILD, LIFE and a questionnaire by McKay (2002), indicate improvement in quality 
of life with amplification.  These findings suggest that more consistent test protocols utilizing quality of life 
measures are necessary to gather information on the effects of amplification for children with SSD. 
 

Health Benefits, Side Effects and Risks  
The primary risk of amplification is dependent upon the amplification device chosen.  Amplification options 
are divided into surgical and nonsurgical options.   
 
The most common surgical option is the Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) which includes the general 
risks involved in surgical procedures, such as anesthesia and infection as well as the potential failure of the 
device to integrate with the bone.  Another consideration is the high cost of the surgical procedure compared 
to the outcome benefits.  The appearance of the device has also been a concern reported by some patients. 
 
The nonsurgical options include cross routing of signal hearing aids (CROS aids) and bone conduction 
hearing aids (the TransEar and Transcranial CROS in-the-ear hearing aids).  The cost of the device is a 
consideration as most hearing aids are not covered by insurance companies.  The appearance of these 
devices has also been expressed as a concern by some patients and their parents. 
 
Common to all amplification devices is the time and effort to manage the hearing devices and the possibility 
that some children may have difficulty appropriately managing their devices, depending on their dexterity 
and developmental skills.

Background Information 
 
Children identified with single sided deafness (SSD) are frequently not offered amplification due to limited 
treatment options and unknown benefits (Kiese-Himmiel, C., 2002[4a], McKay 2008 [4a]).  The difficulties 
children experience with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) are described in the literature but there is limited 
evidence to support the benefit of amplification for SSD, especially with the pediatric population.  Current 
amplification options are inconsistently offered by audiologists (McKay, 2008 [5a], McKay 2010 [5a]).  
This project was developed to discover the evidence around the quality of life benefits for children with 
SSD fit with amplification.
