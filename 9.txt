DEFORESTATION
In the previous lessons you have learnt about environment, its components and various
ecological concepts. You have also acquainted yourself with natural ecosystem and manmade ecosystems. Humans have altered the ecosystems according to their own needs
without thinking about the consequences. Their need combined with greed have caused
much damage to the environment, which will affect the coming generations. The expansion
of agriculture, urbanization and industrialization needed the land which was obtained by
large scale clearing of forests. The deforestation has changed the scenario of developed
and developing countries, and has brought out vast changes resulting into a various
environmental problems. In this lesson you are going to study about deforestation, its
causes and effect on environment.

9.1 FORESTS

Notes

Forests are ecological as well as a socio-economic resource. Forests have to be managed
judiciously not only because they are source of various products and industrial raw materials
but also for environmental protection and various services they provide.
Approximately 1/3rd of the earth’s total land area is covered by forests. The forests provide
habitat for wildlife, resources such as timber, fire wood, drugs etc. and aesthetic environment.
Indirectly, the forests benefit people by protecting watersheds from soil erosion, keeping
rivers and reservoirs free of silt, and facilitate the recharging of groundwater. Forest plays
an important role in the cycling of carbon, water, nitrogen and other elements.
What is forest? Forest is a complex ecosystem consisting mainly of trees that
support a myriad forms of life. The trees are the most important component that help to
create a unique environment which, in turn, supports various kinds of animals and plants.
Trees are the prime producers for the forest, purify and cool the air and control the climate.
Forests may be subdivided into natural forests and plantations or man made forests. Natural
forests are forests composed of mainly naturally grown indigenous (local) trees while
plantations are forests established by growing trees by humans.
Climate, soil type, topography, and elevation are the main factors that determine the type
of forest. Forests are classified according to their nature and composition, the type of
climate in which they thrive, and its relationship with the surrounding environment. India
has a many types of forests: They range from rain forest of Kerala and North-East to
deciduous forests in the plains, mountain forests to alpine pastures of Ladakh and deserts
of Rajasthan.
9.1.1 Types of Forests
You have already studied the details of the major types of forests in India in
lesson- 6.(Recall Fig.6.2 of lesson-6)
9.1.2 Importance of Forests
Early life of humans on this planet began as forest dweller. In early days human were totally
dependent on forest for food, clothing, and shelter. Even after agriculture was started
humans remained dependent upon the forests for several of their needs. The source of fuel
wood and provide raw materials to various wood industries. Indian forests also provide
many other valuable minor products such as essential oil, medicinal plants, resins, turpentine
etc. Forests are renewable resources which provide a wide variety of commodities. Forests
satisfying aesthetic needs of humans and have been a source of inspiration for the
development of culture and civilization. Forests are home to a very large variety of plants,
animals and micro-organisms. This great richness of flora and fauna which has evolved

146

MODULE - 3

over the years is an important part of nature. Forests provide habitat and food as well as
protection to wildlife species against extremes of climate.
Forests have great biological importance as reservoirs of genetic diversity apart from
playing an important role in regulating earth’s climate.

Forest carry out many important vital functions given in the following tables.
Table 9.1: Main functions of the forests
Functions

Benefits

Productive functions

Production of various types of wood, fruits and a wide
range of compounds such as resins, alkaloids, essential
oil, latex and pharmaceutical substances.

Protective functions

Provides habitats for various organisms conservation of
soil and water, prevention of drought, shelter against
wind, cold, radiation, noise, sounds, smells and sights.

Regulative functions

Absorption, storage and release of gases (most
importantly carbon dioxide and oxygen), water,
minerals, elements and radiant energy. All such
functions improve the atmospheric and temperature
conditions and enhances the economic and
environmental value of the land .Forests also effectively
regulate floods and drought and all the biogeochemical
cycles.

• Timber
India and other tropical countries have particularly abundant timber and heartwood
resources. Timber accounts for 25% of all photosynthetic materials produced on the earth
and about half of the total biomass produced by a forest. A large number of trees are
commercially exploited for timber in different parts of India. Timber-based industries include
plywood manufacture, saw milling, paper and pulp, composite wood, matches, man-made
fibres, furniture, sports goods, and particle boards.
• Medicinal plants
About 40% of all the drugs used throughout the world have active ingredients extracted
from plants and animals. Drugs which are derived from natural compounds amount to at
least $40 billion worldwide sales annually. For example quinine is used to treat malaria
(from the cinchona tree); Digitalis is used to treat chronic heart trouble (from the foxglove
plant, Cinchona officinalis); and morphine and cocaine are used to reduce pain;drug for
leukemia from Vinca rosea, taxol from Taxus brevifolia etc; and hundreds of life saving
antibiotics. In recent years more than 5000 species of flowering plants have been analysed
by scientists for the presence of valuable drugs.

9.2 DEFORESTATION
Deforestation is a very broad term, which consists of cutting of trees including repeated
lopping, felling, and removal of forest litter, browsing, grazing and trampling of seedlings. It
can also be defined as the removal or damage of vegetation in a forest to the extent that it
no longer supports its natural flora and fauna.
The rapid rate of deforestation in the tropics is a key driving force in the yearly
increase of flood disasters.
Deforestation refers to the loss of tree cover; land that is permanently converted from
forest to non-forest uses such as agricultural pasture, desert, and human settlement.
In the beginning of 20th century about 7.0 billion hectares of forests were present over the
land of our planet and by 1950 forest covers was reduced to about 4.8 billon. If the
present trend continues forests will be reduced to only 2.35 billion ha hectares in 2000 A.D.
In a FAQ/UNEP study it was found that about 7.3 million hectares of rich tropical forests
every year and about 14 hectare of closed forest every minute are lost.

9.2.1 Extent of forest loss in India
India is an agricultural country. The country is losing its forest cover steadily because of
clearing forests of is done for agricultural purpose, cattle grazing and plantation crops such
as tea, coffee etc.
Deforestation is one of the most serious and widespread environmental problems which
India is facing. In India surveys conducted in early seventies and found a forest cover of
about 22.7%only instead of 33% considered desirable according to “National. Forest
Policy”.

Soon after independence, rapid development and progress saw large forest tracts
fragmented by roads, canals, and townships. There was an increase in the exploitation of
forest wealth. In 1950 the Government of India began the annual festival of tree planting
called the Vanamahotsava. Gujarat was the first state to implement it. However, it was
only in the 1970s that greater impetus was given to the conservation of India’s forests and
wildlife. India was one of the first countries in the world to have introduced a social forestry
programme to introduce trees in non-forested areas along road sides, canals, and railway
lines.

9.3 CAUSES OF DEFORESTATION
The most common reason for deforestation is cutting of wood for fuel, lumber and paper.
Another important cause relates to the clearing of forest land for agriculture, including
conversion to crop land and pasture (Fig. 9.2).

•

other causes.

Notes

(1) Agriculture
The expanding agriculture is one of the most important causes of deforestation. Man has
always modified the natural ecosystems in such a way that environment becomes more
favourable for crop growth whether using traditional or modern methods of agriculture. As
demands for agricultural products rises, more and more land is brought under cultivation
and for that more forests are cleared, grasslands and even marshes, and lands under water
are reclaimed. Thus there is much more ecological destruction than gain in term of crop
yield. The forest soil after clearing are unable to support farming for long periods due to
exhaustion of nutrients. Once the soils become unfit for cultivation, the area suffers from to
soil erosion and degradation.
(2) Shifting cultivation
Hunting and gathering has been the main form of sustenance practiced in the earlier periods
of human history. Shifting cultivation or Jhoom farming is a 12000-year old practice and a
step towards transition from food collection to food production. It is also known as slashuse (inAnnually

the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura and Andaman
and Nicobar Islands.
(3) Demand for firewood
Firewood has been used as a source of energy for cooking, heating etc. Almost 44% of
the total global wood produced fulfils the fuel requirements of the world. Close look at the
pattern of utilization of wood produced will show that the developed countries utilize 16%
of their share for fuel requirements. India consumes nearly 135-170 Mt (Million tonnes) of
firewood annually and 10-15 ha of forest cover is being stripped off to meet the minimum
fuel needs of urban and rural poor.

(4) Wood for industry and commercial use
Wood, the versatile forest produce, is used for several industrial purposes, such as making
crates, packing cases, furniture, match boxes, wooden boxes, paper and pulp, plywood,
etc. 1.24 lakh ha of forest have been cut for various industrial uses. Unrestricted exploitation
of timber as well as other wood products for commercial purposes is the main cause of
forest degradation. The paper industry accounts for about 2% of country’s annual
consumption of wood and 51% this requirement is met by bamboo wood. This has led to
the depletion of bamboo stocks in most of the peninsular India. For example the apple
industry in the Himalayan region has led to the destruction of fir and other tree species, for
making wooden boxes used for transporting apples. Similarly, plywood crates were used
for packing particularly tea and other produce.
(5) Urbanisation and developmental projects
Often urbanisation and developmental activities lead to deforestation. The process of
deforestation begins with building of infrastructure in the form of roads, railway lines,
building of dams, townships, electric supply etc. Thermal power plants, mining for coal,
metal ores and minerals are also important causes of deforestation.
Nowadays you must have heard about the Tehri power project which is a 260.5m high
earth and rock fill dam near the Tehri town in Garhwal Himalayas. The project site is
situated a little downstream the junction of Bhagirathi and Bhilganga rivers. An estimated
4,600 ha of good forest land will be submerged under water. This has displaced an estimated
3,500 odd families.
(6) Other causes
Recent developments everywhere in world have caused large scale environmental
degradation, especially in tropical forest areas. The large amounts of resources –living and
nonliving (minerals, river, land) found in these forests have attracted both industry and
other developmental agencies, which have severely depleted forest cover.
Forests may sometimes suffer from natural calamities such as overgrazing, floods, forest
fires, diseases and termite attack.

9.4 FORESTS AND TRIBAL SOCIETY
About 4% the world’s population lives in special territories .These indigenous or tribal
people have claims on a particular place; they have cultural, spiritual and economic ties
with the particular area and in most cases they have ability to manage the area and sustain
it. In this way they protect the biodiversity of that particular area and the local culture,
including knowledge and resource-management skills of the local community.
152

Deforestation
For example, the tribal people knew the agricultural practices which were ecologically
sound and these were passed from generation to generation for many centuries. They
knew how to grow different kinds of food and fibre crops simultaneously on the same
plots and keep the land productive for several years in a row, and then plots were left to
recover for several years to grow back into forests, before clearing the area again to begin
the cycle afresh.

9.5 CONSEQUENCES OF DEFORESTATION
Deforestation affects both physical and biological components of the environment.
•

Soil erosion and flash flood

•

Climatic change

•

Loss of biodiversity

(1) Soil erosion and flash flood
A shrinking forest cover coupled with over exploitation of ground water has accelerated
erosion along the slopes of the lower Himalayas and Aravali hills, making them prone to
153

MODULE - 3

Environment

Notes

landslides. Destruction of the forests has altered rainfall pattern. In 1978 India suffered
some of the worst flooding in its history. There was two days of heavy rainfall and 66,000
villages were inundated, 2,000 people drowned, and 40,000 cattle were swept away. In
2008 Bihar state suffered worst flood in the river kosi. Several lives were lost and a huge
number of cattle were swept away. Lack of forest cover has resulted in water flowing off
the ground, washing away the top soil which is finally deposited as silt in the river beds.
Forests check soil-erosion, landslides and reduce intensity of flood and drought.
The loss of top soil is in India, is 18.5% of the global soil loss. This is indeed very
serious, considering the fact that India has only 2.4% of the land area of the world.
(2) Climatic change
Forests enhance local precipitation and improve water holding capacity of soil, regulate
water cycle, maintain soil fertility by returning the nutrients to the soil through leaf fall and
decomposition of litter. Forests check soil-erosion, landslides and reduce intensity of flood
and droughts. Forests, being home of wildlife are important assets of aesthetic, touristic
and cultural value to the society.
Forests have profound effect on the climate. Forest absorbed carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and help in balancing carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere. The
forests play a vital role in maintaining oxygen supply in the air, we breathe. They also play
a vital role in the regulation of water (water cycle) in the environment and act as environmental
buffers regulating climate and atmospheric humidity.
Heat build-up in the atmosphere is one of the important problems of the century known as
green house effect is the partly caused by the result from deforestation. The entire
Himalayan ecosystem is threatened and is under severe imbalance as snow –line has thinned
and perennial springs have dried up. Annual rainfall has declined by 3 to 4%. Chronic
droughts have begun even in areas like Tamilnadu and Himanchal Pradesh where they
were not known earlier.
(3) Biodiversity
“Biodiversity” include all variety of life forms. Biodiversity - (biological diversity) is a
measure of variation, the number of different varieties, among living things. Biodiversity
can be expressed in number of ways, which includes the number of genetic strains
(differences) within species and the number of different ecosystem in an area. The most
common expression of biodiversity is the number of different species, within a particular
area (local biodiversity), or in a specific habitat (habitat biodiversity) or in the world (global
biodiversity). Biodiversity is not static. It changes over the time during evolution new species
have come up while some species become extinct.
Our knowledge is incomplete at the global level; nearly 1.4 million species have been
identified. Different species inhabiting the earth have been estimated to vary between 10

154

MODULE - 3

Deforestation
and 100 million. There is lot of concern about preserving biodiversity. You will study more
about biodiversity conservation in lesson 15. The one good reason for preserving
biodiversity is that it provides wide variety of products for human use and welfare. It is a
great potential resource for agriculture, medicine and industry.
There are several causes for biodiversity loss:•

hunting, poaching and commercial exploitation.

•

elimination and disturbance of wildlife habitats.

•

selective destruction of habitat/ life forms.

•

domestication.

•

introduction of new alian species in new area which threaten the indigenous species.

•

use of pesticides.

•

pests, medical research and zoos.

Human Impact on
Environment

Notes

All the above factors adversely affect biodiversity.
9.5.1 Extinct species
Ultimate fate of every species is extinction but after industrialization this rate has increased
tremendously. The extinct species only exist in museums and photographs. The most noted
example of extinct species is passenger pigeon.
• Threatened species
Several plant and animal species are threatened by the possibility of being on the verge of
extinction but the seriousness of this threat varies. International Union of Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) has categorized threatened species into four categories which are:
(i) Endangered

A species is considered endangered when its numbers are few and
its homeland is very small, or both and if special protection is not
given it may become extinct .for example the lion –tailed monkey
from rain forests and Sholas of south India.

(ii) Rare

These are those species whose number is few or they live in such
small areas or such unusual environment (endemics), that they could
quickly disappear.The Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps )
is an example of rare species of India. (Fig. 9.3)

(iii) Depleted

These are the species whose numbers are greatly reduced from
those of the recent past, and they are continuing to decrease. It is
the continued decrease, which is the main cause of concern. Animals/
plant in this category can quickly change to a rare or endangered
category. In the past few years, the fur of the clouded leopard
(Neofelis nebulosa) was sold illegally in Kashmir markets.
155

MODULE - 3

Notes

Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course
(iv) Indeterminate Those species that seem to be in danger of extinction but their true
information regarding their status is not known are the indeterminate
species. The snow leopard (Leo uncia) was classified as
indeterminate species in 1968, and was declared endangered in
1970. You probably know that the snow leopard is hunted for its
thick beautiful fur.

Fig. 9.3: Great Indian bustard
9.5.2 Loss of wild life
Over the past 2000 years, 600 species of animals have become extinct or are going to be
extinct from the earth. Similarly, about 3000 species of plants need to be conserved. The
shrinkage of green cover has adverse effects on the stability of the ecosystem. Poaching is
another factor causing depletion of wildlife. The roll call of victims is endless. In Africa, in
recent years, nearly 95 per cent of the black rhino population has been exterminated by
poachers for their horns and over one third of Africa’s elephants have been wiped out for
ivory. The scarlet macaw once common throughout South America has been eliminated
from most of its range in Central America. Several species of spotted cats such as the
ocelot and jaguar are in danger of extinction due to demand of their fur.
9.5.3 Loss of wildlife in India
India has nearly 45,000 species of plants and 75,000 species of animals. This biological
diversity ought to be preserved for maintaining stability of ecosystems. Deforestation coupled
with desertification has destroyed the natural treasure of the earth to a large extent.
The population of elephant, lion and tiger is fast diminishing. ‘Cheetah’ is already extinct.
Elephants once found all over India have now disappeared from Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh and Maharashtra. The Asiatic lion which was very common in Asia has practically
vanished from Asia except for a few hundred sq km (square kilometer) of Gir forest in
India.
In India four species of mammals and three species of birds have been extinct in the last
100 years. Another 40 species of mammals, 20 species of birds and 12 species of reptiles
are considered highly endangered due to overexploitations, of forests.

9.6 DESERTIFICATION
What is desertification? It can be defined as ‘the diminution or destruction of the
biological potential of the land which can ultimately lead to desert like conditions’.
The arid and semi-arid areas where climate is dry, restoration is very slow, mining and
overgrazing etc. adds to several other desertification pressures. Desertification is a systemic
phenomenon resulting from excessive felling of trees which manifests itself in the loss of soil
fertility, high wind velocity, low precipitation, increasing aridity and extremes of temperatures
in the affected area.(Fig.9.4)

Notes

Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course
Desert supports very little of vegetation and animals which are especially adapted to
extremely unfavorable conditions. Although desertification can develop from natural causes
alone, in a majority of instances human intervention promoted arid conditions in an already
dry areas. This can happen in any climatic zone or ecosystem, resulting from exploitative
interaction of man with the natural ecosystem. Most of the deserts of recent origin have
resulted form any one or more of the following human activities.
(i) Uncontrolled and overexploitation of grazing land, indiscriminate cutting of trees and
forest resources leading to drought, soil erosion, deterioration of soil fertility which
results in stunted plant growth.
(ii) Excessive mining in arid and semi-arid regions for extraction of minerals, coal or
limestone resulting in loss of trees, and green cover, and leading to total destruction of
conditions conducive to vegetation growing.
(iii) Uneconomic land use for agriculture by cultivation on marginal lands affecting adjacent
fertile lands and causing soil erosion.
(iv) Intensive and uneconomic exploitation of water resources leading to fall in water table,
seepage and problems of excessive salinisation of soil.
Table 9.4: Extent and causes of land degradation of the world
Area

Causes of land degradation

580 million ha Deforestation -- Vast reserves of forests have been degraded by
large scale logging and clearance for farm and urban use. More than
200 million ha of tropical forests were destroyed mainly for food
production.
680 million ha Overgrazing – About 20% of the world’s pasture and range lands
have been damaged. Recent losses have been most severe in Africa
and Asia.
137 million ha Fuel wood consumption – About 1730 million m3 of fuel wood are
harvested annually from forests and plantations. Wood fuel is the primary
source of energy in many developing regions.
550 million ha Agricultural mismanagement – Loss of soil due to water erosion is
estimated at 25,000 million tonnes annually. Soil salinization, water
logging, chemical degradation and desertification affect about 40 million
ha of land globally.
19.5 million ha Industrialization and urbanization – Urban growth, road
construction, mining and industry are major factors in land degradation
in different regions. Valuable agricultural land is often lost.

Deforestation
9.6.1 Extent of desertification
About 76.15% of the total Indian desert area has resulted from manmade desertification
process. Another 19.5% of the total area is subjected to medium or slight desertification.
This area is concentrated mostly along the eastern Rajasthan in the north-east to southwest zone parallel to the foothills of Aravalis.

MODULE - 3
Human Impact on
Environment

Notes

Most of the deserts, in India are found in the states of Rajasthan and Western Gujarat,
where about 23.8 mha area has been affected by desertification. About 4.34% of this area
lies in the extreme West of Rajasthan in Jaisalmer district. This desert is concentrated
along a belt in Ganganagar, Churu, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Jhunjhunu
and Nagaur districts. The predominant processes of desertification in this belt are the
expansion of sand cover and shifting sand dunes by wind erosion.
Natural desertification
In the Asia and pacific region an area of about 4.361 lakhs ha has resulted from
natural desertification. These areas can be classified as subtropical, cool coastal,
rain shadow and interior continental deserts. Besides these, Polar regions of the
world also represent a type of desert, where water is no doubt present in plenty, but
being in the form of ice, it is not available for plants and animals. The Gobi desert of
north western Asia is a cold desert. The Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir
covering an area of 0.7 lakh sq. km. and located at an altitude of about 11,000 feet
where extreme cold conditions prevail for about 5-6 months in a year, is also a cold
desert.
9.6.2 Thar Desert—A case study
The Thar Desert exhibited spectacular biological diversity because of its evolutionary history
and geographical location. This is a extensive region of sandy desert in northwestern India
and eastern Pakistan. The Thar Desert is about 805 km long and about 485 km wide.
Rainfall is sparse averaging from 127 to 254 mm annually and temperature rises as high as
52.8oC in July.
(i) Plants
Ecologically, vegetation of the major part of Thar Desert region falls under the category of
‘thorn forest type’. However, the natural vegetation cover has become progressively
transformed due to prolonged and intense human interference. Nevertheless, natural
vegetation makes a substantial contribution to the productivity of trees like Khejri which
are highly valued and conscientiously maintained. There are as many as 700 species of
plants amongst which grasses alone account for 107 species. Large-scale destruction of

159

MODULE - 3

Notes

Environmental Science Senior Secondary Course
natural vegetation from this part of the country is due to heavy pressure of overgrazing by
livestock, making regeneration of plants process in the desert very difficult.
Human activities and - more fundamental - underlying structural factors and material
processes in our society are causing species to vanish at a rate unequalled since the
doomsdays of the dinosaur. There’s no time to waste. We must protect biodiversity now,
for our next generation.
(ii) Animals
Thar desert is fascinating. The Asiatic lion, used to inhabit the plains of Rajasthan, Punjab
and Sind in the recent past. It is on record that the last lions occurring in the desert were
shot during 1976. The cheetah now extinct in India was at one time found in the Kathiawad
region. Similarly, leopards and caracal lynx, the wild boar, wild ass, Asiatic wolf, etc. have
also met the same fate. Among other mammalian fauna, Indian gazelle, blue bull and black
buck are also in the list of endangered animal species.
Predominant bird species are also very scanty, particularly in sandy habitats of western
Rajasthan. The great Indian bustard, houbara, and lesser florican populations in the Thar
Desert are dwindling as compared to that in the recent past. Pea-fowl, being a national
bird, is well protected by people.
Among reptiles, two species of crocodiles and turtles are now restricted to Jawai-dam in
Sirohi district at the foot hills of Aravali. The large terrestrial reptile, the rock python found
on the foothills of Aravali is also vanishing from the desert.
Thus, looking at the past history of Thar desert, a large number of animals are at the verge
of extinction and some .have vanished.

Deforestation

MODULE - 3
Human Impact on
Environment

WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT
•

Forests are the backbone of the life forms and the life on earth is sustained through
them.

•

There are three major functions of the forests i) productive functions .ii) protective
functions iii) regulative functions.

•

Timber and several models obtained from plants for medicine are still provided by
forests.

•

Tribal people totally depended on forests for food, shelter and clothing; in turn they
also conserve the forests.

•

Deforestation of forests is caused due to shifting cultivation, demand for timber, for
paper and pulp, commercial wood and fire wood, and mining operations.

•

Deforestation also causes soil erosion and floods, climatic changes, loss of wild life.

•

Loss of biodiversity during deforestation is immense because several unknown species
of biota is lost forever from our planet earth.

•

Extinct species are those that were unable to survive in the changed environment and
thus perished.

•

Threatened species are likely to become extinct if their environment deteriorates further,
endangered species are few in number and their homeland is very small and any
deterioration in environment can make them extinct.

•

Depleted species are those whose number have decreased in the recent years and are
continuing to decrease. Indeterminate species are those species whose status is not
known due to lack of information.

•

Desertification is a natural phenomenon but it is often accelerated by human activities.
they are uncontrolled grazing, indiscriminate cutting of forests, excessive mining,
uneconomic use of agriculture land, exploitation of water resources.

•

Deforestation and desertification are two interlinked problems which have arisen from
the overexploitation of natural resources through human activities causing irreparable
damage to earth.

Notes

3. Match the definition of words given in column A with column B
Column A

Column B

(a) Rare species

i)

A species is considered endangered when its numbers
are few and its homeland is very small, or both and if
special protection is not given it may become extinct

(b)Indeterminate species ii)

These are those species whose number is few or they live
in such small areas or such unusual environment
(endemics), that they could quickly disappear.

Notes

(c) Endangered species

iii) These are the species whose numbers are greatly reduced
from those of the recent past, and they are continuing to
decrease.

(d)Depleted species

iv) Those species that seem to be in danger.

4. Make a project on ‘habitat destruction and wild life loss’ by giving at least example of
five animal species and five plant species, try to give photograph/drawing of the species.
5. Make a list of extinct animal and plant species from India by going through various
books and magazine.
6. ‘The development projects have harmed the tribal society the most’ give your views
on the above given statement.
