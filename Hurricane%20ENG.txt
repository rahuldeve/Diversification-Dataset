Hurricane Safety Checklist

Hurricanes are strong storms
that cause life- and property-
threatening hazards such as
flooding, storm surge, high winds
and tornadoes.

Preparation is the best protection
against the dangers of a hurricane.

What should I do?

What supplies do I need?

What do I do after a hurricane?

J Listen to a NOAA Weather Radio for

critical information from the National
Weather Service (NWS).

J Check your disaster supplies and

replace or restock as needed.

J Bring in anything that can be picked up

by the wind (bicycles, lawn furniture).

J Close windows, doors and hurricane

shutters. If you do not have hurricane
shutters, close and board up all
windows and doors with plywood.

J Turn the refrigerator and freezer to the
coldest setting and keep them closed as
much as possible so that food will last
longer if the power goes out.

J Turn off propane tanks and unplug

small appliances.

J Fill your cars gas tank.

J Talk with members of your household

and create an evacuation plan.
Planning and practicing your
evacuation plan minimizes confusion
and fear during the event.

J Learn about your communitys

hurricane response plan. Plan routes to
local shelters, register family members
with special medical needs as required
and make plans for your pets to be
cared for.

J Evacuate if advised by authorities. Be

careful to avoid flooded roads and
washed out bridges.

J Because standard homeowners

insurance doesnt cover flooding, its
important to have protection from the
floods associated with hurricanes,
tropical storms, heavy rains and other
conditions that impact the U.S. For
more information on flood insurance,
please visit the National Flood
Insurance Program Web site at
www.FloodSmart.gov.
