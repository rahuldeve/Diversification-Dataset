HP Virtual Cloud Networking 
SDN application

The need for network agility

Cloud computing is increasingly attractive to 
businesses because of the agility, cost savings, 
and efficiency it provides. However, these same 
businesses are finding themselves limited by 
the complexity and disjointed architecture of 
legacy networks: not only are legacy networks 
complex, they are also slow to provision new 
services and are labor intensive. They do not 
have the agility to meet the challenges of 
The New Style of IT, characterized by the 
interrelated trends of cloud, security, mobility 
and Big Data.

In order to meet the constantly evolving 
needs of your customers, you need a network 
infrastructure that works with you, not against 
youone that not only is agile enough to 
deliver robust and scalable services, but 
also simple enough to lower costs and 
limit complexity.

Orchestrating a robust 
network 

 Complete access to an open SDN 

ecosystem that includes HP and third-party 
SDN applications

The HP Virtual Cloud Networking (VCN) SDN 
application can help you do just that. The 
HP VCN SDN application is the enhanced 
networking module of HP Helion OpenStack, 
delivering network virtualization enabled 
by Softwaredefined Networking (SDN) 
and orchestrating the entire datacenter 
infrastructure. 

The VCN SDN application helps cloud providers 
and enterprises build a robust multitenant 
networking infrastructure that is able to 
deliver ready-to-use compute, storage, and 
networking. It provides:

 Scalable, secure, and hardened enterprise 

cloud networking 

 Automated delivery of secure isolated 

networks in minutes 

 Unified physical and virtual control 

and visibility 

HP VCN SDN application 

The HP VCN SDN application integrates with 
the HP Virtual Application Networks (VAN) SDN 
controller and leverages OpenFlow to create a 
unified control for the deployment of dynamic 
policy on both the virtual (Open vSwitch) and 
physical (HP and third-party) networks.

VCN provides a multitenant network 
virtualization service for KVM and VMware 
ESX multihypervisor data center applications, 
offering organizations both open source as 
well as proprietary solutions. Multitenant 
isolation is provided by centrally orchestrated 
VLAN or VXLAN-based virtual networks, 
operating over standard L2 or L3 data center 
fabrics.

Fact sheet  |  HP Virtual Cloud Networking SDN application

Bare-metal (non-virtualized) servers 
and appliances can be supported in a  
VXLAN environment, with the addition of 
HP 5930 switches, to provide the hardware 
tunnel end-point function. In a fully virtualized 
deployment, the existing data center switching 
infrastructure can be retained without 
the need for costly upgrades. OpenFlow 
1.3enabled devices are recommended to 
realize the full benefit of SDNbased data 
center applications. 

HP VCN provides several enhancements to 
Neutron which are listed in the table. 

HP Intelligent Management 
Centersupporting 
networking virtualization 

The HP Intelligent Management Center (IMC) 
manages the traditional networking fabric in 
HP and heterogeneous environments, and has 
added support for networking virtualization. 
IMC offers singlepaneofglass management, 
allowing you to provision and monitor both 
physical and virtual networks, essential for 
non-cloud (OpenStack) deployments. For cloud 
deployments, IMC serves as the assurance 
monitoring solution for the network and 
applications in a VCN deployment.

Use the network to innovate

Open APIs enable HP and third-party 
developers to create innovative solutions 
for the management, provisioning, and 
orchestration of an OpenStack cloud. VCN 
maintains full API compatibility with the 
current OpenStack Icehouse release while 
implementing changes that dramatically 
enhance the performance, scalability, and 
stability of cloud network deployments.
