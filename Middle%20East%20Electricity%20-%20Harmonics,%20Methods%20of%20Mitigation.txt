Harmonics

Voltage supply impedance can cause havoc in power
systems. Unfortunately, many project contractors that

agree to abide by harmonic standards specified in

contracts often have very limited knowledge of

harmonics, their effects or the real cost of compliance.

Recommendations
To limit the magnitude of harmonics in
the electricity supply networks, various
countries  implement  harmonic  recom-
mendations. In North America, and to
a  major  degree  internationally,  IEEE
519 (1992) is the recognised standard
and is by far the most common specified
by  Middle  East  consultants,  followed
some  way  behind  by  UKs  new  G5/4
(2001).

IEEE 519 (1992) is easily understood;
the  maximum  harmonic  current  per-
missible  at  a  designated 
point  of
common coupling being related to the
short circuit capacity of the supply.

According  to  IEEE  519  (1992),
within an industrial plant, the PCC is
the  point  of  connection  between  the
non-linear  load(s)  and  other  loads.
This ensures that if IEEE 519 (1992) is
complied with there will be no damage
to,  or  adverse  effects  upon,  the  equip-
ment connected within that plant, and
the utility supply will be protected.

In comparison, the UKs G5/4 (2001)
is only concerned with protection of the
utility  supply  network,  not  consumer
plant and equipment. It is therefore not
surprising  that  IEEE  519  (1992)  is  a
more popular standard. 

IEEE  519  (1992)  defines  the  maxi-
mum  recommended  voltage  distortion
(VTHD) for general systems to be 5%
with no more than 3% of any individual
harmonic.  For 
special  applications
such  as  hospitals  and  airports  a  lower
limit of 3% applies. For dedicated sys-
tems  with  100%  converter  load  (i.e.,
no  non-linear  loads)  a  higher  limit  of
10% voltage distortion is permitted. 

In  IEEE  519  (1992)  the  permitted
current distortion varies with respect to
the system fault level and the total load
demand as illustrated below.

Unfortunately, in the authors experi-
ence  a  project  harmonic  standard  is
frequently  disregarded  if  the  costs  of
compliance are higher than anticipated
or  the  project  is  over  budget.  Many
contractors  agree  to  abide  by  the  har-
monic 
the
contract  but  often  have  very  limited
knowledge of harmonics, their effects or
the real cost of compliance.

The design of AC variable frequency
drives results in a pulsed current being
drawn from the supply containing har-
monic currents; refer to Fig 2 (6 pulse
rectifier,  PWM  VSD).  The 
Total
Harmonic Current Distortion (THID)
illustrated, 72.9%, is typical. In order to
attenuate  the  magnitude  of  these
pulsed  currents  drive  designers  often
install  inductors  in  either  the  AC  line
or in the DC bus of the drive, occasion-
ally  both.  The  reactance  values  vary
between 2% and 5% with 3% being the
norm, usually inserted in the AC line;
3% is the optimal value based on per-
formance and additional drive cost.

in 

An  issue  giving  increasing  cause  for
concern  in  the  region,  however,  is  the
harmonic distortion of voltage supplies
due  to  non-sinusoidal  currents  drawn
during  the  power  conversion  process
inside drive converters and other types
of electronic equipment. 

Harmonic  currents  cause  havoc  in
power  systems,  especially  with  genera-
tors,  such  as  those  found  on  remote
pumping stations and standby plant. 

These  are 

weak  sources  where
impedances  can  be  as  high  as  15-18%
compared  to 
stiff  sources  (5-6%),
more  common  in  utility  connections.
The weaker the source, the higher the
harmonic voltage distortion, for a given
harmonic  current  distortion.  Figure  1
illustrates  the  effect  of  excessive  har-
monic currents on a generator voltage
output. 

Typical effects of harmonic distortion

  Overheating  and  destruction  of

Danger  of  resonance  (i.e.,  voltage
amplification) if detuning reactors are
not fitted to the capacitor bank, causing
catastrophic  damage  to  capacitors  and
other equipment.

Other  more  advanced  solutions  to
ensure  compliance  with  IEEE  519
(1992)  include  AC  drives  with  active
front ends and active shunt filters, both
of which offer excellent harmonic miti-
gation  performance  (<5%  THID).
However, high cost, decreased efficien-
cy,  reduced  reliability  and  adverse
interaction with other equipment have
resulted to date, in these solutions not

problem 

In  reality,  it  is  impossible  to  comply
with  IEEE  519  (1992)  using  only  AC
line or DC bus reactors. Other methods
of mitigation are needed.

Traditionally,  drive  manufacturers
have used phase shift transformers and
modified  drives  to  provide  a  greater
level of harmonic attenuation, with 12
pulse being the most common; 18, 24,
36  and  even  48  pulse  designs  are  also
used on occasion. A 12 pulse drive con-
sists  of  2  x  6  pulse  input  rectifiers,

displaced by 30 electrical degrees, oper-
ating in parallel. The 30 degrees phase
shift  is  obtained  using  a  special  trans-
former  with  three  windings.  Due  to
differences  in  the  instantaneous  out-
puts  of  each  rectifier  an  inter-phase
reactor is usually required. 

Twelve pulse mitigation provide lev-
els of THID from ~15% for polygonal
autotransformers to 9-10% for the more
expensive double wound types (figure 2
12  pulse  VSD).  Their  use  however,
reduces the overall efficiencies of drive
systems, often by 4-5%, primarily due to
the  losses  of  the  transformers  under
harmonic loads.

In addition, the phase shifted limbs of
the transformers must be carefully bal-
anced  and  any  pre-existing  voltage
distortion  and  voltage  imbalance  must
be low otherwise the harmonic mitiga-

Compliance
If  guaranteed  compliance  with  IEEE
519 (1992) is required, and at reason-
able cost, there is another solution. The
LineatorTM,  a  patented  device  manu-
factured  by  Mirus  International  Inc.,
consists  of  a  series  connected  multiple
winding  input  line  reactor  and  small
capacitor bank which when applied to
virtually  any  6  pulse  AC  PWM  drive
results in a THID of between 5 to 8% at

load  operation  (figure  2 

The reduction in harmonic currents
is  achieved  through  patented  multiple
reactor winding design that creates an
output  voltage  waveform  shape  that
allows  the  drive  input  diodes  to  con-
duct  current  over  a  longer  time  span
and  with  a  substantially  lower  peak
value.  In  addition,  due  to  the  low
capacitive  reactance  (<15%  of  rated
kVA)  the  Lineator  is  still  compatible
with all forms of power generators. 

As  illustrated  in  figure  3,  unlike
multi-pulse  systems,  Lineator  an  be
applied to individual or multiple 6 pulse
AC  drives  between  3kW  (4HP)  and
2,500kW (3,350HP) and can be retro-
fitted to existing 6 pulse AC drives. Low
losses (>99% efficiency) result in over-
all  efficiencies  being  typically  3-4%
points  better  than  12  or  18  pulse
designs,  important  in,  for  example,
remote pumping stations supplied from
generators  where  the  cost  of  prime
mover fuel is high or where the wire to
water  efficiencies  must  be  as  high  as
possible to minimise running costs. 

Rugged  construction,  simple  design
and  inherent  reliability  coupled  with
excellent  harmonic  mitigation  perfor-
mance  and  high  efficiency  should
ensure  this  device  receives  serious
attention for all AC drive applications
alongside traditional methods.
