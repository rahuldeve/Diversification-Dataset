ExECutivE summary

Despite the lengthy debate on the federal budget in Congress, climate change 

rarely gets mentioned as a deficit driver. Yet paying for climate disruption 
was one of the largest non-defense discretionary budget items in 2012. 

Indeed, when all federal spending on last years droughts, storms, floods, and forest 
fires are added up, the U.S. Climate Disruption Budget was nearly $100 billion.

Heres a startling reality: Americas taxpayers paid three times what private insurers 

paid out to cover losses from extreme weather. 

Heres another: The federal government spent more taxpayer money on the 
consequences of 2012 extreme weather than on education or transportation. 
Climate doesnt show up as a line item in the budget, but what NRDC calls the Climate 
Disruption Budget for 2012 is equal to one out of every six dollars spent on non-defense 
discretionary programs, making it the number-one item in that part of the federal 
budget.

Overall, the insurance industry estimates that 2012 was 
the second-costliest year in U.S. history for climate-related 
disasters, with more than $139 billion in damages.1 But 
private insurers themselves covered only about 25 percent 
of these costs ($33 billion2), leaving the federal government 

and its public insurance enterprises to pay for the majority of 
the remaining claims. That reflects a major shift in liabilities 
with respect to climate change away from private insurers to 
public alternatives, a shift that began in earnest after the $72 
billion hit the industry took in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina.3

While it can be argued that some of these federal 

programssuch as forest fire prevention, crop insurance, 
flood coverage, and disaster preparedness and response 
do offer wider benefits to the country, it should be noted 
that these liabilities have largely been assumed by the public 
sector due to a lack of private-sector alternatives.

In sum, the U.S. government paid more than three times as 
much as private insurers paid for climate-related disasters in 
2012.

As a result, federal spending on the consequences of extreme 

weather made worse by climate change far exceeded total 
spending aimed at solving the problem. In fact, it was eight 
times the Environmental Protection Agencys total budget and 
eight times total spending on energy.4 

At nearly $100 billion, federal spending on the extreme 

energy

weather events in 2012 exceeded even the largest non-
defense discretionary super category used by the Office 
of Management and Budget to compile federal spending on 
general government functions across multiple departments 
and agencies, such as education, transportation, and housing 
(see Table 1).5 The climate disruption budget for 2012 
was equivalent to 16 percent of total federal non-defense 
discretionary spending.6

While the budget to pay for recovery from climate 

The approach includes an innovative provision that 

disruptions hit a record high in 2012 and is expected to 
continue to grow, the budget for programs to fight climate 
disruptionsuch as environmental enforcement, energy 
efficiency, clean energy vehicle research, and ARPA-E
suffered cuts of more than $100 million in the sequester  
that went into effect in March and remain under continued 
pressure from the budget-cutting process.7 And yet our 
nations climate plan is, in effect, to cut critical investments 
now for the sake of small, short-term deficit reductions and 
then send our children the tax bills to clean up the mess. 

Thats colossally shortsighted.

Fortunately, there is much that the president can do to fight 
climate change without waiting for the current Congress to 
act. NRDC has developed a groundbreaking plan to use the 
Clean Air Act to make big reductions in carbon pollution  
from power plants, Americas largest source of global 
warming pollution. Our analysis shows that the EPA can 
set fair and flexible standards that cut power plant carbon 
pollution by 26 percent by 2020 and 34 percent by 2025 
compared with 2005 levels.8

will drive investment in cost-effective energy efficiency, 
substantially reducing the cost of compliance, lowering 
electricity bills, and creating thousands of jobs across the 
country. Further, NRDCs analysis shows that the benefits 
in saved lives, reduced illnesses, and avoided climate 
changefar outweigh the costs, by as much as 15 times.

America can achieve its goal of reducing global warming 

pollution 17 percent by 2020 by curbing power plant 
pollution in combination with steps the administration 
has already taken, such as setting standards to cut carbon 
emissions from new cars in half by 2025,9 and other steps the 
president has authority to pursue, such as curbing emissions 
of methane and hydrofluorocarbons (which trap heat even 
more effectively than carbon dioxide).10 That means we dont 
have to just accept an ever-increasing Climate Disruption 
Budget that our children will have to pay for. We can fight 
back with a more forward-looking approach, starting now.

Federal Emergency management  
agency (FEma)
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
provides relief to states following a major disaster declaration 
by the president. Congress provides two sources of FEMA 
funding: 1) Enacted Appropriations, which cover costs 
associated with normal disasters where outlays are 
less than $500 million, and 2) Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations, which cover costs from all federal agencies 
involved in disaster relief in excess of $500 million.11

FEMA: Enacted Appropriations
Each year Congress provides funding to FEMA under the 
Disaster Relief Fund based on available funds, historical 
average disaster costs, outstanding recovery efforts, and 
possible fund reimbursements. On average, Congress 

authorized about $1.7 billion per year to pay for Enacted 
Appropriations through 2010, but this amount has risen 
substantially over the past two years to cover state-based 
programs and costs that exceeded the discretionary cap 
under the Budget Control Act.12

Emergency Supplemental Appropriations
Since 1989, Congress has passed emergency supplemental 
appropriations totaling in excess of $410 billion 2012 dollars, 
with more than $140 billion authorized over the past 10 years 
alone, largely due to the 2005 hurricane season ($55.9 billion) 
and Hurricane Sandy ($50.7 billion).13 

The funds from the Emergency Supplemental 

Appropriations are then allocated to the agencies involved 
in the recovery effort. In the case of Hurricanes Katrina, 
Rita, and Wilma, the Department of Homeland Security 
received 57 percent of emergency supplemental funds, 
followed by HUD (16 percent), DOD Army Corps of Engineers 
(13 percent), DOD (7 percent), and the Department of 
Transportation (3 percent).

National Flood insurance Program (NFiP)
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has nearly  
$1.3 trillion in policies outstanding.14 

The National Flood Insurance Program includes several 

state programs, such as the one for Florida (which has more 
than 2 million policyholders and a face value of $475 billion), 
that had to be folded into the program as the rising cost of 
flooding was not being covered by private insurers. 

The National Flood Insurance Program has nearly 

doubled in size from $692 billion to $1,293 billion over the 
past decade as private insurers have continued to shy away 
from making bets against Mother Nature when it comes to 
floods. And while the federal government has picked up the 
slack in terms of coverage, it has had a tough time balancing 
the premiums that are paid in with the heavy losses it has 
sustained from recent climate-related events.

GovErNmENt Costs rELatED  
to DrouGht
Federal Crop insurance Corporation (FCiC)
Overall, last years drought cost the United States an 
estimated $60 billion to $100 billion, likely rivaling Hurricane 
Sandy recovery, which cost taxpayers $60 billion. About $16 
billion of the drought-related costs were directly borne by 
U.S. taxpayers in the form of large federal crop insurance 
losses and higher government food purchase costs.15

Scientists will continue to debate the roles that climate 

change and natural variability played in last years drought. 
Both undoubtedly contributed, but with the concentration 
of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere rapidly approaching 
400 parts per millionmore than 40 percent above natural 
levelsits clear that the risks of severe droughts will 
continue to rise. Thats because the extra heat trapped by 
carbon dioxide, methane, and similar pollutants evaporates 
water faster during dry weather and also leads to more 
intense storms when its wet.16

When it comes to drought, the Federal Crop Insurance 
Corporation (FCIC), administered by the U.S. Department 
of Agricultures Risk Management Agency (RMA), ends up 
footing a big part of the bill. The FCIC allows farmers growing 
corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat to purchase two main 
kinds of insurance that have been affected by the drought: 
yield-based insurance, which pays out relative to the farmers 
normal historical output, and revenue-based insurance, 
which pays out relative to a projected price and yield.

In fact, following an estimated $13 billion in payouts to 

140,000 policyholders from Hurricane Sandy, the program is 
more than $30 billion in debt and has Congress scratching 
its head about what to do about it, since the private insurers 
have made it very clear this is not a business that they wish 
to be in. While Congress enacted reforms to the NFIP in 2012 
intended to bring premiums up to actuarially accurate levels, 
the law continues to cap the annual increase in premiums, 
and it isnt clear when or if premiums will catch up to actual 
risk as it continues to rise due to climate change.

While both protection plans have increased in recent 

Using Economic Research Service (ERS) estimates for a  

years, the face value of revenue protection insurance policies 
has risen by more than a factor of four over the past decade, 
accounting for $86 billion, or 75 percent, of the FCICs total 
liabilities of $115 billion.17

As the severity and duration of droughts have intensified 

over the past decade, the FCIC program has suffered from 
the same problems plaguing the National Flood Insurance 
Programincreases in premiums being paid in have not kept 
pace with increases in claims being paid out. In 2011 alone, 
smaller crop yields related to drought, rising incidents of 
insects and disease, and bad weather resulted in the Federal 
Crop Insurance Corporation losing $11 billion, with losses 
this past year rising to $14 billion.18

Food Costs
In addition to the lost output and earnings associated with 
the drought, U.S. consumers are also expected to pay climate 
costs in the form of higher grocery bills in 2013 due to the 
nine- to ten-month lag between prices on the farm and prices 
at the grocery store. 

3.5 percent rise in food at home prices and a 3 percent rise 
in food away from home prices, Americans grocery bills are 
expected to rise by an inflation-adjusted $24 billion in 2013, 
due largely to the impacts of this past years drought.19 While 
most of these costs are being paid directly by consumers, the 
U.S. government is expected to cover about $2.3 billion of 
these costs directly as the countrys single-largest purchaser 
of food.

The Forest Service (FS) and the Department of the Interior 
(DOI) are responsible for protecting most federal lands from 
wildfires. The Forest Service was created in 1905 with an early 
focus on halting wildfires. Its efforts were largely successful 

early on, but the costs of wildfire prevention have risen in the 
past decade due to drought conditions, beetle infestation, 
human interaction, and past suppression in fire-dependent 
ecosystems. While increased budgets for fire prevention 
helped reduce acres burned between 2007 and 2010, total 
area burned rose back above 9 million acres in 2012.20

PaGE 10 | Who Pays for Climate Change?

CoNCLusioN
Taken together, the costs of disaster recovery, flood insurance, 
crop insurance, and forest firefighting represent a major 
expenditure in U.S. federal budgets, reaching an all-time high 
of $96 billion in 2012.

Increases in these costs due to climate change not only 

damage the economy and heighten uncertainty with respect 
to investment, but they also crowd out spending on other 
government programs. Indeed, if these losses were accounted 

for as a line item in the federal budget, they would be 
equivalent to 16 percent of all non-defense discretionary 
spending in fiscal year 2012more than we spend on 
transportation or education each year. 

Furthermore, when these climate-related costs are 

compared to total costs paid by the insurance industry for 
climate-related disasters it is clear that the U.S. government 
is now paying far more in preparedness and insurance costs 
than the entire insurance industry combined by a factor of 
three.

While some of these federal insurance programs offer

liabilities have largely been assumed by the public sector due 
to a lack of private-sector alternatives. The true scorekeepers 
of climate riskthe insurance industryare withdrawing 
from climate-related product lines, and the federal 
government is spending far more on responding to extreme 
weather than on preventing it. 

Fortunately, there is much President Obama can do to 
fight climate change without waiting for Congress to pass 
new legislation. Regulating emissions from existing power 
plants, emphasizing energy efficiency, and strengthening 
implementation of the Clean Air Act will put us on the  
right track.
