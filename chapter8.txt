Are There Underlying Organization Rules?

Regulatory Network of E.Coli

Regulatory Network of Yeast

Thieffry, Collado-Vides, 1998
Shen-Orr, Alon, Nature Genetics 2002

Mazurie  et al. Genome Biology 2005 6:R35

Consider Subgraphs With n Nodes

 n=1 Self-loops and isolated nodes
 n=2 An edge, or a loop of two nodes
 n=3 Potentially 13 types of connected directed graphs

 Surprise: only 1 type shows in E.Coli/Yeast networks:

Feed Forward Loop (FFL)

Two More Motifs For n=4

n=4  199 motif candidates

n=5  9364

n=6  1,530,843 motif candidates
Enumeration is impractical

Regulatory Nets Use Motifs

n=1  Auto-regulation

Only A Small Number of Motifs Is Used

 n=3 FFL; Coherent type 1 &  incoherent type 1 dominate
 n=4  SIM  or DOR

The Challenges

How do we tell motifs from random sub-graphs?

What do motifs do? What are they good for?

How did motif arise? How do they evolve?

Discovering Network

Motifs

How Do We Tell A Motif?

Motifs

 Sequence motif: statistically significant set of homologous sub-sequences
 Protein motif: statistically significant set of similar folds

Net Motif=statistically significant set of isomorphic subnets

 E.g., FFL, SIM, DOR....
 But how do we decide Statistically significant?
 Recall sequence motifs: compare motif against background statistics
 Need to compare motif statistics against random graph
 Which randomness: Erdos-Reneyi (ER)? Scale-free? Small-world? Other?

Finding Motifs in ER Random Graphs
 Compare the observed network against a respective ER network

 Let R=<N,E> be the observed network; N=#nodes, E=#edges
 A comparison ER network is the random graph G(N,p) where p=E/N2

 Given a motif, let P(m)= probability of m motif occurrences in G(N,p)

 P(m) defines the statistics for finding the motif in an ER random network
 Let M be the expected value of P and let   be its standard deviation.

 Statistical significance can be evaluated by standard Z-score or p-value

 Z=(MR-M)/
 MR is the # of occurrences of the motif in the observed network R

 Computational challenges

 Given a motif, how to compute M, and MR?
 Given a network, how do we discover motifs?

Auto-regulation is A Motif

 Auto-regulation= self-loop
(cid:1)(cid:1)

 Negative feedback

(cid:1)(cid:1)

(cid:1)

X

Repression threshold

X(t)

t

 P(m)= probability of m self loops in G(N,p): P(m)=B(m,p)=     pm(1-p)N-m

 Expected # of self loops =pN=(E/N2)N=E/N
 Standard deviation = E/N

N
m

 For E.coli N=424, E=519

 A random graph would have E/N~1.2 self loop and ~1.1
 But E.coli has 40 self-loops

 The Z-score: Z=(40-1.2)/1.1~35

 Conclusion: Self-loop is a motif

Discovering Small Motifs
Represent the network as an adjacency matrix A

                1       if gene j activates gene i
 A(i,j)=  -1       if gene j represses gene I
                0        otherwise

Scan A for all nxn sub-matrices

 Count motif frequencies

E.g., for n=3 there are 13 possible motifs

 Motifs = non-isomorphic directed graphs on 3 nodes
 Exhaustive search is useful only for small motifs

Computing p-Value

 Two challenges:

 How to generate good random networks
 How to compute motif frequencies for each motif

 How to generate comparison random networks?

 Key idea: use the real network R to provide background statistics
 Randomly switch edges of R
 Preserve the # of subnets of size 3,4,...n-1

(when searching motifs of size n)

 (Generalizing ER; ER considers only n=2)
 Variants: use Metropolis (Gibbs) sampling to switch edges

(Switch edges with temperature-dependent probability exp(-E/T))

Probabilistic Algorithm For Motif Finding

 Challenge: how to reduce complexity
 Key-idea: sample the network to detect motif frequency

Subgraph Sampling Algorithm:
1.
2.

Initialize: start an n-subgraph by selecting a random edge
Iterate:
select a random edge connecting subgraph to a new node
add new node, until subgraph has n nodes.
3. Repeat 1-2 to collect a set of n-subgraphs
4. Compute weighted concentration of distinct n-subgraphs

 concentrations and detecting network motifs; Bioinformatics 2004.
