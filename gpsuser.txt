CHAPTER 1:  SYSTEM OVERVIEW

1.1  GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The  Navstar  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  is  a  space-based  radio-positioning  and  time-
transfer  system.    GPS  provides  accurate  position,  velocity,  and  time  (PVT)  information  to  an
unlimited number of suitably equipped ground, sea, air and space users.  Passive PVT fixes are
available  world-wide  in  all-weathers  in  a  world-wide  common  grid  system.    Normally  GPS
contains  features  which  limit  the  full  accuracy  of  the  service  only  to  authorized  users  and
protection from spoofing (hostile imitation).

GPS comprises three major system segments, Space, Control, and User (see Figure 1-1).

1-1

ranging  codes  and  navigation  data  messages.    The  Space,  Control,  and  User  Segments  are
described in more detail in paragraph 1.2.

The ranging codes broadcast by the satellites enable a GPS receiver to measure the transit time of
the  signals  and  thereby  determine  the  range  between  each  satellite  and  the  receiver.    The
navigation data message enables a receiver to calculate the position of each satellite at the time
the  signals  were  transmitted.    The  receiver  then  uses  this  information  to  determine  its  own
position,  performing  calculations  similar  to  those  performed  by  other  distance-measuring
navigation  equipment.    Conceptually,  each  range  measurement  defines  a  sphere  centered  on  a
satellite.  The common intersection point of the spheres on or near the earth's surface defines the
receiver position.

For GPS positioning, a minimum of four satellites are normally required to be simultaneously "in
view"  of  the  receiver,  thus  providing  four  range  measurements.    This  enables  the  receiver  to
calculate  the  three  unknown  parameters  representing  its  (3-D)  position,  as  well  as  a  fourth
parameter representing the user clock error.  Treating the user clock error as an unknown enables
most receivers to be built with an inexpensive crystal oscillator rather than an expensive precision
oscillator or atomic clock.  Precise time estimates are required for precise positioning, since a time
error of 3 nanoseconds is roughly equivalent to a range error of 1 metre.  Less than four satellites
can be used by a receiver if time or altitude is precisely known or if these parameters are available
from an external source.  A more detailed explanation of the GPS theory of operation is provided
in paragraph 1.4.

1.2  SYSTEM OVERVIEW

1.2.1  Space Segment

The GPS Space Segment consists of 24 Navstar satellites in semi-synchronous (approximately 12-
hour) orbits.  The satellites are arranged in six orbital planes with four satellites in each plane. 
The  orbital  planes  have  an  inclination  angle  of  55  degrees  relative  to  the  earth's  equator.    The
satellites  have  an  average  orbit  altitude  of  20200  kilometres  (10900  nautical  miles)  above  the
surface of the earth.  Figure 1-2 illustrates the GPS satellite constellation.

The satellites complete one orbit in approximately 11 hours and 58 minutes.  Since the earth is
rotating under the satellites, the satellites trace a track over the earths surface which repeats every
23 hours and 56 minutes.  A user at a fixed location on the ground will observe the same satellite
each day passing through the same track in the sky, but the satellite will rise and set four minutes
earlier each day, due to the 4 minute difference between the rotational period of the earth and two
orbital periods of a satellite.  The satellites are positioned in the orbital planes so that four or more
satellites, with a good geometric relationship for positioning, will normally be observable at every
location on earth.  The effect of geometric relationships on GPS positioning accuracy is explained
in further detail in Chapter 3.

1-2

Figure 1-2. GPS Satellite Constellation

The satellites transmit ranging signals on two D-band frequencies: Link 1 (Ll ) at 1575.42  MHz
and  Link  2  (L2)  at  1227.6  MHz.  The  satellite  signals  are  transmitted  using  spread-spectrum
techniques,  employing  two  different  ranging  codes  as  spreading  fictions,  a  1.023  MHz
coarse/acquisition code (C/A-code) on L1 and a 10.23 MHz precision code (P-code) on both L1
and  L2.  Either  the  C/A-code  or  the  P-code  can  be  used  to  determine  the  range  between  the
satellite and the user, however, the P-code is normally encrypted and available only to authorized
users. When  encrypted,  the  P-code  is  known  as  the  Y-code.  A  50  Hz  navigation  message  is
superimposed  on  both  the  P(Y)  -code  and  the  C/A-code. The  navigation  message  includes
satellite  clock-bias  data,  satellite  ephemeris  (precise  orbital)  data  for  the  transmitting  satellite,
ionospheric signal-propagation correction data, and satellite almanac (coarse orbital) data for the
entire constellation. Refer to paragraph 1.4 for additional details regarding the ranging codes and
navigation  message.

1.2.2  Control  Segment

The Control Segment primarily consists of a Master Control Station (MCS), at Falcon Air Force
Base (AFB) in Colorado Springs, USA, plus monitor stations (MS) and ground antemas (GA) at
various  locations  around  the  world.  The  monitor  stations  are  located  at  Falcon  AFB,  Hawaii,

1- 3

Kwajalein, Diego Garcia, and Ascension.  All monitor stations except Hawaii and Falcon AFB are
also equipped with ground antennas (see Figure 1-3).  The Control Segment includes a Prelaunch
Compatibility Station (PCS) located at Cape Canaveral, USA, and a back-up MCS capability. 

1-4

Figure 1-4.  Monitor Station and Ground Antenna

The PCS primarily operates under control of the MCS to support prelaunch compatibility testing
of GPS satellites via a cable interface.  The PCS also includes an RF transmit/receive capability
that can serve as a Control Segment ground antenna, if necessary.  The U.S. Air Force Satellite
Control Network (AFSCN) consists of a multipurpose worldwide network of ground- and space-
based satellite control facilities.  Various AFSCN resources are available to support GPS but are
not dedicated exclusively to GPS.

1.2.3  User Segment
The User Segment consists of receivers specifically designed to receive, decode, and process the
GPS  satellite  signals.    Receivers  can  be  stand-alone,  integrated  with  or  embedded  into  other
systems.      GPS  receivers  can  vary  significantly  in  design  and  function,  depending  on  their
application for navigation, accurate positioning, time transfer, surveying and attitude reference. 
Chapter 2 provides a general description of GPS receiver types and intended applications.

 

1.3  GPS SERVICES
Two  levels  of  service  are  provided  by  the  GPS,  the  Precise  Positioning  Service  (PPS)  and  the
Standard Positioning Service (SPS). 

1.3.1  Precise Positioning Service
The  PPS  is  an  accurate  positioning  velocity  and  timing  service  which  is  available  only  to
authorized users.  The PPS is primarily intended for military purposes.  Authorization to use the
PPS  is  determined  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD),  based  on  internal  U.S.  defense
requirements  or  international  defense  commitments.    Authorized  users  of  the  PPS  include  U.S.

1-5

military  users,  NATO  military  users,  and  other  selected  military  and  civilian  users  such  as  the
Australian  Defense  Forces  and  the  U.S.  Defense  Mapping  Agency.    The  PPS  is  specified  to
provide  16  metres  Spherical  Error  Probable  (SEP)  (3-D,  50%)  positioning  accuracy  and  100
nanosecond (one sigma) Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time transfer accuracy to authorized
users.  This is approximately equal to 37 metres (3-D, 95%) and 197 nanoseconds (95%) under
typical  system  operating  conditions.    PPS  receivers  can  achieve  0.2  metres  per  second  3-D
velocity accuracy, but this is somewhat dependent on receiver design.

Access  to  the  PPS  is  controlled  by  two  features  using  cryptographic  techniques,  Selective
Availability (SA) and Anti-Spoofing (A-S).  SA is used to reduce GPS position, velocity, and time
accuracy to the unauthorized users.  SA operates by introducing pseudorandom errors into the
satellite signals.  The A-S feature is activated on all satellites to negate potential spoofing of the
ranging signals.  The technique encrypts the P-code into the Y-code.  Users should note the C/A
code is not protected against spoofing.

Encryption  keys  and  techniques  are  provided  to  PPS  users  which  allow  them  to  remove  the
effects of SA and A-S and thereby attain the maximum accuracy of GPS.  PPS receivers that have
not been loaded with a valid cryptographic key will have the performance of an SPS receiver.

PPS  receivers  can  use  either  the  P(Y)-code  or  C/A-code  or  both.    Maximum  GPS  accuracy  is
obtained using the P(Y)-code on both L1 and L2.  P(Y)-code capable receivers commonly use the
C/A-code to initially acquire GPS satellites.

1.3.2  Standard Positioning Service
The SPS is a less accurate positioning and timing service which is available to all GPS users.  In
peacetime, the level of SA is controlled to provide 100 metre (95%) horizontal accuracy which is
approximately  equal  to  156  metres  3D  (95%).    SPS  receivers  can  achieve  approximately  337
nanosecond (95%) UTC time transfer accuracy.   System accuracy degradations can be increased
if it is necessary to do so, for example, to deny accuracy to a potential enemy in time of crisis or
war.    Only  the  President  of  the  United  States,  acting  through  the  U.S.  National  Command
Authority, has the authority to change the level of SA to other than peacetime levels. 

The SPS is primarily intended for civilian purposes, although it has potential peacetime military
use.  Refer to "Technical Characteristics of the Navstar GPS" for additional details regarding SPS
performance characteristics.

1.4  GPS THEORY OF OPERATION

The ranging codes broadcast by the satellites enable a GPS receiver to measure the transit time
of the signals and thereby determine the range between a satellite and the user.  The navigation
message provides data to calculate the position of each satellite at the time of signal transmission. 
From this information, the user position coordinates and the user clock offset are calculated using
be
simultaneous 

equations.

simultaneously "in view" of the receiver for 3-D positioning purposes.  The following paragraphs
give a description of the GPS satellite signals and GPS receiver operation.

1.4.1  GPS Satellite Signals

1.4.1.1  C/A-Code
The C/A-code consists of a 1023 bit pseudorandom noise (PRN) code with a clock rate of 1.023
MHz which repeats every 1 millisecond.  The short length of the C/A-code sequence is designed
to enable a receiver to rapidly acquire the satellite signals which helps the receiver transition to the
longer P-code.  A different PRN is assigned to each GPS satellite and selected from a set of codes
called Gold codes.  The Gold codes are designed to minimize the probability that a receiver will
mistake one code for another (minimize the cross-correlation).  The C/A-code is transmitted only
on L1.  The C/A-code is not encrypted and is therefore available to all users of GPS.

1.4.1.2  P(Y)-Code

The P-code is a 10.23 MHz PRN code sequence that is 267 days in length.  Each of the GPS
satellites is assigned a unique seven-day segment of this code that restarts every Saturday/Sunday
midnight  GPS  time  (GPS  time  is  a  continuous  time  scale    maintained  within  1  microsecond  of
UTC, plus or minus a whole number of leap seconds).  The P-code is normally encrypted into the
Y-code  to  protect  the  user  from  spoofing.    Since  the  satellites  have  the  capability  to  transmit
either the P- or Y-code, it is often referred to as the P(Y)-code.  The P(Y)-code is transmitted by
each satellite on both L1 and L2.  On L1, the P(Y)-code is 90 degrees out of carrier phase with
the C/A-code.

1.4.1.3  Navigation Message
A  50  Hz  navigation  message  is  superimposed  on  both  the  P(Y)  code  and  the  C/A-code.    The
navigation  message  includes  data  unique  to  the  transmitting  satellite  and  data  common  to  all
satellites.  The data contains the time of transmission of the message, a Hand Over Word (HOW)
for the transition from C/A-code to P(Y)-code tracking, clock correction, ephemeris, and health
data  for  the  transmitting  satellite,  almanac  and  health  data  for  all  satellites,  coefficients  for  the
ionospheric delay model, and coefficients to calculate UTC. 

The navigation message consists of 25 frames of data, each frame consisting of 1,500 bits.  Each
frame is divided into 5 subframes of 300 bits each (see Figure 1-5).  At the 50 Hz transmission
rate, it takes 6 seconds to receive a subframe, 30 seconds to receive one data frame, and 12.5
minutes  to  receive  all  25  frames.    Subframes  1,  2,  and  3  have  the  same  data  format  for  all  25
frames.    This  allows  the  receiver  to  obtain  critical  satellite-specific  data  within  30  seconds. 
Subframe  1  contains  the  clock  correction  for  the  transmitting  satellite,  as  well  as  parameters
describing the accuracy and health of the broadcast signal.  Subframes 2 and 3 contain ephemeris
(precise  orbital)  parameters  used  to  compute  the  location  of  the  satellite  for  the  positioning
equations.

Subframes 4 and 5 have data which cycle through the 25 data frames.  They contain data which is
common  to  all  satellites  and  less  critical  for  a  receiver  to  acquire  quickly.    Subframes  4  and  5
contain almanac (coarse orbital) data and low-precision clock corrections, simplified health and
configuration status for every satellite, user text messages, and the coefficients for the ionospheric
model and UTC calculation.  A comprehensive description  of  the navigation message is provided
in "Technical Characteristics of the Navstar GPS", together with the standard algorithms needed
to use the data correctly. 

1.4.1.4  Satellite Signal Modulation
The L1 carrier is BPSK modulated by both the C/A- and P(Y)-codes plus the navigation message
superimposed on both codes.  The L2 carrier is BPSK modulated by the P(Y)-code superimposed
with  the  navigation  message.    The  BPSK  technique  reverses  the  carrier  phase  when  the
modulating code changes from logic 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.   On L1, the C/A-code is 90 degrees out of
phase with the P(Y)-code.  Figure 1-6 shows this modulation scheme in schematic form.

1-8

Figure 1-6.  Satellite Signal Modulation

The BPSK modulation spreads the RF signals by the code bandwidth.  The result is a symmetrical
spreading of the signal around the L1 and L2 carriers.  The C/A-code spreads the L1 signal power
over a 2.046 MHz bandwidth centered at 1575.42 MHz.  The P(Y)-code spreads the L1 and L2
signal powers over a 20.46 MHz bandwidth centered about 1575.42 MHz on L1 and 1227.6 MHz
on L2.  Figure 1-7 shows the L1 and L2 signal spectrum as it appears at the 0 dB gain receiver
antenna at the Earth's surface.  The C/A-code component of L1 signal has a power of -160 dBW
(decibels with respect to one watt), the L1 P(Y)-code signal has a power of -163 dBW, and the
L2 P(Y)-code signal has a power of -166 dBW.

1.4.2  GPS Receiver Operation
In order for the GPS receiver to calculate a PVT solution, it must:

Search for a PRN C/A code lock
C/A code track, carrier track
Obtain bit synchronization with the navigation message
Obtain frame synchronization, ie obtain HOW  and Z count
Decode GUV or CVw
Remove SA
Transition to P(Y)-code, -code lock, -carrier lock
Data lock on P(Y) code
Search, acquire and track 2nd to 4th SVs, up to all in view

solution.

Details of the operations are expanded below.

1.4.2.1  Satellite Selection
A  typical  satellite  tracking  sequence  begins  with  the  receiver  determining  which  satellites  are
visible for it to track.  If the receiver can immediately determine satellite visibility, the receiver will
target a satellite to track and begin the acquisition process.  Satellite visibility is determined based
on the GPS satellite almanac and the initial receiver estimate (or user input) of time and position. 
If the receiver does not have the almanac and position information stored, the receiver enters a
"search the sky" operation that systematically searches the PRN codes until lock is obtained on
one  of  the  satellites  in  view.    Once  one  satellite  is  successfully  tracked,  the  receiver  can
demodulate the navigation message data stream and acquire the current almanac as well as the
health status of all the other satellites in the constellation.

Depending on its architecture, a receiver selects either a "best" subset of the visible satellites to
track or uses all healthy satellites in view to determine an "all-in-view" PVT solution.  The all-in-
view  solution  is  usually  more  accurate  than  a  four  satellite  solution  although  it  requires  a

1-10

more complex  receiver  and  receiver  processing.    The  all-in-view  solution  is  also  more  robust,
since the temporary loss of a satellite signal (for example due to a physical obstruction near the
receiver) does not disrupt the flow of PVT data while the receiver attempts to reacquire the lost
signal.    Many  receivers  will  track  more  than  four  satellites,  but  less  than  all-in-view,  as  a
compromise between complexity, accuracy, and robustness.  Receivers that select a "best" subset
do so based on geometry, estimated accuracy, or integrity.  More detailed discussion of specific
satellite selection criteria is provided in Chapter 6.

1.4.2.2  Satellite Signal Acquisition
The satellite signal power at or near the earth's surface is less than the receivers thermal (natural)
noise level, due to the spread spectrum modulation of the signal, orbital height and transmitting
power of the satellite.  To extract the satellite signal the receiver uses code correlation techniques.
An  internal  replica  of  the  incoming  signal  is  generated  and  aligned  with  the  received  satellite
signal. The receiver shifts the replica code to match the incoming code from the satellite. When
the codes match, the satellite signal is compressed back into the original carrier frequency band. 
This process is illustrated in Figure 1-8.

Figure 1-8.  Spread Spectrum Generation and Reconstruction

1-11

The delay in the receiver's code is a measure of the transit time of the signals between the satellite
and  the  receiver's  antenna  and  hence,  the  range  between  the  satellite  position  and  receiver
position.    This  measurement  is  called  a  pseudorange  measurement,  rather  than  a  range
measurement, because the receiver's  clock bias  has not been removed.

Receivers  typically  use  phase-locked-loop  techniques  to  synchronize  the  receiver's  internally
generated code and carrier with the received satellite signal. A code tracking loop is used to track
the C/A- and P-code signals while a carrier tracking loop is used to track the carrier frequency. 
The  two  tracking  loops  work  together  in  an  interactive  process,  aiding  each  other,  in  order  to
acquire and track the satellite signals.  A generic GPS receiver tracking system is illustrated in
Figure 1-9.

1.4.2.3 Down Conversion
The received RF signal is converted, usually through two intermediate frequencies (IF), down to a
frequency near the code baseband, that can be sampled by an analogue to digital (A/D) converter.
 Inphase  and  quadrature  digital  samples  are  taken  to  preserve  the  phase  information  in the
received signal.  The samples are usually two bits to reduce conversion losses.  The sampling rate
must be higher than the code chipping rate for a non return to zero code, that is, greater than
10.23 MHz for the P(Y)-code.  To ensure the phase of the received signal is maintained, all local
oscillators are derived from, and phased locked through, a series of synthesizers derived from the
receiver's master oscillator.  Following the A/D conversion there

1-12

is a  final  phase  rotation  circuit  that  enables  the  doppler  in  the  satellite  signal  to  be  precisely
tracked.

1.4.2.4  Code Tracking
The code tracking loop is used to make pseudorange measurements between the GPS satellites
and the GPS receiver.  The receiver's code tracking loop generates a replica of the C/A-code of
the targeted satellite.  The estimated doppler is removed by the phase rotation circuit prior to the
correlator.

In order to align the received signal with the internally generated replica, the internally generated
code  is  systematically  slewed  past  the  received  signal.  Typically  the  output  of  the  correlator  is
integrated  over  1  to  10  ms.  If  correlation  is  not  detected  the  phase  of  the  internally  generated
code  is  advanced  by  one  chip.    If  correlation  is  not  detected  after  the  whole  code  has  been
searched  the  doppler  is  adjusted  and  the  process  repeated  until  correlation  is  achieved.  Code
synchronization is initially maintained by also correlating the received signal with half chip early
and late codes. A simple feedback system keeps the prompt ("on time") code correctly positioned.
 To extract the carrier which is still modulated by the navigation message,  the prompt code is
subtracted from the incoming signal.  The delay that the receiver must add to the replica code to
achieve  synchronization  (correlation),  multiplied  by  the  speed  of  light,  is  the  pseudorange
measurement.    Once  the  carrier  is  reconstructed,  the  center  frequency  of  the  replica  code  is
adjusted  using  Doppler  measurements  from  the  carrier  tracking  loop  to  achieve  a  precise
frequency lock to the incoming signal, thereby allowing more precise pseudorange measurements.
The  bandwidth  of  the  code  tracking  loop  is  typically  0.1  Hz,  which  implies  that  independent
measurements are available at approximately 10 s intervals.

1.4.2.5  Carrier Tracking and Data Detection
The  receiver  tracks  the  satellite  carrier  by  adjusting  the  frequency  synthesizers  to  produce  a
stationary phase at the output of the code tracking loop.  The inphase and quadrature components
are used to calculate the carrier's phase and doppler.  A data bit is detected by a sudden change in
the phase of the detected signal. The bandwidth of the carrier tracking loop is typically 6 Hz for a
military airborne receiver, resulting in independent measurements being available every 150 ms.

Doppler is measured to provide an estimate of the relative velocity between the receiver and the
satellite.  These measurements are typically termed pseudorange rate measurements or they can be
integrated over regular time intervals to produce deltarange measurements. 

The  receiver  uses  the  doppler  measurements  from  four  (or  more)  satellites  to  determine  the
receiver velocity (in three dimensions) plus the receiver's master oscillator frequency bias.  The
deltarange measurements of the carrier tracking loop are also used to aid the code tracking loop
to ensure code tracking is maintained during dynamic maneuvers where the simple  code tracking
system would be unable to maintain lock.

1-13

1.4.2.6  Data Demodulation
Once the carrier tracking loop is locked, the 50 Hz navigation data message can be read.  Each
subframe  of  the  navigation  message  begins  with  a  preamble  contained  in  the  Telemetry  Word,
enabling the receiver to detect the beginning of each subframe.  Each subframe is identified by bits
contained in the Handover Word (HOW), enabling the receiver to properly decode the subframe
data.

1.4.2.7  P(Y)-Code Signal Acquisition
The  one  millisecond  C/A-code  length  permits  a  relatively  narrow  search  window  for  code
correlation even if the receiver must "search the sky" to find the first satellite. However the week
long P(Y)-code sequence at 10.23 MHz does not allow the same technique to be used.  Precise
time must be known by the receiver in order to start the code generator within a few hundred
chips of the correlation point of the incoming signal.  The HOW contained in the GPS navigation
message  provides  satellite  time  and  hence  the    P(Y)-code  phase  information.    A  P(Y)-code
receiver may attempt to acquire the P(Y)-code directly, without first acquiring the C/A-code, if it
has  accurate  knowledge  of  position,  time  and  satellite  ephemeris  from  a  recent  navigation
solution.    External  aiding  and/or  an  enhanced  acquisition  technique  are  usually  required  to
perform direct P(Y)-code acquisition. 

1.4.2.8  PVT Calculations
When  the  receiver  has  collected  pseudorange  measurements,  deltarange  measurements,  and
navigation data from four (or more) satellites, it calculates the navigation solution, PVT.  Each
navigation  data  message  contains  precise  orbital  (ephemeris)  parameters  for  the  transmitting
satellite, enabling a receiver to calculate the position of each satellite at the time the signals were
transmitted.  The ephemeris data is normally valid and can be used for precise navigation for a
period  of  four  hours  following  issue  of  a  new  data  set  by  the  satellite.  New  ephemeris  data  is
transmitted by the satellites every two hours.

As  illustrated  in  Figure  1-10,  the  receiver  solves  a  minimum  of  four  simultaneous  pseudorange
equations, with the receiver (3-D) position and clock offset as the four unknown variables.  Each
equation  is  an  expression  of  the  principle  that  the  true  range  (the  difference  between  the
pseudorange and the receiver clock offset) is equal to the distance between the known satellite
position  and  the  unknown  receiver  position.    This  principle  is  expressed  below  mathematically
using the same notation as Figure 1-10.

These are simplified versions of the equations actually used by GPS receivers.  A receiver also
obtains corrections derived from the navigation messages which it applies to the pseudoranges. 
These  include  corrections  for  the  satellite  clock  offset,  relativistic  effects,  ionospheric  signal
propagation  delays.    Dual  frequency  receivers  can  measure  the  delay  between  the  L1  and  L2
P(Y)-codes,  if  available,  to  calculate  an  ionospheric  correction.    Single  frequency  (either  C/A-

1-14

D
or P(Y)-code)  receivers  use  parameters  transmitted  in  the  navigation  message  to  be  used  in  an
ionospheric model. The receiver (3-D) velocity and frequency offset are calculated using similar
equations, using deltaranges instead of pseudoranges.

The PVT calculations described here result in a series of individual point solutions.  For receivers
that are required to provide a navigation solution under dynamic conditions a smoothed or filtered
solution that is less sensitive to measurement noise is employed. One of the most common types
of  filters  used  in  GPS  receivers  is  the  Kalman  filter.    Kalman  filtering  is  described  in  detail  in
Chapter 9.

The rate at which GPS receivers calculate the PVT solution is governed by their application. For
flight control applications a 10 Hz rate is required whereas in handheld equipment a fix may only
be required once every 4 to 5 seconds or at even longer intervals. A 1 Hz rate is typical for many
equipments.  In  this  scenario  pseudorange  measurements  are  typically  only  made  every  4  to  5
seconds; pseudorange rate measurements are made more frequently and can be used to propagate
the  filter  solution  between  updates.  If  a  Kalman  filter  is  used  the  measurements  may  be
incorporated 
the  requirement  for  symmetrical
measurements  from  all  channels.  The  filter  also  allows  the  solution  to  be  extrapolated  if
measurements are interrupted, or data is available from other navigation sensors.

the  filter  removing

into 

A minimum of four satellites are normally required to be simultaneously "in view" of the receiver,
thus  providing  four  pseudorange  and  four  deltarange  measurements.    Treating  the  user  clock
errors as unknowns enable most receivers to be built with an inexpensive crystal oscillator rather
than an expensive precision oscillator or atomic clock.  Less than four satellites can be used by a
receiver  if  time  or  altitude  are  precisely  known  or  if  these  parameters  are  available  from  an
external source.

GPS  receivers  perform  initial  position  and  velocity  calculations  using  an  earth-centered  earth-
fixed (ECEF) coordinate system.  Results may be converted to an earth model (geoid) defined by
the World Geodetic System  1984  (WGS 84).   WGS  84  provides  a  worldwide common grid
system that may be translated into local coordinate systems or map datums.  (Local map datums
are a best fit to the local shape of the earth and not valid worldwide.)  For more details regarding
WGS 84, refer to Annex B.  For more details regarding how a receiver uses WGS 84, refer to
"Technical Characteristics of the Navstar GPS".

For navigation purposes, it is usually necessary for a GPS receiver to output positions in terms of
magnetic  North  rather  than  true  North  as  defined  by  WGS  84.    For  details  regarding  how  the
receiver calculates the magnetic variation from true North, refer to "Technical Characteristics of
the Navstar GPS".

1.4.2.9  Degraded Operation and Aiding
During periods of high levels of jamming, the receiver may not be able to maintain both code and
carrier tracking.  The receiver normally has the capability to maintain code tracking even when
carrier tracking is no longer possible. If only code tracking is available, the receiver will slew the
locally generated carrier and code signals based on predicted rather than measured Doppler shifts.
 These  predictions  are  performed  by  the  receiver  processor,  which  may  have  additional  PVT
information available from an external aiding source.  See Chapter 7 for additional discussion of
GPS receiver aiding.

1.5  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.5.1  System Development and Management

The United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command, Space and Missile Center
(SMC),  Navstar  GPS  Joint  Program  Office  (JPO)  has  total  system  responsibility  for  the  GPS. 
The SMC and GPS JPO are located at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (AFB) in Los Angeles,
California.    The  GPS  JPO  is  manned  by  personnel  from  the  USAF,  US  Navy,  US  Army,  US
Marine Corps, US Department of Transportation, US Defense Mapping Agency.  NATO Nations
and Australia may have representatives stationed at the JPO.  The GPS JPO was responsible for
development  of  the  Control  and  Space  Segments  and  is  responsible  for  acquisition  of
replenishment satellites and common user equipment (UE) for all military services.  The GPS JPO
also provides technical support, security guidance, technical specification development, interface
control  documents,  and  implementation  guidelines.    NATO  and  other  allied  Nations  have
established Memoranda of Understanding with the United States which provides access to PPS,
interchange of technical information, and the ability to purchase or locally manufacture PPS GPS
UE.

The  GPS  JPO  is  supported  by  the  Launch  Vehicle  System  Program  Office  (SPO)  and  the
Network  SPO,  also  located  at  the  SMC.    The  Launch  Vehicle  SPO  provides  the  expendable
boosters used to launch the Navstar satellites.  The Network SPO is responsible for continuing
development  of  the  multi-use  AFSCN.    GPS  JPO  program  management  operations  are  also
supported by the User Equipment Support Program Manager located at the Warner-Robbins Air
Logistics Center in Warner Robbins, Georgia and by Detachment 25 (from the Sacramento Air
Logistics Center) located at Colorado Springs, Colorado.

1.5.2  System Requirements, Planning, and Operations
The  USAF  Space  Command  (AFSPC)  is  responsible  for  GPS  requirements,  planning,  and
operations.  Headquarters of the AFSPC and the requirements and planning functions are located
at  Peterson  AFB  in  Colorado  Springs,  Colorado.    Various  agencies  within  the  USAF  Space
Command (AFSPC) operate and maintain the Control Segment, prepare and launch the Navstar
satellites,  manage  the  operational  constellation,  and  interface  with  the  GPS  user  community. 
Elements  of  the  AFSPC  Fiftieth  Space  Wing  (50SPW)  are  responsible  for  launch,  early  orbit
support, and continued day-to-day operations of the GPS satellites.

1-17

The  First  Space  Operations  Squadron  (1SOPS)  of  the  50SPW,  located  at  Falcon  AFB  in
Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides launch and early-orbit support for the GPS satellites.  The
early  orbit  support  includes  control  of  the  Navstar  satellites  to  deploy  solar  arrays,  perform
stabilization maneuvers, and complete other procedures to make the satellites ready for service. 
The 1SOPS can also provide backup capability for critical day-to-day commanding procedures if
necessary.    When  a  satellite  is  ready  for  service,  command  is  transferred  to  the  Second  Space
Operations Squadron (2SOPS) of the 50SPW for payload turn-on and continued operations.  The
2SOPS has responsibility for day-to-day operations and overall constellation management.  The
2SOPS is also located at Falcon AFB.

The Forty-Fifth Space Wing (45SPW) of the AFSPC is responsible for management of Navstar
pre-launch  operations,  including  receiving  of  the  satellites,  storage  on  the  ground  if  necessary,
mating to the launch vehicle, and integration and compatibility testing.  The 45SPW is located at
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, which is the launch site for the GPS satellites.

1.6  GPS PROGRAM HISTORY

1.6.1  Pre-Concept Validation (1960s-1972)
Since  the  early  1960s  various  U.S.  agencies  have  had  navigation  satellite  programs.    The  John
Hopkins'  Applied  Research  Laboratory  sponsored  the  TRANSIT  program  and  the  U.S.  Navy
(USN) sponsored the TIMATION (TIMe navigATION) program.  TIMATION was a program to
advance the state of the art for two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) navigation.  TRANSIT
became operational in 1964 and is currently providing navigation service to low dynamic vehicles
such as ships.  It is scheduled to be phased out in 1996.  The USAF conducted concept studies to
assess a three-dimensional (latitude, longitude, and altitude) navigation system called 621B. 

1.6.2  Phase I - Concept Validation (1973-1979)
A memorandum issued by the US Deputy Secretary of Defense on 17 April 1973 designated the
USAF as the executive service to consolidate the TIMATION and 621B concepts into a compre-
hensive  all-weather  navigation  system  named  Navstar  GPS.    The  Navstar  GPS  JPO  was
established on 1 July 1973.

Two  experimental  Navigation  Technology  Satellites  (NTS)  were  built  and  launched  to  support
concept validation of the GPS.  The first true GPS signals from space came from NTS-2.  NTS-2
was launched on an Atlas booster from Vandenberg AFB in June 1977 but malfunctioned after
only 8 months.  The first Navstar GPS Block I (research and development) satellite was launched
in February 1978.  A total of 11 Block I satellites were launched between 1978 and 1985.  All of
the  Block  I  satellites  were  launched  from  Vandenberg  AFB  using  the  Atlas  booster.    Block  I
satellites  did  not  incorporate  SA  or  A-S  features.    As  of  June  1995  only  one  Block  I  satellite
remained operational.  Table 1-1 contains the launch dates and status (as of June 1995) of the
NTS and Block I satellites.

The  first  Control  Segment  consisted  of  a  control  station,  ground  antenna,  and  monitor  station
located  at  Vandenberg  AFB  in  California,  supported  by  additional  monitor  stations  located  at
Elmendorf AFB in Alaska, Anderson AFB in Guam, and the Naval Communications Station in
Hawaii.  This Phase I Control Segment was designated the Initial Control System (ICS).

The  first  user  equipment  (UE)  testing  began  at  Yuma  Proving  Ground  (YPG)  in  March  1977
using ground transmitters to simulate the GPS satellites.  As the Block I satellites were launched,
a combination of satellites and ground transmitters were used for testing until December 1978,
when four satellites were available to provide limited 3-D navigation capability.  Shipborne UE
was tested off the coast of California starting in October 1978 when three GPS satellites were
available for two-dimensional (2-D) navigation.

1.6.3  Phase II - Full Scale Development (1979-1985)
In September 1980, a contract was awarded to upgrade and operate the ICS, as well as develop
an Operational Control System (OCS).  The ICS upgrades ensured continued support to the UE
test  team  while  the  OCS  was  being  developed.    OCS  equipment  was  delivered  to  Vandenberg
AFB  in  May  1985.    In  October  1985,  after  installation  and  initial  testing,  the  OCS  conducted
dual operations with the ICS.  The OCS equipment was moved from Vandenberg to its permanent
site at Falcon AFB by the end of 1985.  In December 1980, the contractor was

1-19

selected  to  provide  28  Block  II  (operational)  Navstar  GPS  satellites.    Development  of  the
satellites continued throughout Phase II.

Phase II for the User Segment was divided into two parts.  In Phase IIA, starting in July 1979,
four contractors were selected to conduct performance analyses and preliminary design of UE.  In
Phase  IIB,  starting  in  1982,  two  of  the  four  contractors  were  selected  to  continue  UE
development.    Phase  IIB  included  design  refinement,  fabrication  of  prototypes,  qualification
testing, and extensive field testing of the UE. The UE was tested at YPG and at sea.  Testing at
sea was conducted by Naval Ocean Systems Center located in San Diego, California.

1.6.4  Phase III - Production and Deployment (1986 to Present)

1.6.4.1  Space Segment (1986 to Present)
The Block II satellites were originally designed to be launched aboard the Space Transportation
System (Space Shuttle).  Following an accident with the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986, the
Block  II  satellite-to-launch-vehicle  interface  was  modified  to  enable  launch  aboard  the  Delta  II
booster.    The  first  Block  II  satellite  was  launched  on  14  February  1989.    The  combined
constellation of Block I and Block II satellites achieved worldwide two-dimensional positioning
capability in June 1991.  Worldwide 3-D capability was achieved in 1993.  The Initial Operational
Capability (IOC) was declared on 8 December 1993.  A full 24-satellite constellation of Block II
satellites  was  achieved  in  April  1994.    The  military  Full  Operational  Capability  is  planned  for
1995.  The remaining Block II satellites will be launched on demand.  Table 1-2 is a summary of
the Block II launch dates and status.

In June of 1989 a contract was awarded for 20 GPS replenishment satellites, designated Block
IIR.    The  Block  IIR  satellites  will  have  the  capability  to  autonomously  generate  their  own
navigation  messages.    The  Block  IIR  production  schedule  may  allow  a  first  launch  as  early  as
August  1996.    In  1994,  efforts  were  begun  by  the  GPS  JPO  to  procure  additional  Navstar
satellites  to  sustain  the  GPS  satellite  constellation  past  the  year  2000.    These  satellites  are
designated Block IIF (Follow-On).  The contract to provide the Block IIF satellites is planned for
November 1995.  The planned production schedule supports a first launch in the year 2001.

In 1994 the GPS JPO also began studies for an Augmented GPS (AGPS).  The AGPS concept is
to enhance the availability, accuracy and integrity of the GPS system using up to six geostationary
AGPS satellites.  The satellites would broadcast integrity information and range corrections for all
GPS satellites via GPS-like ranging signals.

1.6.4.2  Control Segment (1986 to Present)
The GPS OCS achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) in December 1986.  In  March 1986,
the  ICS  at  Vandenberg  AFB  was  deactivated.    In  December  1989,  verification  of  the  OCS
operational  capability  was  completed  by  the  USAF  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  Center.
Turnover of the OCS to AFSPC was accomplished in June 1990.  Since then, Control Segment
development  activities  have  been  limited  to  upgrades  of  the  operational  software  and  additions

1-21

to the equipment and facilities.  The OCS has been augmented with a transportable GA capability
and Back-Up MCS capability.

1.6.4.3  User Segment (1986 to Present)

1.6.4.3.1  GPS JPO Activities
In April 1985, the contractor was selected for the Phase III production GPS UE.  Low rate initial
production  of  the  UE  was  begun  and  the  first  set  was  delivered  to  the  JPO  in  June  1988.    In
January  1992,  full  rate  production  of  the  UE  was  approved.    The  Phase  III  production  UE
includes the 5-channel Receiver 3A (R-2332/AR) for airborne use, the 5-channel Receiver 3S (R-
2331/AR) for shipboard use, the 2-channel Receiver OH (R-2399/AR) and UH (R-2400/AR) for
helicopter use, and the RPU-1 (R-2401/U) for manpack and ground vehicle use.

In 1989, a contract was awarded for 2-channel SPS C/A-code receivers to be used primarily for
demonstration and training.  These receivers are known as the Small Lightweight GPS Receiver
(SLGR, AN/PSN-10).  They are suitable for vehicle mounting or handheld use.  In 1990, a large
second purchase was made.  Although originally intended for nontactical use, these receivers were
used extensively in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.

In  November  1990,  a  contract  was  awarded  to  develop  a  5-channel  3/8  ATR  (Air  Transport
Rack) size Miniature Airborne GPS Receiver (MAGR) for use in aircraft where space is severely
limited.    The  contract  to  deliver  operational  models  was  awarded  in  April  1993  with  the  first
delivery occurring in July 1994.  Two versions of the MAGR have been produced.  One version
uses  an  RF  interface  directly  from  the  antenna  (R-2512/U)  the  other  (R-2514/U)  uses  an  IF
(intermediate frequency) interface from an antenna electronics unit.

In February 1993, a contract was awarded to produce a hand-held PPS GPS receiver.  Designated
the Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR, AN/PSN-11), it weighs less than 4 pounds, is
self-contained as a handheld unit, and can be adapted for vehicle mounting.  Delivery of the PLGR
began in September 1993.

In  the  1990s,  the  GPS  JPO  has  continued  to  sponsor  activities  to  improve  the  functions  and
performance of military GPS receivers.  Activities are continuing that will improve anti-jamming
performance  of  GPS  antennas,  antenna  electronics  units,  and  receiver  signal  processing.    In
1994, procurement efforts were begun for a new Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA).
The  new  CRPA  will  be  compatible    with  the  form,  fit,  and  function  of  the  existing  CRPA
system procured  by  the  JPO.    Efforts  are  also  underway  that  will  allow  Receiver  Autonomous
Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) to be implemented where enhanced GPS integrity or compatibility
with  civil  aviation  is  desired.    Other  efforts  are  underway  to  add  differential  GPS  (DGPS)  to
future military PPS receivers, to support new applications, such as precise positioning and aircraft
precision  approach.    Additional  programs  that  are  underway  or  under  consideration  include  a
space-based GPS PPS receiver, a miniaturized PLGR, and a Survey GPS Receiver (SGR).  Since
1993, the GPS JPO has been developing standards for a next generation PPS receiver module that
can be embedded in other military systems.  The JPO will not procure embedded GPS receivers
(EGRs), but will provide technical support so that other military programs can procure the EGR
as part of another system.

1-22

The JPO has released an EGR Guidelines document which contains EGR interface, design, and
performance  requirements,  as  well  as  general  guidance  material  regarding  the  EGR  and  host
system.    The  document  also  includes  specific  guidance  for  integrating  GPS  with  inertial  or
Doppler navigation systems.

The  JPO  EGR  effort  is  evolving  into  a  standard  for  a  GPS  Receiver  Applications  Module
(GRAM).  The GRAM will consist of a family of standard EGR modules suitable for a variety of
embedded  applications.    The  GRAM  standard  will  define  several  EGR  physical  configurations
conforming  to  standard  modular  architectures,  such  as  the  Standard  Electronic  Module  (SEM)
and  Versa  Module  Europa  (VME).    The  standard  will  include  specifications  for  advanced
functions,  such  as  local-  and  wide-area  DGPS  corrections  and  receiver-based  integrity
enhancements (RAIM).  The standard will also accommodate the next-generation GPS receiver
security module known as the Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM).

1.6.4.3.2  International Military UE and Commercial UE

Phase  III  of  the  GPS  program  has  seen  a  tremendous  expansion  in  the  development  and
production of international military UE and commercial UE.  Military UE is being produced by
participating NATO nations including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

In addition, a wide variety of commercial SPS UE has been developed by manufacturers around
the world for many different applications.  Some of these receivers have been acquired by Military
and  Government  authorities  for  nontactical  applications  such  as  surveying,  test  support,  and
training. 

1.6.4.3.3  User Equipment Testing

Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and OT&E have included test and evaluation of:

Integrated GPS/host vehicle navigation system performance

a.
b. Phase II and (early) Phase III deficiency corrections
c. Reliability and maintainability of the GPS UE
d. Operational effectiveness of the GPS UE against jamming and spoofing
e. The SA and A-S features

In  addition  to  U.S.-sponsored  test  efforts,  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  Germany,  the
Netherlands,  Norway,  and  the  United  Kingdom  conducted  an  extensive  Phase  III  International
Test  Program  in  cooperation  with  the  JPO.    These  countries  were  joined  by  France,  Greece,
Portugal, Spain, and Turkey for a subsequent International Test Program that focused exclusively
on the PLGR.

CHAPTER 2:  TYPES OF GPS RECEIVERS
AND THEIR INTENDED APPLICATIONS

2.1  GPS RECEIVER ARCHITECTURES

Modern  military  GPS  receivers  use  predominantly  a  continuous  satellite  tracking
architecture.  However,  some  receivers  use  alternative  architectures,  either
sequential or multiplex tracking to reduce hardware complexity.

2.1.1  Continuous Receivers

A  continuous  tracking  receiver  has  five  or  more  hardware  channels  to  track  four
satellites simultaneously plus other channels to acquire new satellites.  Due to their
greater complexity, these receivers were traditionally the most expensive but offer
the  best  performance  and  versatility.    The  multi-channel  receiver  uses  the  fifth
channel  to  read  the  NAVigation  (NAV)  message  of  the  next  satellite  to  be  used
when the receiver changes the satel lite selections.  It also uses the fifth channel in
conjunction  with  each  of  the  other  four  channels  to  perform  dual  frequency
measurements  as  well  as  differential  channel  delay  measurements.    Individual,
dedicated tracking channels enable the receivers to maintain accuracy under high
dynamics,  provide  the  best  anti-jamming  (A-J)  performance,  and  have  the  lowest
TTFF.  This type of receiver is best suited for high-dynamic vehicles such as fighter
aircraft,  vehicles  requiring  low  TTFF  such  as  submarines,  plus  any  user  requiring
good A-J performance.

2.1.2  Sequential Receivers

A sequential GPS receiver tracks the necessary satellites by typically using one or
two  hardware  channels.    The  set  will  track  one  satellite  at  a  time,  time  tag  the
measurements and combine them when all four satellite pseudoranges have been
measured.    These  receivers  are  among  the  least  expensive  available,  but  they
cannot  operate  under  high  dynamics  and  have  the  slowest  time-to-first-fix  (TTFF)
performance.

2.1.2.1  One-Channel Sequential Receivers
A  1-channel  sequential  receiver  makes  four  pseudorange  measurements  on  both
the  L1  and  L2 frequencies  in  order  to  determine  a  position  and  compensate  for
ionospheric delay.  The NAV message from each of the satellites must also be read
to  obtain  ephemeris  data.    To  determine  an  initial  position,  the  receiver  must
perform the following operations, 1) C/A- code  search for a SV, 2) C/A-code/carrier

calculations  in  the  receiver.    One-channel  sequential  receivers  are  limited  to  low-
dynamic or stationary applications.

2.1.2.2  Two-Channel Sequential Receivers

Two-channel  sequential  receivers  have  been  developed  for  use  on  medium-dynamic
vehicles such as helicopters.  During initial power-up each channel operates like a 1-
channel  sequential  receiver.    After  four  SVs  have  been  acquired,  one  channel  is
dedicated to navigation (pseudorange  measurements,  carrier  tracking,  etc.)  while  the
other  channel  reads  the  NAV  message  from  each  satellite.    Both  channels  are  also
used  to  perform  dual  frequency  measurements  to  compensate  for  ionospheric  delay
and to measure differential channel delay.  Two-channel sequential receivers decrease
the  time  it  takes  to  start  navigating  by  better  than  one  minute  when  compared  to  1-
channel sequential receivers.

2.1.3  Multiplex (MUX) Receivers

A MUX receiver switches at a fast rate (typically 50 Hz) between the satellites being
tracked,  continuously  collecting  sampled  data  to  maintain  two  to  eight  signal
processing algorithms in software.  In addition, the 50 Hz NAV message data is read
continuously  from  all  the  satellites.  In  single  channel  MUX  receivers  the  hardware
channel  is  time  shared  and  only  one  code  generator  and  one  carrier  synthesizer  is
required  to  track  the  satellites.      However,  a  multiplex  receiver's  measured  carrier  to
noise  ratio  (C/N)  for  any  satellite  signal  will  be  10  log  (n)  (where  n  is  the  number  of
satellites  being  tracked)  decibels  (dB)  below  that  of  a  continuous  tracking  receiver.
Consequently, for military receivers, the MUX technique has the disadvantage of lower
resistance  to  jamming  and  interference  when  compared  to  continuous  tracking
receivers. The MUX technique is more commonly found in commercial receivers where
the  reduced  hardware  cost  can  result  in  a  less  expensive  product  and  where
interference may be less of a concern.

2.2  "ALL-IN-VIEW" RECEIVERS

Traditionally, GPS receivers choose the four satellites of those available that give the
best geometry to perform a position fix.  However, in situations where one or more of
the satellites are temporarily obscured from the antenna's view, the receiver will have
to acquire additional satellite signals to generate a continuous PVT solution.  The PVT
solution  degrades  until  the  new  satellites  are  acquired.    One  solution  is  to  have  a
receiver which uses all available satellites in view to generate a solution.  The inherent
advantage  of  this  receiver  is  that  if  it  is  tracking  six  or  seven  SVs  and  a  satellite
becomes  obscured,  the  receiver  will  continue  to  provide  a  PVT  solution  with  little,  if
any,  degradation.    In  general,  over-determined  solutions  improve  accuracy  of  the
receivers.  If the receiver does not dedicate one hardware channel per satellite, then
the receiver must use some sort of continual re-acquisition strategy (see MUX receivers
paragraph 2.1.3).

2.3  AUTONOMOUS INTEGRITY MONITORING TECHNIQUES

GPS  receivers  may  track  additional  satellites  for  integrity  monitoring  purposes.    This
function  is  independent  of  receiver  architecture.  Integrity  monitoring  receivers  derive
multiple position solutions by excluding one satellite at a time.  Inconsistencies in the
results  are  used  to  identify  and  exclude  a  faulty  satellite.    In  general,  at  least  five
satellites must be tracked to detect an integrity failure, and at least six satellites must
be tracked to exclude an erroneous satellite. Other measurements, such as altitude or
time,  may  be  substituted  for  satellites  in  the  integrity  algorithms,  much  in  the  same
manner as these measurements are substituted in the PVT solution. In doing so, the
integrity of the aiding sources is checked as well.  The integrity monitoring algorithms
are  commonly  referred  to  as  Fault  Detection  and  Exclusion  (FDE)  algorithms  or  as
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM or AIM) algorithms. These algorithms
are typically executed on each new set of measurements, thus protecting the integrity
of each PVT data set output by the receiver.  For additional discussion of integrity, refer
to Chapter 12.

2.4  TIME TRANSFER RECEIVERS

One of the more common uses of GPS is for precise time dissemination applications.
Several manufacturers offer this type of equipment commercially.  These precise time
GPS receivers need only one GPS satellite for precise time dissemination if the
receiver is stationary on a precisely known location and the only "unknown" is its own
clock offset from GPS time and therefore from UTC.  To obtain the necessary precise
position, the receiver either receives it as an operator input or uses four satellites to
determine its own position. These receivers typically include an internal oscillator or an
optional external frequency source (rubidium or cesium). Whenever the receiver is
tracking a satellite, it generates 1, 5,  or 10 MHz reference frequencies that are
synchronized to UTC time.  If no satellites are visible, the reference frequencies are
derived from the internal or external frequency source. The receivers can provide either
stand-alone (uncoordinated) or coordinated time-transfer operations.  In SPS receivers,
use of SA will reduce the time and position accuracy available.  The manufacturers of
time transfer receivers claim time accuracies in the 20 to 50 nanoseconds range, but
this accuracy requires algorithms that average pseudorange measurements over time
(10 - 60 minutes).  A stand-alone PPS time receiver normally provides time accuracy in
the 100 nanoseconds range.  The advantage of having an external frequency source
interface designed into the receiver is that the long term error in the frequency source
can be adjusted when the receiver has satellites in view.  A stationary PPS GPS
receiver with a precise time and time interval (PTTI) interface should be able to provide
UTC to an accuracy of 50 to 60 nanoseconds.

2.5  DIFFERENTIAL GPS (DGPS) RECEIVERS

DGPS receivers are used in applications where enhanced accuracy of the PVT solution
is required or desired.  DGPS is based on the principle that receivers in the same
vicinity will see similar errors on a particular satellite ranging signal.  In general, the
DGPS technique

2-3

uses measurements from a reference receiver established at a known location,
along with differencing algorithms, to remove common satellite and signal propaga -
tion errors from the PVT solutions of other (mobile) receivers operating in the
vicinity of the reference station. The residual errors that remain uncorrected are
due to multipath and noise in the receivers. DGPS techniques can be applied to the
real-time PVT solution or to recorded measurement data.  Real-time DGPS requires
a data link  pass the reference measurements to the mobile receiver(s). DGPS
techniques can be applied to nondifferential receivers if the raw measurement data
and navigation message are accessible.  There are two primary variations of the
differential techniques, one-based on ranging-code measurements and the other
based on carrier-phase measurements.

Ranging-code DGPS (RCD) techniques can be applied to receivers with any of the
tracking architectures described in the previous paragraphs.  For RCD,
measurements from the reference receiver are used at the receiver site to calculate
corrections, which are then broadcast to the mobile receivers.  The mobile
receivers incorporate the corrections into their PVT solution, thereby removing the
common errors and improving accuracy.

The reference receiver can develop corrections for the position solution or
individual satellite ranging signals.  If the corrections are provided for the position
solution, the correction is simply the difference between the measured PVT solution
and the "true" solution consisting of the surveyed location, zero velocity, and
precise or smoothed time. However in this case, the reference and user receivers
must either use the same satellites to calculate the same solution, or PVT
corrections for each possible combination of satellites must be broadcast.  It is
usually more efficient and flexible to broadcast corrections based on individual
satellite ranging errors, thereby allowing the user receiver to select the corrections
that are applicable to the particular set of satellites that it is tracking.  Real-time
RCD is capable of producing accuracies on the order of 1 metre.
Carrier-phase DGPS (CPD) systems essentially calculate the difference between
the reference location and the user location using the difference between the
carrier phases measured at the reference receiver and the user receiver.  In real-
time systems, carrier-phase data from the reference receiver is broadcast to the
mobile receivers.  The mobile receivers use double-differencing techniques to
remove the satellite and receiver clock biases, then use the phase differences to
determine the position of the mobile receiver with respect to the reference receiver
location.
Determining the initial phase offset (cycles plus fractional phase) between the
reference station and the mobile receiver has traditionally been a process that
required several minutes.  Therefore, it is important to maintain phase-lock on the
carrier signals to maintain a continuous flow of position data and avoid
reinitialization.  Consequently, CPD systems have  traditionally used continuous
tracking receivers.  Receivers which gather measurements from more than four
satellites are common since they add robustness in the event of loss-of-lock on one
satellite and since additional satellites can reduce initialization time.  The CPD
techniques were originally developed for surveying applications where real-time
data was not essential.  However, near-real-time and real-ti me techniques are
under development with the goal of supporting applications such as precision-
approach for

2-4

aircraft, as well as the original survey applications.  Near-real-time and real-time
range implementations can achieve centimeter accuracies (fractions of a carrier
wavelength) and post-processing surveying techniques can achieve millimeter
range accuracies.  Surveying receivers are described in more detail in paragraph
2.6.

The accuracy of differential corrections developed at a single site will degrade with
distance  from  the  site  due  to  increasing  difference  between  the  reference  and
mobile receiver ephemeris, ionospheric, and tropo spheric errors.  Such systems are
usually called local area differential GPS systems (LADGPS).  The accuracy of the
corrections  can  be  extended  over  a  larger  area  by  using  a  network  of  reference
receivers to develop the corrections, and by modifying the correction algorithms in
the user receiver.  RCD systems which compensate for distance degradations are
usually called wide area differential GPS (WADGPS) systems. CPD systems which
compensate  for  distance  degradations  are  usually  called  very  long  baseline
interferometry (VLBI) systems.

CPD  techniques  (interferometry)  can  also  be  used  to  determine  platform  attitude.
In  this  case,  the  processing  can  be  contained  within  one  receiver  using  multiple
antennas.    The  distinction  is  lost  between  which  antenna  is  the  "reference"  and
which is "mobile," since all are located at fixed positions on the platform and none
are located at surveyed positions with respect to the earth.  Since the antennas are
separated by fixed distances, and since their relationship to the center-of-mass of
the  platform  is  known,  it  is  possible  to  convert  the  carrier  phase  differences  into
angular  differences  between  the  antenna  locations  and  the  line  of  sight  to  a
satellite.    By  using  measurements  from  multiple  satellites,  or  the  position  of  the
platform from a GPS position fix, these angular differ ences can then be transformed
to represent the attitude of the platform with respect to the local vertical axis.

There  are  several  standard  (and  numerous  proprietary)  broadcast  protocols,
receiver interfaces, data formats, data sets, and sets of algorithms that have been
developed  for  DGPS  applications.    Consequently  DGPS  receivers  are  typically
designed  with  a  particular  application  in  mind  and  may  not  be  suitable  for  a
different application.  Similarly, proprietary systems may not be compatible for the
same  application. 
investigated
thoroughly  and  candidate  DGPS  receivers  or  systems  should  be  evaluated  for
suitability and compatibility.

  Therefore,  DGPS  requirements  should  be 

2.6  SURVEYING RECEIVERS

Formal  surveys  are  typically  conducted  with  one  surveying  receiver  located  in  a
previously  surveyed  location  and  a  second  receiver  at  the  new  location  to  be
surveyed.    The  receiver  at  the  previously  surveyed  location  acts  as  a  DGPS
reference  receiver  and  the  receiver  at  the  new  location  acts  as  a  DGPS  "mobile"
receiver.  The "mobile" receiver is usually fixed at the new location for a period of
time  to  collect  redundant  measurements  and  further  improve  the  accuracy  of  the
survey  by  post-processing  to  remove  or  reduce  residual  errors  such  as  receiver
measurement noise.  The period of time can range from seconds to days depending
on the survey accuracy required.  Consequently, surveying

2-5

receivers  must  include  considerable  data  recording  capability.    They  may  also
include the capability to store additional information about the characteristics of the
surveyed site.
Many surveying receivers have the capability to do a "self-survey", that is, develop
a  smoothed  or  averaged  position  from  non-differential  GPS  measurements.    Non-
differential  (absolute)  surveys  require  considerably  more  time  than  DGPS  surveys
to develop the same accuracy.  However, the technique can be useful to establish a
reference point for subsequent DGPS (relative) surveys at locations where a formal
reference  point  is  inconvenient  or  unavailable.    This  capability  can  be  especially
valuable  for  tactical  military  survey  applications  where  the  relative  location  of  the
surveyed  sites  is  more  important  than  the  absolute  location  or  where  centimeter
accuracy is unnecessary.

Most  surveying  receivers  can  also  function  in  some  capacity  as  navigation
receivers, thereby providing guidance for the surveyor to previously surveyed sites.
Additional  software 
to  support  datum
transformations, post-processing, and other related survey functions.

functions  may  also  be  provided 

The  signal  processing  techniques  of  GPS  surveying  receivers  can  be  divided  into
four categories:

a. Non-differential GPS
b. Ranging-Code Differential
c. Carrier-Phase Differential (Interferometry)
d. Codeless Carrier-Phase Differential

As  described  above,  many  surveying  receivers  have  a  non-differential  GPS  mode
for navigation and self-surveys.  The signal processing techniques and accuracies
obtained  are  similar  to  other  non-differential  receivers  as  described  in  Chapter  1.
Surveying receivers may use RCD to determine an initial survey position that aids
the initialization process.  The more accurate the initial position, the more quickly
initialization  can  be  completed  for  real-time  applications.    Even  if  the  final  results
are  post-processed  to  obtain  maximum  accuracy,  real-time  outputs  can  provide
preliminary results that confirm the success of the survey in the field or enable the
surveyor  to  detect  and  correct  problems  that  may  occur.    The  primary  surveying
mode  of  most  surveying  receivers  is  CPD.    The  carrier-phase  measurements  and
algorithms  enable  centimeter  and  sub-centimeter  accuracies  in  part  due  to
significantly 
to  pseudorange
measurements.  As  in  non-differential  GPS,  iono spheric  errors  can  contribute
significant  errors.  However,  in  surveying  applications,  dual  frequency  (P-code)
measurements are almost essential to achieve surveying accuracies.  Since the P-
code  is  normally  only  available  as  the  Y-code,  most  surveying  receivers  use  a
"codeless"  technique  to  perform  ionospheric  delay  meas urements.  One  technique
uses  spectral  compressors  to  compress  the  GPS  signals  into  audio  or  subaudio
bands.  A processor is used to extract the frequency and phase of each satellite in
view.    Another  technique  is  to  split  the  received  satellite  signal  and  multiply  it  by
itself to obtain a second harmonic of the carrier phase shift which does not contain
the  code  modulation.    Codeless  tech niques  can  also  be  used  to  make  CPD
measurements  but  the  C/A-code  naviga tion  message  must  also  be  read  to  obtain
the satellite ephemeris if real-time outputs are desired.

2.7  ANALOG/DIGITAL RECEIVERS

The  majority  of  early  GPS  receiver  designs  made  extensive  use  of  analog  signal
processing  techniques,  however,  most  modern  receivers  incorporate  digital  signal
processing to replace analog receiver functions wherever possible.  The following
examples  are  provided  to  give  a  description  of  the  differences  between  these  two
design techniques.  Figure 2-1 shows a multi channel  GPS  receiver  in  which  code
correlation  is  performed  using  analog  mixing  techniques  at  the  intermediate
frequency  (IF).    Each  satellite  signal  to  be  tracked  requires  a  separate  hardware
processing  channel  which  consists  of  an  analog  correlator,  code  translator,  IF
stage,  and  base  band  converter.    The  bandwidth  of  the  IF  stage  is  designed  to
accommodate the GPS data rate and maximum carrier doppler-shifted frequency.

Figure  2-2  illustrates  a  GPS  receiver  using  a  largely  digital  architecture.    Analog
signal  processing  is  limited  to  preselection  and  gain  applied  to  the  GPS  signals
during  down  conversion  with  fixed  translation  frequencies.    The  down-converted
signals  are  digitized  through  sampling  and  are  then  ready  for  further  digital
processing.    The  digital  signal  processor  (DSP)  functions  shown  in  Figure  2-2
include correlation, code and carrier acquisition, and data recovery.

2-7

In a digital receiver, analog to digital (A/D) conversion takes place at the receiver
IF. Code correlation and further signal processing occurs digitally.  Since the input
signals  remain  code  division  multiplexed  throughout  the  front  end,  this  portion  of
the  receiver  can  accommodate  either  a  sequential  or  multiplexed 
tracking
configuration  for  any  number  of  satellites.    Thus  a  digital  receiver  can  easily  be
structured as an "all in view" receiver, whereas an analog equivalent would require
a  dedicated  hardware  correlation  channel  for  each  satellite  in  view.    The  digital
architecture  illustrated  in  Figure  2-2  also  provides  for  a  great  reduction  in
complexity  of  the  analog  portion  of  a  receiver.    This  in  turn  results  in  lower
production costs for test, calibration, and maintenance.

2.8  GPS AS A PSEUDORANGE/DELTA RANGE SENSOR

A  GPS  receiver  need  not  necessarily  be  used  as  a  PVT  sensor  in  an  integrated
navigation  system.  An  integrator  may  instead  wish  to  use  GPS  to  supply  satellite
pseudorange  and  deltarange  measurements  to  an  inte grated  positioning  solution.
Additional measurements may be provided to the integrated solution by systems or
equipment  such  as  an  Inertial  Navigation  System  (INS)  (position,  velocity,
acceleration,  attitude),  Doppler  Navigation  System  (position,  velocity),  Inertial
Aircraft  Heading  Reference  System  (velocity,  acceleration,  attitude),  or  a  Central
Air Data Computer (CADC) (baro-altitude and airspeed).  The positioning processor
can combine all the measurement data into one Kalman filter, to generate a system
positioning solution.

Such  a  solution  requires  a  sophisticated  integration  scheme.    In  order  to  use  the
pseudorange and  deltarange  data,  additional  information  is  needed  such  as
satellite  ephemeris and  GPS  receiver  clock  biases. 
  Accurate  system  and
subsystem  clocks  are  needed  to  correct  for  differences  between  the  time  the
calculations are performed and the

2-8

time  that  the  measurements  were  taken.    Alternatively,  measurements  can  be
deweighted in the integrated solution and latency errors added to the system error
budget.  If implemented correctly, a GPS sensor can still contribute to a navigation
solution when less than four satellites are being tracked.  Such a system is capable
of incorporating a single satellite measurement into the system Kalman filter, thus
bounding  the  navigation  system  solution  in  one  dimension.    The  disadvantage  of
using  GPS  as  a  sensor  in  an  integrated  positioning  solution  is  the  high  level  of
complexity involved in integrating such a system.

In  general,  stand-alone  GPS  receivers  do  not  allow  corrected  pseudorange  and
delta  range  data  out  of  the  receiver  since  it  is  classified  data.    Therefore,  some
receivers  provide  the  capability  to  process  the  integrated  solution  within  the  GPS
receiver.  Many GPS sensors are now small enough to be embedded as a card or
module into another system, such as an INS or Flight Management System (FMS).
In such cases, the corrected pseudorange and delta range data may be permitted
off the card or module since the classified data would be contained within a single
unit.  However, GPS technology now allows most of the GPS receiver functions to
be  performed  by  a  single  semiconductor  chip  or  small  chip  set.    Consequently,
future  security/processor  devices  such  as  the  Selective  Availability  Anti-Spoofing
Module  (SAASM)  may  return  to  the  "stand-alone"  architecture,  providing  the
capability to process the integrated solution aboard the device, while not allowing
the corrected pseudorange and delta range data out of the device.  For additional
discussion of GPS integration architectures and related issues, refer to Chapter 8.
For  security  design  guidelines  refer  to  Navstar  GPS  PPS  Host  Application
Equipment (HAE) Implementation Guidelines.

CHAPTER 3:  MINIMUM PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES

OF A GPS RECEIVER

3.1  BASIC CONSIDERATIONS

There  are  a  set  of  basic  performance  parameters  that  are  useful  for  making
comparisons  between different  GPS  receivers.    This  set  of  parameters,  together  with
others,  can  be  used  to determine  what  type  of  receiver  one  should  choose  for  a
particular application.  The parameters of interest are:

a. Position accuracy
b. Velocity accuracy
c. Time accuracy
d. TTFF

3.1.1  GPS System Accuracy Characteristics

There  are  a  number  of  different  ways  in  which  to  express  GPS  accuracy.  All  are
expressed in statistical terms, with a probability assigned to the value given, and the
number  of  dimensions  expressed  or  implied.    The  two  primary  positioning  accuracy
requirements  imposed  on  the  GPS  system  by  the  U.S.  DoD  are  16  metres  SEP  for
PPS, and 100 metres 95% horizontal for SPS. SEP represents a 50% probability.  Note
that  the  PPS  requirement  is  a  three-dimensional  requirement  specified  at  the  50%
probability level and the SPS requirement is a two-dimensional requirement specified at
the  95%  probability  level.    Despite  this  inconsistency,  these  are  the  parameters  and
points  on  the  accuracy  distributions  that  the  Control  Segment  has  used  to  determine
system management policies and methods.

GPS system positioning accuracy distributions are not spherical and are not Gaussian
in the tails of the distributions.  Consequently, conversions from the system accuracy
requirements  to  other  expressions  of  GPS  accuracy,  based  on  an  assumption  of  a
spherical distribution that is Gaussian in each dimension can be inaccurate, especially
at the 95% probability level which is commonly used by NATO.

"Technical  Characteristics  of  the  Navstar  GPS"  gives  conversions  of  the  PPS
positioning requirement for typical GPS system operating conditions as 37 metres 95%
spherical accuracy and 21 metres 95% horizontal accuracy.  Technical Characteristics
of the Navstar GPS also provides 95% accuracy tables to facilitate comparisons of PPS
and SPS spherical, horizontal, and vertical accuracies.

GPS exhibits statistical accuracy distributions because two important parameters
determine the accuracy of the position solution.  They are User Equivalent Range
Error (UERE) and Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP).  Both of these
parameters are variable with time.  UERE is a measure of the error in the range
measurement to each satellite as seen by the receiver.  UERE varies because of
random variations in the satellite signal, signal propagation  characteristics, and
user measurement processes.  Over the long term (days to months) UERE closely
resembles a Gaussian distribution and is equivalent for each satellite. UERE tends

3-1

to be different for each satellite at any instant in time and tends to be at a minimum
following a new navigation message upload.

GDOP  is  an  instantaneous  measure  of  the  error  contributed  by  the  geometric
relationship  of  the  satellites  as  seen  by  the  receiver.    GDOP  is  a  dimensionless
multiplicative  factor.    For  a  given  value  of  UERE,  small  GDOP  values  mean  more
precise  position  and/or  time.    GDOP  varies  because  the  satellites  are  in  constant
motion  and  their  geometric  relationships  are  constantly  changing.    Consequently
GDOP can vary with time and user location.  The "average" GDOP tends to induce
a  circular  error  distribution  in  the  horizontal  plane  with  the  vertical  contribution  of
error  approximately  1.5  times  the  horizontal  contribution.    In  real-time,  GDOP  can
be asymmetrical in the three dimensions and vary significantly from the average or
typical case, however, GDOP can be easily measured by the receiver, and is often
used  to  select  optimum  combinations  of  satellites  for  the  position  solution  or  to
develop real-time accuracy estimates.

is  defined. 

GDOP  distributions  are  not  Gaussian,  particularly  in  the  tails  of  the  distribution. 
The global distribution of GDOP can vary significantly at the 95% probability level
due  to  temporary  "vacancies"  in  the  GPS  constellation,  while  remaining  relatively
constant  at  the  50%  probability  level  where  the  GPS  PPS  system  accuracy
requirement  (16  metres  SEP) 
  Therefore,  PPS  95%  accuracy
specifications  derived  from  this  requirement  may  not  be  rigorously  maintained
through all the possible states of the GPS constellation.  However, although small
variations in accuracy performance are likely with each change in the constellation
state,  worst-case  situations  are  worst-case  for  all  users  and  by  all  measures  of
system  performance,  and  will  therefore  be  avoided  or  quickly  corrected  by  the
Control  Segment.    (Temporary  "vacancies"  in  the  satellite  constellation  can  be
expected over the life of the system due to preventive maintenance, satellite end-
of-life  failures  and  delayed  replacements,  or  random  satellite  failures  that  are
correctable by the Control Segment.)

UERE  and  GDOP  are  explained  in  more  detail  in  paragraphs  3.1.2  and  3.1.3.    It
should  be  noted  that  these  errors  are  constantly  present  as  normal  variations  in
accuracy,  even  with  a  complete  GPS  constellation  and  correctly  operating
satellites, Control Segment, and receiver.

3.1.2  GPS PPS System Range-Error Budget

The  GPS  PPS  system  range-error  budget  is  presented  in  Table  3-1.    The  budget  is
expressed for the 95% probability level of the system UERE.  This is a UERE averaged for
all satellites over a 24-hour period.  Therefore, the long-term (greater than 24 hours) one-
sigma UERE for an individual satellite can exceed this value and the system can still meet
the accuracy requirements specified in the previous paragraph.  The instantaneous UERE
of all satellites will typically exceed this value at sometime during a 24 hour period.  From
the user point of view, the important values in this error budget are those allocated to the
User  Segment.    These  are  excellent  guidelines  for  the  purchase  or  development  of
receivers  because  they  are  independent  of  the  performance  of  the  Space  and  Control
segments.

3.1.2.1  GPS UE Range-Error Budget

The portion of the UERE allocated to the Space and Control segments is called the
user range error (URE) and is defined at the phase center of the satellite antenna. 
The  portion  of the  UERE  allocated  to  the  user  equipment  is  called  the  UE  error
(UEE).  Specifically, the UERE is the root-sum-square  of  the  URE  and  UEE.    The
UEE  includes  residual  errors  after  compensation  for  atmospheric  delay,  inherent
receiver errors of noise and resolution, and multipath.  Modern C/A-code receivers
have  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in  ionospheric  delay  compensation
over  the  budgeted  values.    The  values  given  for  ionospheric  delay  compensation
error are based on dual-frequency delay measurements for P-code and the single-
frequency  ionospheric  delay  model  for  C/A-code  (as  specified  in  "Technical
Characteristics  of  the  Navstar  GPS").    The  budgeted  values  for  C/A-code  can  be
improved by use of a modified single-frequency model or code less dual-frequency
measurements on the L1 and L2 carriers.  Modern P-code and C/A-code receivers
have  both demonstrated  significant  improvements  over  the  budgeted  values  for
receiver  noise,  resolution,  and  multipath,  using  digital  phase  locking  techniques
and variable or narrow code correlation techniques.

3.1.3  Geometric Dilution of Precision

As described in paragraph 3.1.1, GDOP is a dimensionless multiplicative factor that
is an instantaneous measure of the error in the positioning solution, contributed by
the geometric relationships of the GPS satellites, as seen by the receiver.  As an
example, if two lines of position are necessary to establish a user position, the least
amount of error is present when the lines cross at right angles.  The greatest error
is present as the lines approach parallel.  (See Figure 3-1.)  Similarly, for GPS, the
greatest amount of error is present when the lines-of-sight between the user and 2
or more satellites approach parallel, or when all four satellites approach the same
plane.

Figure 3-1.  Dilution of Precision

"Technical  Characteristics  of  the  Navstar  GPS"  contains  the  mathematical  definition
and derivation of GDOP.  In short, if the one-sigma pseudorange measurement errors
for all satellites are assumed to be unity, GDOP is defined to be the square root of the
sum of the variances of the position and time error estimates.

GDOP =  (sx

2 + sy

2 + sz

2 + c2st 

2)1/2

(Where "c" is the speed of light and "t" is the user clock bias.)

GDOP  is  therefore  considered  to  relate  the  standard  deviation  of  the  satellite  range
errors  (UERE)  to  the  standard  deviation  of  the  position  solution  errors.    GDOP  is
normally considered to be unitless; the units (metres) being carried by the range error
and position solution errors.  Expressed as a mathematical formula:

sUERE x GDOP = sPOSITION SOLUTION ERROR

3-4

Other  dilution  of  precision  factors  can  be  defined  which  are  a  subset  of  GDOP  and
have a more specific physical meaning with respect to the x, y, and z axes in a local
coordinate  system.    They  include  position  dilution  of  precision  (PDOP),  horizontal
dilution of precision (HDOP), vertical dilution of precision (VDOP) and time dilution of
precision (TDOP).  Mathematically they are defined as follows:

PDOP =  (sx

2 + sy

2 + sz

2)1/2

HDOP =  (sx

2 + sy

2)1/2

VDOP =  (sz

2)1/2

TDOP =  (st

2)1/2

HDOP can be further resolved into its X and Y components.  If the X axis is oriented in
an  East-West  direction,  an  "East"  DOP  (EDOP)  and  "North"  DOP  (NDOP)  can  be
defined as follows:

EDOP =  (sx

2)1/2

NDOP =  (sy

2)1/2

Similarly, if the Y axis is oriented along the track of a moving vehicle, a "cross-track"
DOP (XDOP) and an "along-track" DOP (ADOP) can be defined:

XDOP =  (sx

2)1/2

ADOP =  (sy

2)1/2

The various elements of GDOP can also be calculated for an over-determined position
solution,  that  is,  where  the  available  satellite  or  aiding  measurements  exceed  the
required minimum of four, and an "all-in-view" solution is calculated.  The mathematical
formulations are similar, and generally result in a lower value of GDOP (hence better
solution accuracy) for each additional measurement that is added to the calculation.

GDOP  can  also  be  "weighted"  with  a  vector  of  UERE  values  in  the  matrix
calculations for real-time or short-term error estimates where the satellite (or aiding)
UERE values are not equal.  As mentioned previously, this is generally the case for
instantaneous values of UERE,  and especially true for SPS where large differences
in instantaneous UERE can be caused by Selective Availability.  This is also true
for aiding situations where the equivalent "UERE" of the aid is usually different than
the typical satellite UERE.  This "weighted" variation of DOP is an estimate of User
Navigation Error (UNE) and is sometimes termed "KDOP".  KGDOP has the same
definition as GDOP except that the statistical satellite range  errors are not required
to be equal.  Similarly there are analogous subset definitions of  KPDOP,  KHDOP,
etc.

3-5

Which DOP value may be most relevant to a particular application is dependent on the
mission and associated accuracy requirements of that mission. (K)HDOP may be most
important  for  land  and  open  ocean  navigation  where  horizontal  position  location  and
rendezvous  are  primary  mission  requirements.  (K)XDOP  and  (K)ADOP  may  be  most
important  for  air  navigation  where  aircraft  spacing  is  a  primary  safety  consideration. 
(K)PDOP  may  be  most  important  for  aircraft  weapons  delivery,  and  (K)TDOP  is
obviously  most  important  for  time  transfer  applications.    Note  that  the  DOP  values
discussed here are instantaneous estimates of the geometric contribution to error for a
particular location and time.  System accuracy requirements often require estimates of
long-term error distributions.

For  long-term  error  estimates,  the  relationship  between  range  error  and  position
solution error should be determined by computer simulation.  The standard deviation of
the  long-term  position  error  distribution  can  be  determined  by  using  the  standard
deviation of GDOP and the standard deviation of UERE, but the relationship does not
hold  true  for  other  probability  levels,  because  the  tails  of  the  GDOP  and  position
solution  distributions  are  not  Gaussian.    The  most  effective  method  for  determining
long-term  error  distributions,  for  a  particular  constellation  state  or  set  of  states,  is  by
conducting a computer simulation.

Computer  simulations  can  be  performed  to  determine  global,  regional,  or  single
location distributions, but they are often complex and time consuming.  If a Monte Carlo
simulation  is  performed  assuming  a  one-metre  standard  deviation  for  UERE,  the
resultant  normalized  position  error  (NPE)  distribution  can  be  scaled  by  any  UERE  of
interest, and examined at any probability level of interest.  The simulation can iterate
user locations around the globe and satellite orbital locations over time (24 hours) while
simulating GPS receiver calculations to determine the NPE distribution.  While NPE is
analogous  to  GDOP  in  that  it  is  a  measure  of  the  geometric  characteristics  of  error,
GDOP is an instantaneous measure and NPE is a statis tical measure.  The 95% PPS
and SPS accuracy values given in paragraph 5.1 of "Technical Characteristics of the
Navstar GPS", were determined by an NPE simulation using an optimized 21 satellite
constellation as a surrogate for the average or typical state of the GPS constellation.

It  should  be  emphasized  that  it  may  be  perfectly  valid  to  translate  user  accuracy
requirements between different dimensions and probability levels assuming a spherical
error  distribution  and  Gaussian  error  characteristics,  if  that  is  appropriate  for  the
particular  mission  or  application.    The  fact  that  GPS  accuracy  performance  is
nonspherical  and  non-Gaussian  does  not  impose  a  similar  condition  on  user
requirements.

3.2  RECEIVER POSITION ACCURACY

As  described  in  paragraph  3.1.2.1,  the  UEE  is  independent  of  the  satellite  and
Control  Segment  errors,  URE  and  receiver  position  accuracy  are  not.    Therefore,
receiver  position  accuracy  must  be  specified  for  conditions  of  DOP  and  URE,  in
order  to  isolate  the  receiver  contribution  to  position  accuracy  (e.g.,  UEE,  filtering
algorithms,  and  coordinate 
  Dynamic  positioning  accuracy
requirements  must  take  into  account  the  effect  of  vehicle  motion  on  the  filter
accuracy  as  well.    Laboratory  testing  must  control  DOP  and  URE.    Field  testing
must record DOP and URE.  In general, testing is best performed when the system

trans formations). 

3-6

positioning  accuracies  can  be  achieved.    Assuming  the  UERE  error  budget  is
maintained, this generally means DOP conditions of PDOP < 6, HDOP < 4, VDOP <
4.5, and TDOP < 2.  URE and DOP are best measured during tests by a calibrated
reference  receiver.    Computer  programs  which  use  the  broadcast  almanac  to
predict periods of favorable DOP can assist field test scheduling.  The GPS System
Effectiveness  Model  (SEM)  is  one  such  program  developed  for  the  GPS  JPO  and
has been distributed to all NATO nations.  Other similar programs are commercially
available.

3.3  RECEIVER VELOCITY ACCURACY

GPS receivers typically calculate velocity by measuring the frequency shift (Doppler
shift) of the GPS D-band carrier(s).  Velocity accuracy can be scenario dependent,
but  0.2  m/sec  per  axis  (95%)  is  achievable  for  PPS  receivers.    SPS  velocity
accuracy  is  the  same  as  PPS  when  SA  is  off.    When  SA  is  on,  SPS  velocity
accuracy  is  degraded.    The  amount  of  degra dation  of  the  velocity  is  classified. 
However, although not guaranteed, SPS velocity accuracies around 0.4 m/sec 95%
have  been  observed  by  civilian  users  for  the  typical  level  of  SA  associated  with
normal peacetime operations and 100 metres 95% horizontal position ing accuracy.

Velocity  accuracy  can  be  effectively  tested  in  a  laboratory  environment,  but  field
testing can be difficult since a tracking system with 0.05 m/sec or better accuracy is
required.    The  reader  is  urged  to  carefully  consider  the  methods  of  testing  if
velocity accuracy is an important mission requirement.

3.4  RECEIVER TIME ACCURACY

time  delays  and  uncertainties 

A dedicated PTTI port should normally be used for precise time output from a GPS
receiver.  Significant 
to
milliseconds  can  be  introduced  if  time  output  is  accomplished  via  a  digital  data
interface.  For a PPS P-code GPS receiver, tracking 4 satellites, an absolute time
accuracy  of  better  than  200  nanoseconds  (95%)  relative  to  UTC  is  possible  in  a
stationary or low-dynamic situation at an unsurveyed location.  Equivalent SPS C/A-
code  accuracy  is  340  nanoseconds  (95%).    Higher  dynamics  will  increase  time
error.  Errors in the PTTI output result from errors in the GPS receiver as well as
the Control and Space segments.  The system time transfer error budget is shown
in Table 3-2. 

from  microseconds 

Processing  errors  in  the  GPS  receiver  and  unaccounted  time  delays  to  propagate
the  timing  pulses  to  the  PTTI  port  can  add  another  60-100  nanoseconds  (95%),
depending  on  receiver  design.    Therefore,  a  total  (RSS)  time  error  of  209-224
nanoseconds (95%) can be expected.

Typical  95%  time  accuracies  expected  for  precise  time  dissemination  for  different
categories of GPS receivers are shown in Tables 3-3 and 3-4, assuming an RSS of
88 ns for the Control and Space Segment errors, and 78 ns for the PTTI error.

3-7

3.5  TIME-TO-FIRST-FIX

Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF) is a measure of the elapsed time required for a receiver to
acquire  the  satellite  signals  and  navigation  data,  and  calculate  the  first  position
solution. TTFF begins when initialization of the receiver is complete (including self-
test,  loading  of  PPS  keys,  and  any  required  operator  input)  and  the  receiver  is
commanded to begin the positioning function.  Some source material (U.S. DoD in
particular)  may  refer  to  TTFF1  and  TTFF2.    TTFF1  is  based  on  C/A-code
acquisition  with  hand  over  to  P-code  tracking.    TTFF2  is  based  on  direct  P-code
acquisition.    REAC  (reaction  time)  is  the  term  typically  used  to  include  both  the
initialization  process  and  TTFF.    Since  initialization  may  necessitate  operator
action,  REAC  specifications  or  require ments  may  require  assumptions  of  operator
response times.  TTFF is a function of the initial receiver state as well as receiver
design.    The  following  paragraphs  describe  the  satellite  acquisition  and  initial
positioning processes in more detail.

3.5.1  Warm Start, Cold Start, and Hot Start

Three different variations of TTFF are commonly defined and any one or all three
can  be  specified  or  required  for  a  particular  receiver.    A  warm  or  normal  start  is
based  on  the  assumption  that  the  receiver  has  an  estimate  of  current  time  and
position  as  well  as  a  recent  copy  of  the  satellite  almanac  data.    Typically,  time
should be known within 20 seconds of GPS time, position should be known within
100  kilometers,  velocity  within  25  metres  per  second,  and  the  satellite  almanac
should  have  been  collected  within  the  past  few  weeks.    TTFF1  for  warm  starts  is
typically in the 2 to 5.5 minute range.

A cold start occurs whenever there is a problem with these key data elements.  This
is  typical  of  a  receiver  as  delivered  from  a  manufacturer,  supply  depot,  or  repair
depot.  Date and time will not be maintained if the receiver "keep alive" battery has
been removed or drained.  If the receiver clock and memory remains active, the last
known  position  might  be  at  a  factory  or  depot  thousands  of  kilometers  from  the
present  position,  and  the  almanac  may  be  several  months  old.  Under  such
conditions, the receiver may have to systematically "search the sky" until it can find
a satellite and retrieve time and a current almanac.  A cold start can add at least
12.5 minutes to TTFF1 over that based on a warm start.

A  hot  start  occurs  when  a  receiver  is  provided  with  a  standby  feature  to  maintain
oscillator temperature, time, position, and individual satellite ephemerides (as well
as  the  almanac).  When  the  receiver  is  commanded  out  of  the  standby  mode,  the
time  required  to  achieve  the  next  full  position  fix  is  usually  Termed  Time  to
Subsequent  Fix  (TTSF)  rather  than  TTFF.    Typically,  TTSF  is  on  the  order  of  10
seconds for standby periods of a few hours.

3.5.2  Receiver Warm-Up

When  a  GPS  receiver  is  initially  turned  on,  time  must  be  allowed  for  the  receiver
crystal oscillator to warm up and stabilize at its normal operating temperature.  In a
GPS  receiver  it  typically  takes  up  to  6  minutes  to  complete  this  process.    If  the
receiver is provided with a mode that keeps the oscillator warm, this contribution to
TTFF can be avoided.

3-9

3.5.3  Almanac Collection

The first time a receiver is operated, it must perform an iterative search for the first
satellite signal unless it can be loaded with a recent satellite constellation almanac,
the approximate time and the approximate receiver location. The almanac gives the
approximate  orbit  for  each  satel lite  and  is  valid  for  long  time  periods  (up  to  180
days).  The  almanac  is  used  to  predict  satel lite  visibility  and  estimate  the  pseudo-
range to a satellite, thereby narrowing the search window for a ranging code.  Once
the  first  satellite  signal  is  acquired,  a  current  almanac  can  be  obtained  from  the
NAV msg. It takes up to 12 1/2 minutes to collect a complete almanac after initial
acquisition.  An  almanac  can  be  obtained  from  any  GPS  satellite.    Most  modern
receivers  can  update  the  almanac  periodically  and  store  the  most  recent  almanac
and  receiver  position  in  protected  memory.    A  clock  can  also  be  kept  operating
when  the  receiver  is  off  or  in  standby  mode,  so  as  to  minimize  initial  acquisition
time for the next start-up.

3.5.4  Initial Uncertainties

The  initial  uncertainties  associated  with  a  GPS  receivers  initial  position,  velocity,
acceleration, jerk and time inputs must be specified when satellite acquisition times
are  being  tested.    Acquisition  and  reacquisition  times  will  vary  depending  on  the
accuracy of the receiver initial ization. Some military TTFF requirements that include
jamming and other sensitive para meters in the start-up scenario may be classified.

3.5.5  Ephemerides Collection

Ephemeris  data  forms  part  of  the  50  Hz  NAV  msg  transmitted  from  the  GPS
satellites.  Unlike  almanac  data  which  can  be  obtained  for  the  whole  constellation
from  a  single  satellite,  ephemeris  must  be  collected  from  each  satellite  being
tracked  on  acquisition  and  at  least  once  every  hour.  Ephemeris  information  is
normally  valid  for  4  hours  from  the  time  of  transmission,  and  a  receiver  can
normally  store  up  to  8  sets  of  ephemeris  data  in  its  memory.  Acquisition  and
reacquisition times for a receiver will vary, depending on whether valid ephemeris
data  is  already  available  to  the  receiver.    When  testing  acquisition  time  it  is
necessary to specify whether a valid set of ephemerides is resident or not within the
receiver.  Depending  on  the  NAV  msg  collection  scheme  employed  in  a  particular
receiver,  it  can  take  between  30  seconds  and  3  minutes  to  collect  the  ephemeris
information.

3.5.6  Enhanced Acquisition Techniques

A  number  of  enhanced  acquisition  techniques  have  been  developed  for  modern
receivers. TTFF performance can be significantly improved by the use of multi-tap
correlators  and  multi-channel  search  algorithms. 
  Multi-tap  correlators  are
essentially  multiple  correlators  in  the  same  package  which  greatly  enlarge  each
search window for code correlation.  Similarly, using all available receiver channels
in  the  search  for  the  first  satellite  can  reduce  TTFF  by maximizing  the  effective
search window of the receiver.

3-10

3.5.7  Direct P(Y)-Code Acquisition

Direct  P(Y)-code  acquisition  can  be  effectively  achieved  using  enhanced
acquisition techniques to enlarge the search window and/or by us ing atomic clock
aiding  to  reduce  the  initial  time  uncer tainty.    Similarly,  aiding  from  an  inertial
reference system can be used to reduce the initial velocity and position uncertainty.
 Downloading initialization data from another receiver can be used for direct P(Y)-
code acquisition as well.

3.5.8  TTFF Requirements

Figure  3-2  is  a  decision  chart  for  determining  TTFF  requirements  for  the  various
initial  conditions  described  above,  as  well  as  the  TTFF1  and  TTFF2  acquisition
strategies and different receiver designs

3.5.9  Satellite Reacquisition

Satellite reacquisition assumes a temporary loss of a satellite signal due to masking
or similar loss of satellite visibility.  A satellite reacquisition time of 10 seconds or
less is typically achievable.  As described in paragraph 3.5.3, the accuracy of the
receiver  position  estimate  is  a  primary  factor  in  determining  satellite  reacquisition
time.    Vehicle  dynamics  and  elapsed  time  from  loss  of  the  signal  are  therefore
important  in  determining  the  accuracy  of  the  receiver  position  estimate,  as  is  the
presence of GPS aids such as an INS.  Laboratory testing is recommended since
these factors are difficult to control and predict in the field.

CHAPTER 4:  GPS RECEIVER INTERFACES
 AND ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT

4.1  INTRODUCTION

GPS receivers often require electrical interfaces with other components of the GPS
receiver system or with other systems in a host vehicle (HV).  Virtually all vehicle
integrations will require interfaces with HV power and an external antenna.  Many
will  require  a  crypto  key  interface  and  control-and-display  interfaces  between  an
equipment  compartment  and  a  crew  compartment.    Some  will  require  interfaces
between  a  data  loader  and  the  GPS  receiver.  Others  may  require  interfaces
between  the  GPS  receiver  and  other  navigation  systems  in  order  to  develop  an
integrated  position  solution.    In  order  to  accommodate  the  varied  requirements  of
different installations, a GPS receiver may be built with a variety of interfaces to aid
integration.  This chapter presents some thoughts on the ways of integrating GPS
with  other  systems  using  the  interfaces  specified  for  many  of  the  U.S.  DoD
receivers. These interfaces are also used by other NATO Nations and are provided
by other manufacturers, and therefore give an indication of what type of interfaces
could  be  available  in  a  military  GPS  receiver.    Examples  of  U.S.  DoD  ancillary
equipment are also provided to clarify interface uses.

4.2 GENERAL PURPOSE INTERFACES

Two  of  the  most  used  interfaces  in  a  vehicle  integration  are  the  MIL-STD-1553
multiplex  data  bus  and  the  ARINC  429  digital  information  transfer  system.    Both
interfaces can be used to interconnect a GPS receiver with a wide variety of other
equipment,  for  example,  a  control-and-display  unit  (CDU),  data  loader,  flight
instrument interface unit, or other navigation system such as an INS.

4.2.1  MIL-STD-1553 Multiplex Data Bus

Some GPS receivers are designed to communicate with other equipment via a MIL-
STD-1553  interface.    The  MIL-STD-1553  data  bus  is  commonly  used  aboard
military aircraft and can also be found aboard military ground vehicles, ships, and
missiles.    It  is  seldom  used  for  civilian  applications.    The  MIL-STD-1553  bus
operates  with  one  of  the  interconnected  equipment  units  assigned  as  a  bus
controller.  The bus controller controls the data flow on the bus in an asynchronous
command/response mode, and also transmits and receives information.  The other
units  are  connected  to  the  bus  function  as  "slaved"  remote  terminals  that  receive
and  transmit  information,  but  may  also  function  as  back-up  bus  controllers.    The
bus  controller  software  program 
for  each  unique
installation.

is  specifically  designed 

4-1

4.2.2  ARINC 429 Digital Information Transfer System

The ARINC 429 data link is commonly used in commercial as well as military aircraft.  It
is  a  single-point  to  multi-point  asynchronous  half-duplex  data  link.    That  is,  an
equipment  can  transmit  data  to  several  other  pieces  of  equipment.    Each  link  is
programmed  to  output  specific  data  formats  at  specific  data  rates.    The  ARINC  429
specification defines standard data formats and rates for data transfer between a wide
variety  of  commercial  avionics  equipment.    However,  the  GPS  data  formats  were
designed for a commercial ARINC 743A GPS/ GLONASS receiver.

4.2.3  Uses of the MIL-STD-1553 and ARINC 429 Interfaces

The  following  paragraphs  give  several  examples  of  ancillary  equipment  that  might
communicate with a GPS receiver over the MIL-STD-1553 or ARINC 429 data links.

4.2.3.1  Control and Display Unit

A CDU is often required when a GPS receiver in an equipment compartment must be
controlled remotely from a crew compartment.  The CDU allows the operator to enter
initialization  data  and  control  parameters,  display  status  and  position  data,  and  can
provide access to related functions, such as, waypoint navigation functions.  Examples
of two types of CDUs procured by the U.S. DoD are discussed below to clarify typical
CDU capabilities.

The  U.S.  DoD  has  procured  dedicated  CDUs  as  well  as  multifunction  CDUs.    A
dedicated CDU (or "dumb" CDU) is essentially a remote control and display panel that
possesses  no  processing  capability,  relying  on  the  GPS  receiver  for  all  computation
functions.  A multifunction CDU (or "smart" CDU) is designed to control a GPS receiver,
perform  other  navigation  or  control  functions,  and  may  interface  with  additional
navigation  equipment  as  well.    The  multifunction  CDU  includes  onboard  processing
capability  for  functions,  such  as,  calculating  a  composite  positioning  solution  using
GPS and other navigation sensors, or performing the waypoint navigation function.

4.2.3.1.1  Dedicated CDU

A view of the front panel of a dedicated CDU with a sample display is shown in Figure
4-1. The CDU has a four line, 13 character display controlled by two rotary switches,
four line select keys, a display freeze key (Mark), a waypoint mode key, a page slew
key,  and  an  alphanumeric  keypad.    The  MODE  switch  selects  the  receiver  operating
mode,  the  DATA  switch  selects  which  parameters  are  to  be  displayed,  and  the
keyboard is used to make parameter entries.

In  addition  to  the  basic  position,  velocity,  and  time  displays,  the  CDU  also  provides
status information on various display pages.  Some of this information is the external
interface configuration, satellite tracking status, estimated position error, age of satellite
almanac, PTTI 1 pulse per second time difference, and the Built-In-Test (BIT) fault log
data.  Control functions

include  the  selection  of  the  lever  arm  source,  flight  instrument  interface  mode,  and
aiding sensor control.

4.2.3.1.2  Multiple Dedicated CDU Operation

Control  and  display  for  a  GPS  receiver  may  involve  more  than  one  dedicated  CDU. 
The design of a GPS receiver may incorporate two dedicated CDU interfaces and may
also  provide  a  data  link  interface  (e.g.,  MIL-STD-1553)  that  can  also  be  utilized  for
control  and  display.    However,  only  one  interface  should  be  able  to  control  and
manually initialize a GPS receiver at any given time.  A master CDU can be designated
by a software configuration connector strap as either a data bus or one of the dedicated
CDUs.  The master CDU is initially the "active" CDU when the receiver is powered up
and may always regain control from another CDU if it has relinquished control to that
unit.  A designator indicating the current active CDU should be stored in non-volatile
memory so that it will not change as a result of a accidental power outage.  The active
CDU has the sole responsibility for control and manual initialization and thus has sole
responsibility for the following:




Receiver Mode Commands
Rendezvous Mode Selection

 Waypoint Activation

Destination Selection
 Waypoint Definition
 Mark Definition




 Map Datum Selection


Desired Track/Desired Vertical Angle Selection
Altitude Hold Activation
Stationary Mode Activation
Flight Instrument Scaling

Acquisition Uncertainty Selection

4.2.3.1.3  Multifunction CDU

A  view  of  the  front  panel  of  a  multifunction  CDU,  with  a  sample  display,  is  shown  in
Figure 4-2. The CDU has an eight line, 22 character display controlled by standard and
special function keys, full alphanumeric keypad, and eight line select keys.  The CDU
utilizes a menu driven approach for control, display, and data entry in lieu of the rotary
switches of the dedicated CDU.

Figure 4-2.  Example of a Multifunction CDU

The CDU includes enhanced area navigation software and a dual-redundant MIL-STD-
1553  data  bus.    It  is  capable  of  operating  as  either  a  bus  controller,  backup  bus
controller, or remote terminal.  The CDU can act as the MIL-STD-1553 bus controller
and exchange data with the following equipment:

4-4

Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS)
Central Air Data Computer (CADC)

 GPS Receiver


 Mission Data Loader (MDL)


Two Additional CDU Systems

4.2.3.1.4  Multiple Multifunction CDU Operation

The CDU MIL-STD-1553 bus logic can be designed to support an installation of two or
more  CDUs.    In  multiple  CDU  operations,  one  CDU  is  the  bus  controller  and  the
other(s) are remote terminals and backup bus controllers.  If the active bus controller
fails,  then  another  CDU  becomes  the  bus  controller  and  no  degradation  in  system
performance occurs.  The CDU can be designed such that in multi-CDU installations,
any CDU can become the "active" CDU and all can have independent control of data
display.

4.2.3.2  Data Loader System

A  GPS  receiver  (and/or  multifunction  CDU)  may  have  the  capability  to  load  relevant
data over a data link from a Data Loader System (DLS).  The primary func tion of the
interface is to provide the ability to input initialization data from an external nonvolatile
memory  device.  This  is  almost  essential  for  GPS  avionics  systems  that  must  be
compatible with civil aviation and use a large International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) standard waypoint and navaid data base.  A data loader may also be useful for
storing navigation, status, or mission data collected during a mission.  The DLS may be
used to store and load the following:

 Waypoints and Flight Plans
 GPS Satellite Almanac Data
 GPS Satellite Health/Status Data





Antenna Lever Arm Data
Instrumentation Port Parameters
SA/A-S Data
Sensor Configuration Data

An example data loader system is shown in Figure 4-3.  The system consists of a
memory  device  and  a  read/write/interface  unit.    The  example  memory  device  is  a
plug-in  cartridge  that contains  solid  state  memory,  memory  addressing  circuitry,
serial  input/output  converters,  and  an  alkaline  cell  to  power  the  memory  for  data
retention  purposes.    Other  memory  devices  such  as  magnetic  tape  cassettes  and
computer  diskettes  are  also  common.    The  read/write/interface  unit  is  installed  in
the HV and often resembles a small tape deck in size and appearance.  It contains
the appropriate circuitry to read from and write to the memory device, and contains
interface circuitry to send and receive data from the data link (e.g., MIL-STD-1553
or ARINC 429).

4.2.3.3  Flight Instrument Interface Unit

Some GPS receiver designs will pass analog signals direct ly to the flight instruments,
but  many  designs  may  have  a  digital-only  output  via  an  ARINC  429  interface.    The
reason for a digital-only design is the anticipation of all-digital flight instruments in the
future.  Aircraft with analog flight instru ments may require a separate digital-to-analog
converter to convert the digital data to the synchro, analog and discrete signals needed
to drive these instruments.

As  an  example,  the  Signal  Data  Converter  (SDC)  unit,  developed  for  the  U.S.  DoD,
performs  this  function.    In  concept,  the  SDC  process  is  simple;  the  SDC  takes  the
digital ARINC 429 data stream and converts those parameters to analog signals that
can be handled by analog flight instruments.  Not all of the parameters can be used
(e.g. waypoint, latitude, and longitude) since the analog flight instruments have no way
of  processing  or  displaying  such  data.    Data  which  can  be  used  by  analog  flight
instruments include:

Distance to Waypoint


 Waypoint Bearing





Desired Track (or radial)
Vertical/Horizontal Deviation From Selected Track (2-D or 3-D)
Data Validity Discretes
To/From Indication

The use of GPS for navigation in a mili tary aircraft is often seen as a substitute for
the Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) system.  Therefore, it may be desirable to use
TACAN procedures with GPS, and it may also be desirable for the GPS displays to
emulate the TACAN displays.  The SDC includes the capability to function as a
TACAN digital-to-analog converter by means of a simple discrete switch.  This
provides a simplified method

4-6

for GPS access to the analog flight instruments, using the existing TACAN wiring
path (i.e., replace the existing TACAN D-to-A with the SDC).

Since GPS is still a relatively new system, some of the TACAN system characteristics
need  to  be  considered.    Identified  below  are  GPS  flight  instrument  display  and
procedures comparisons to TACAN and other radio navigation aids.

4.2.3.3.1  Deviation Scale Factor

With TACAN, a 2-dot horizontal deviation displacement represents 10 degrees off the
required  radial.    An  Instrument  Landing  System  (ILS)  Localizer  has  a  2-dot
displacement of approximately 3 degrees (runway dependent).  In the case of the U.S.
DoD equipment, the GPS 2-dot displacement represents either 4 nmi, 1 nmi, 0.3 nmi
linear  displacement,  or  3  degrees  depending  on  the  scale  factor  selected  (Enroute,
Terminal, Nonprecision Approach, or Approach respectively).

These GPS horizontal scale factors were generally derived from airway track keeping
requirements  for  the  various  phases  of  flight.    The  Enroute  scale  factor  was  derived
from  the  typical  4  nmi  U.S.  National  Air  Space  (NAS)  Airway  width.    The  Terminal
scale  factor  was  selected  based  on  U.S.  Air  Force  Instrument  Flight  Center  flight
testing.    The  Non-Precision  Approach  scale  factor  corresponds  with  U.S.  FAA  non-
precision  approach  tolerance.    The  Approach  scale  factor  simulates  an  ILS  localizer
display.

If  3-dimensional  waypoints  are  used,  then  the  U.S.  DoD  GPS  receiver  can  present
vertical deviation information.  The vertical 2-dot deflections are 1000 ft, 500 ft and 200
ft linear displacement, and 0.7 degrees corresponding to the En Route, Terminal, Non-
Precision Approach, and Approach scale factors respectively.  The linear scale factors
provide  the  opportunity  to  someday  utilize  GPS  for  vertical  navigation  in  level  flight. 
The Approach vertical scale factor simulates an ILS glideslope display.

4.2.3.3.2  TACAN and GPS Flight Procedural Differences

In the TO/FROM TACAN Navigation mode, the Omni Bearing Select (OBS) knob on
the  Horizontal  Situation  Indicator  (HSI)  allows  the  pilot  to  select  the  radial  (to  or
from the current waypoint) along which he wishes to fly.  As the knob is turned and
the radial changes, the horizontal deviation bar swings to show the pilot whether he
is left or right of that radial.  In the case of TACAN, the OBS knob feeds back to the
TACAN  Digital-to-Analog  Converter  (DAC),  where  the  left/right  computation  is
carried  out  (see  Figure  4-4).    The  deviation  bar  is  driven  by  angular  differences. 
The U.S. DoD SDC can mimic the TACAN DAC as shown in Figure 4-4.

4-7

Figure 4-4.  Flight Instruments and TACAN

In  the  case  of  U.S.  DoD  GPS  receivers  using  GPS  TO/FROM  Navigation  mode,  the
receiver is programmed with waypoint information which includes desired track.  This
can  be  analogous  to  selected  TACAN  station  (waypoint)  and  OBS  radial  setting
(desired track).  The deviation bar deflection will be a function of linear distance (when
not  in  approach  mode)  of  the  aircraft  perpendicular  to  the  desired  track  which  was
programmed in the receiver (see Figure 4-5).  The SDC provides a desired track output
synchro signal that can drive the HSI OBS to the appropriate radial setting.  The pilot,
however, can not turn the OBS knob to select a new GPS desired track (other similar
products  may  choose  to  incorporate  the  OBS  knob  setting).    The  pilot  wishing  to
change the desired track value must enter it into the CDU.  The pilot alternatively can
select the Direct-To navigation function to get a direct course to the waypoint.

Pilots generally steer magnetic headings.  GPS is an inher ently "true" system.  One
must therefore be careful that the SDC always has a designated magnetic or true
heading source and the GPS receiver has knowledge of local magnetic variation, or
assigned magnetic variation (in the case of Navaids used as waypoints).

4.2.3.4  Inertial Navigation Systems

A  GPS  receiver  integrated  with  an  Inertial  Navigation  Systems  (INS)  forms  a
particularly  effective  navigation  system.    The  GPS  receiver  can  compensate  for  the
long-term  drift  of  an  INS  and  an  INS  can  compensate  for  the  short-term  noise  and
relatively low data rate of a GPS receiver.  (Additional discussion of GPS integration
architectures is provided in Chapter 8).

4.3  PRECISE TIME AND TIME INTERVAL INTERFACE
4.3.1  Introduction

GPS is becoming recognized as the primary time dissemination system for military and
commercial  applications.    An  example  of  a  system  which  may  use  time  transfer  from
GPS is the calibration of atomic clocks.

4.3.2  Precise Time Inputs

A time input is used to reduce the uncertainty of the receivers initial time estimate and
thus reduce TTFF, or it may be used instead of a satellite in the navigation solution. 
The  precise  time  input  to  a  GPS  receiver  is  accomplished  by  using  a  1  pulse  per
second rate representing UTC one-second-rollover and a Binary Code Decimal (BCD)
time code describing the pulse per second time from an atomic clock.  The pulse input
indicates the moment of the time to UTC, and the BCD time code identifies what time it
was at the UTC one-second-rollover.

The MIL-STD-1553 PTTI Input Message time transfer mechanism uses the same time
rollover pulse input.  However, instead of labe ling the time with a BCD time input, the
HV supplies a PTTI input message via the MIL-STD-1553 MUX bus to label the time
epoch.

4.3.3  Precise Time Outputs

The primary function of these outputs is to calibrate an atomic clock, or to support
other systems that require precise time.  The outputs are 1 pulse per second or 1
pulse per minute to indicate the one second or one minute rollover of UTC, and a
BCD  time  code  that  indicates the  time  at  the  rollover  epoch  (Hours,  Minutes,
Seconds, Day of Year, Time Figure  of Merit (TFOM)).

4-9

Another means of precise time transfer from the GPS receiver is to use the 1 pulse per
second output in conjunction with the PTTI output message available on the MIL-STD-
1553 multiplex bus.

4.4  ROLL/PITCH/HEADING/WATER-SPEED ANALOG INPUT INTERFACE

A shipborne receiver should be able to accept analog inputs of the ship's attitude and
water speed in coarse and fine synchro for mat.  The heading input signal can be used
by  the  receiver  to  assist  in  satellite  acquisition  and  tracking,  and  for  relative  course
calculations.  The roll/pitch input signal can be used by the receiver to compensate for
antenna motion.  The water speed input signal can be used by the receiver to aid in
satellite acquisition and tracking, and for relative speed calcu lations.

4.5  INSTRUMENTATION PORT INTERFACE

GPS  receivers  typically  have  an  interface  for  testing  during  development  and
manufacturing. If the configuration of this interface is documented and controlled, it
may be useful for integration purposes.  Several U.S. DoD GPS receivers have an
instrumentation port interface.   This interface can be used for some HV integration
applications  and  for  connection  of  test  equipment  used  by  maintenance  and  test
activities.    The  interface  is  a  full  duplex  RS-422  serial  interface  that  can  be  con -
nected  to  a  Smart  Buffer  Box  for  test  instrumentation  purposes,  or  to  an
Intermediate Level Test Set for maintenance purposes.

4.6  RS-232 INTERFACE

RS-232 is a common interface typically used to interface between computer equipment.
 The PLGR includes a RS-232 2-way serial port.  This port provides the  capability  to
control the PLGR remotely, and to transfer data between PLGRs or between  a PLGR
and a computer.  This interface can also be used for reprogramming PLGR  operational
software.

4.7  BAROMETRIC ALTIMETER INTERFACE

A  variety  of  barometric  altimeter  devices  output  digitally-encoded  pressure  altitude,
referenced to the geoid or Mean Sea Level (MSL), with a pressure reference of 1013.2
hectoPascals  (formerly  millibars).    This  is  the  same  encoded  altitude  as  is  used  in
Mode  C  altitude  reporting  via  an  air  traffic  control  radar  beacon  (IFF  transponder). 
Some U.S. DoD GPS receivers have a compatible baro-altimeter input.  It is a parallel
interface  which  consists  of  ten  signal  leads  and  one  signal  return.    The  seven  most
significant bits are a Gray Code representation of the barometric alti tude in feet, to the
nearest 500 feet.  The three least signifi cant bits are a binary code which indicates the
100 foot increment within the 500 foot interval.

4.8  GPS INTERFACE OPTIONS

4.8.1  Introduction

Choice  of  interfaces  for  a  GPS  receiver  are  dependent  on  the  system  to  which  a  GPS
receiver  shall  be  integrated,  and  are  also  dependent  on  the  depth  of  the  integration
required.  Alternative approaches to interfaces can be grouped as follows:





Implement a new interface in an existing GPS receiver
Redesign of HV systems to accommodate an existing GPS receiver
Development  of  an  interface  box  to  adapt  an  existing  GPS  receiver  to  an
existing HV system.

4.8.2  Implementing a New Interface in an Existing GPS Receiver

Good design of a GPS receiver allows the partitioning of the receiver portion and
the  interface requirements.    Often  this  can  be  accom plished  by  using  a  separate
processor  to  manage  interfaces,  thus  buffering  the  performance  of  the  GPS
receiver portion from the individual demands of a platform interface.  This gives the
ability  to  add  new  interfaces  with  minimum  impact  on  the  majority  of  receiver
software  design.    Given  the  flexibility  of  the  software  design,  an  existing  GPS
receiver  can  have  a  new  interface  card  inserted  into  a  spare  card  slot,  or  if  an
existing interface is not used, then the new interface card can be substituted for it. 
This  choice  is  constrained  by  the  hardware  limitations  of  wiring,  output  pin
availability, etc.

4.8.3  Redesign of HV Interfaces to Accommodate an Existing GPS Receiver

Redesign  of  the  HV  interfaces  to  accommodate  the  GPS  receiver  with  its  current
interface  is  a  possibility;  however,  it  may  not  be  considered  practical  unless  major
components  of  the  HV  can  be  changed  at  the  same  time.    With  GPS  becoming
available  as  a  sensor  (rather  than  an  LRU  with  interfaces),  embedded  GPS  receiver
alternatives (e.g., embedded in an INS) should also be considered when systems are
being replaced.

4.8.4  Separate Development of an Interface Box

One approach that can have minimal impact on both an existing GPS receiver and
HV systems is the design of a separate "box" that performs the interface functions. 
This "box" would accept existing interface inputs and outputs of a GPS receiver and
convert  them  to  the inputs  and  outputs  normally  used  by  the  HV  systems.    This
approach still requires the HV  system's  software  to  be  changed  to  accept  another
navigation input, and the issues of space, weight, and power for the new "box" must
be addressed.  Of importance is the impact on the data senescence caused by the
additional time delay necessary for the "box" to convert  the data.

CHAPTER 5:  ANTENNA SUBSYSTEMS

5.1  INTRODUCTION

GPS users have different requirements for GPS system performance which demand a
variety  of  antennas  and  antenna  subsystems.    There  are  three  basic  types  of  GPS
antennas,  a  passive  Fixed  Radiation  Pattern  Antenna  (FRPA),  a  FRPA  with  an
integrated  preamplifier,  and  a  Controlled  Radiation  Pattern  Antenna  (CRPA).    The
requirement  to  drive  a  long  cable  run,  with  its  associated  signal  loss  between  the
antenna and the GPS receiver  has resulted in  a FRPA with an integrated amplifier.  A
CRPA is required to reduce  the effects of RF interference which would otherwise jam
the receiver's operation.

5.2  FRPA

5.2.1  General Characteristics

A FRPA has a fixed antenna radiation pattern which is only affected by the size and
shape  of    the  ground  plane  on  which  it  is  installed.    As  GPS  antennas  are  typically
narrow band the radiation pattern does not change over either the L1 or L2 bandwidth
although due to the difference between the L1 and L2 wavelength there are significant
differences in the radiation at the L1 and L2 frequencies.

Typical  specifications  for  FRPAs  include  parameters  for  operating  frequencies,
impedance, Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR), radiation pattern, polarization, axial
ratio and gain. These specifications impact receiver performance.  The size, shape and
weight of the FRPAs will vary with the application.  A FRPA for an aircraft installation
has a different form than a FRPA for a hand-held receiver.  A number of FRPAs are
discussed  below.    FRPAs  are  generally  non -repairable  units  which  require  no
adjustment  over  their  lifetime.    Passive  FRPAs  require  no  power.    All  FRPAs  can  be
fitted  with  an  external  low  noise  amplifier  should  this  be  needed  to  overcome  losses
introduced by a long cable length.  The amplifier will probably require a low power DC
voltage.

An  important  parameter  when  selecting  a  GPS  antenna  is  the  gain.    Gain  is  defined
with respect to an isotropic radiator for circular polarization,  expressed as dBic, and
the  sector  of  the  sphere  surrounding  the  antenna  over  which  the  gain  can  be
maintained, expressed as the angle from the antenna boresight.  (The boresight is the
central axis of the antenna usually the direction of maximum gain).

To receive the signals from GPS satellites, which may be at any angle in the upper
hemisphere, the gain must not drop below -5  dBic.  In the case of an aircraft there
is a significant problem of maintaining sufficient gain towards the satellites as the
aircraft  maneuvers  through  high  angles  of  pitch  and  roll.    Typically  an  aircraft's
GPS antenna gain falls to -15 dBic below the azimuth plane, although a worst case
gain of -20 dBic can be assumed.

5-1

5.2.2  FRPA  Types

There are many types of GPS FRPA antenna.  The simplest is a resonant monopole
approximately  5  cms  in  length.    However,  as  the  monopole  has  a  toroidal  radiation
pattern and is vertically polarized, it is not optimum for use with the circularly polarized
GPS  transmissions.  Gain  is  very  low,  -40  dBic  on  boresight  and  peaking  to
approximately 0 dBic at 70 from boresight depending on the conductivity of the ground
plane. 

Spiral  Helix  antennas  are  useful  for  several  receiver  applications  where  a  small
antenna  is  required  that  is  generally  unaffected  by  the  presence  or  absence  of  a
ground plane.  The antenna can be configured to be low profile, but is not conformal
and  is  therefore  not  suitable  for  fast  aircraft.    The  antenna  is  less  sensitive  to  the
influence of the ground plane than some other FRPAs and is capable of being mounted
on  non-conducting  surfaces,  making  it  suitable  for  a  variety  of  applications  from
vehicles to handheld receivers.  Typically the gain is better than  -4 dBic from boresight
to 80.  The antenna's mechanical layout and typical dimensions are shown in Figure 5-
1.

The FRPA Bifilar Helix is designed for hand-held applications and is capable of being
integrated into a broad category of ground vehicles in addition to its main application
on  the  Precise  Lightweight  GPS  Receiver  (PLGR).    The  antenna  is  insensitive  to
ground plane and installation location.  Streamlined outer shell can be added to enable
the  device  to  be  used  in  medium  dynamic,  for  instance  helicopter  applications.    It
provides a gain of not less than - 3 dBic over 80 angle from boresight.  The antenna 's
mechanical layout and typical dimensions are shown in Figure 5-2.

To produce a conformal design for aircraft applications where minimal drag is required,
a  crossed  slot  or  patch  antenna  can  be  used.    The  crossed  slot  is    effectively  four
monopoles laid out at right angles with a suitable separation above the ground plane. 
Patches can take many formats.  These antennas rely on the aircraft skin acting as a
ground  plane  to  achieve  the  required  antenna  performance.    Gains  of  +2  dBic  are
typically achieved on boresight and, although the gain to circularly polarized radiation
falls  to  -5  dBic  at  90  (from  boresight),  the  gain  is  sufficient  to  allow  satellites  to  be
tracked through medium dynamic aircraft maneuvers. Antennas can be made that are
sensitive to L1 and L2 GPS frequencies.  The mechanical layout and the dimensions of
an example antenna are shown in Figure 5-3.

A  special  derivative  of  a  FRPA  crossed  monopoles  antenna  is  the  FRPA  Ground
Plane. This special FRPA assembly (see Figure 5-4) is intended  for shipborne mast
applications  where  there  is  no  ground  plane.    The  assembly  consists  of  a  ground
plane/mounting  surface  for  the  FRPA  plus  an  environmentally  sealed  enclosure
containing  an  integrated  preamplifier.  A  derivation  of  the  FRPA  Ground  Plane  is
employed  for  GPS  Reference  Stations  in  a  differential  system.    In  these
applications a special choke ring is added to the antenna to reduce the gain in the
direction of likely sources of multipath.

5.3  CRPA  Equipment

CRPAs have been shown to be the only effective means of protecting GPS receivers
against multiple wideband jammers.  A CRPA has two components: an Antenna Control
Unit  (ACU)  and  an  antenna  array.    Current  aircraft  CRPA's  typically  have  seven
antenna  elements  in  the  array  with  seven  associated  processing  channels.    CRPAs
under development for missile may use only four or five elements.

The antenna array is composed of antenna elements which may be of any of the above
FRPA types.  However the vehicle environment significantly limits the choice.  In the
case  of    aircraft  the  array  has  to  be  conformal  and  is  therefore  usually  made  up  of
patch or crossed dipole antennas.  The antenna elements are spaced at approximately
half wavelength separation, at the shortest operational wavelength.  It is essential for
optimum  operation  of  the  CRPA  that  all  the  antenna  elements  in  the  array  have
omnidirectional performance with constant gain characteristics over as large a sector
as possible.

The ACU controls the array's radiation pattern by adjusting the gains and phase from
each antenna.  First generation ACU employed analogue electronics with some digital
control. Newer equipment digitizes the receiver signal in a similar manner to that used
in a GPS receiver.  The ACU contains a series of amplifiers and gain control systems
for each channel, a set of weights that make up a beam former and a microprocessor
and associated electronics that contains the control algorithm and drive the weights in
the beamformer.  Each weight is a phase shifter with gain control. The phase shift was
initially performed by analogue components but it is now cost effective to employ digital
multiplier  circuits.    The  receiver  signal  is  downconverted  to  near  baseband  and
sampled into inphase and quadrature components.  By adjusting the gain and sign of
each component a 360 degree range is achieved.

As  the  GPS  signal  is  below  the  thermal  noise  in  the  transmission  bandwidth,  any
signal  detected  above  the  thermal  noise  level  can  be  considered  to  be  harmful  to
GPS  operation.  Initially  the  array's  radiation  pattern  is  set  to  omnidirectional,  by

5-4

adjusting the gain and phase in the ACU.  Whenever a jamming signal is detected,
the  gain  and  phase  of  the  beamformer  is  adjusted  to  form  a  null  in  the  radiation
pattern  in  the  direction  of  the  jammer  with  the  result  to  cancel  the  effect  of  the
jammer.

A CRPA has one less degree of freedom than the number of elements (N), allowing N-1
independent jamming sources to be cancelled.

CHAPTER 6:  SERVICE COVERAGE, SERVICE AVAILABILITY,
AND SERVICE RELIABILITY; SATELLITE SELECTION
CRITERIA AND FIGURE OF MERIT DESCRIPTION

6.1  SERVICE COVERAGE, SERVICE AVAILABILITY, AND SERVICE RELIABILITY

This  section  describes  the  minimum  performance  an  authorized  user  can  expect  to
obtain  from PPS  receiver  which  is  designed  and  operated  in  accordance  with
"Technical Characteristics of the Navstar GPS".  Performance is specified in terms of
minimum  performance  standards  for  each  performance  parameter.    Each  standard
includes a definition of applicable conditions and constraints.  The information provided
in  this  section  is  derived  and extracted  from  "The  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)
SPS Performance Specification", dated November 5, 1993, published by the U.S. DoD.
Although  the  GPS  SPS  Performance  Specification  is  directed  toward  SPS  users  of
GPS, the specified performance of the system with respect to service coverage, service
availability, and service reliability is the same for PPS users.

The  data  and  associated  statements  provided  in  this  chapter  represent  conservative
performance  expectations,  based  upon  extensive  observations  of  the  system.    The
performance standards are limited to GPS Control Segment and Satellite contributions

The standards do not include enhancements or degradations to this service that might
be  provided  by  the  UE  or  local  environment.    Examples  of  possible  enhancements
include  altitude  aiding,  clock  aiding,  differential  corrections,  or  integrity  algorithms.
Examples  of  possible  local  degradations  include  multipath,  jamming,  terrain  masking,
or receiver errors.

6.1.1  Parameter Definitions

The  three  parameters  defined  below  are  service  coverage,  service  availability,  and
service  reliability.  These  definitions  and  the  relationships  between  them  are  different
from traditional definitions of similar parameters.  A dependent relationship is defined to
exist between these performance parameters.  Each successive layer of performance
definitions  are  conditioned  on  the  preceding  layers.    That  is,  coverage  must  be
provided  before  the  service  may  be  considered  available  and  it  must  be  available
before it can support service reliability requirements.

Service coverage is defined as the percentage of time over a specified interval that a
sufficient  number  of  satellites  are  above  a  specified  mask  angle  and  provide  an
acceptable position solution geometry at any point on or near the earth.

GPS  coverage  is  viewed  somewhat  differently  than  coverage  for  existing  terrestrial
positioning  systems.    Traditionally  coverage  has  been  viewed  as  the  surface  area  or
volume in which a system may be operated.  Since a terrestrial system's beacons are
fixed, coverage does not change as a function of time.  Since the GPS concept relies
upon  the  dynamics  of  a  satellite  constellation, coverage must take into consideration a
time dependency.  GPS coverage is by definition intended to be global.  GPS coverage is
viewed alternatively as the percentage of time over a time interval that a user, anywhere in

6-1

the world and at any time, can see a sufficient number of satellites to generate a position
solution.    Constraints  are  placed upon  satellite  visibility  in  terms  of  mask  angle  and
geometry,  to  minimize  the  possibility of  a  GPS  receiver  generating  a  marginal  position
solution.  Coverage  characteristics over  any  given  region  vary  slightly  over  time,  due
primarily to small shifts in satellite orbits.

Since  GPS  is  a  space-based  system,  coverage  is  defined  as  a  function  of  each
satellite's  antenna  beamwidth.    The  GPS  satellite  antenna's  nominal  beamwidth  is
approximately  28  degrees.    If  a  user  on  the  Earth's  surface  were  to  view  a  satellite
which  is  just  above  the  local  horizon,  the  user  could  elevate  from  that  location  to  an
altitude  of  approximately  200  kilometers  above  the  Earth's  surface  before  effectively
losing  that  satellite's  signal.    This  condition  defines  the  maximum  altitude  associated
with the term "on or near the Earth."

Service availability is defined as the percentage of time over a specified time interval
that a sufficient number of satellites are transmitting a usable ranging signal within view
of any point on or near the earth, given that coverage is provided.

Just because a satellite is operational does not mean that it is currently transmitting a
usable GPS ranging signal.  Satellites will, on occasion, be removed temporarily from
service  for  routine  maintenance.    As  a  result,  the  number  of  satellites  actually
transmitting  usable  ranging  signals  will  vary  over  time.    Service  availability  is  the
measure of how GPS coverage deviates from nominal conditions due to the temporary
removal  of  satellites  from  service.    This  measurement  represents  the  percentage  of
time that coverage is provided by those satellites which are transmit ting usable ranging
signals to generate a position solution.  Variations in service availability are a function
of  which  satellites  are  removed  from  service,  the  length  of  the  service  outage,  and
where on the globe a user is located in relation to any resulting outage patterns.

Service reliability is defined as the percentage of time over a specified time interval that
the instantaneous predictable horizontal error is maintained within the normal accuracy
distribution at any point on or near the earth, given that coverage is provided and the
service is available.

GPS  can  be  used  anywhere  in  the  world.    A  failure  in  a  system  with  such  global
coverage may affect a large percentage of the globe.  A natural concern about using
GPS  is  whether  or not it  provides  a  satisfactory  level  of  service  reliability.    Service
reliability as it is used in a GPS context is somewhat more restrictive than the classical
definition,  which  includes  times  that  the  service  is  available  as  well  as  when  it  is
performing within specified tolerances.   GPS service reliability is viewed as a measure
only  of  how  well  GPS  maintains  horizontal  errors  within  the  normal  predictable  PPS
horizontal  accuracy  distribution.    100%  service  reliability  is  provided  when  the
horizontal  error  remains  within  the  normal  accuracy  distribution  within  the  conditions
specified  for  coverage  and  service  availability.  Periods  where  the  service  does  not
provide  a  sufficient  number  of  satellites  or  adequate  geometry  to  support  position
solution generation are assessed against the coverage service availability performance
standard.
6.1.2  Service Coverage Characteristics

6-2

This section defines the GPS coverage standards, GPS constellation design objectives,
and  the  characteristics  of  GPS  coverage  which  are  expected  with  a  24  satellite
operational constellation. The user is provided with general information concerning how
coverage will vary over time on a global basis, and a worst-case projection of coverage
on  a  regional  basis.    The  data  provided  in  the  discussion  is  based  upon  a  global
assessment  of  grid  points  spaced  equally,  approximately  111  kilometers  apart,  every
30 seconds over a 24 hour period.

6.1.2.1  Service Coverage Standards

GPS Service will be provided in accordance with the coverage standards presented in
Table 6-1.

6.1.2.2  The GPS 24-Satellite Constellation

The  24  satellite  constellation  is  designed  to  optimize  global  coverage  over  a  wide
range  of  operational  conditions.    Specific  constellation  design  objectives  are  listed
below:

 Provide  continuous  global  coverage  with  specified  geometry  and  mask  angle

constraints.

 Minimize coverage sensitivity to expected satellite orbital drift characteristics.

 Mitigate  the  effects  on  service  availability  of  removing  any  one  satellite  from

service.

Several factors affect GPS coverage.  These factors must be taken into consideration
in the constellation design.  The factors are:

6-3

 The difference between the planned orbit and the orbit actually achieved during

the launch and orbit insertion process,

 Orbit variation dynamics, and

 Frequency and efficiency of satellite station-keeping maneuvers.

6.1.2.3  Expected Service Coverage Characteristics

Proper  support  of  the  first  design  objective  (from  above)  requires  that  at  least  four
satellites  are  continuously  in  view  with  an  acceptable  geometry  and  mask  angle
anywhere  in  the  world.    An  implication  of  this  requirement  is  that  most  of  the  time
significantly  more  than  four  satellites  will  be  visible.    As  shown  in  Figure  6-1,  eight
satellites will be visible on average for any location in the world, over 24 hours.  Very
seldom will a user see only four satellites when all 24 satellites are providing usable
ranging signals.  If the 24 satellites in the GPS constellation were all launched with no
deviations into their planned orbits, and no drift were allowed, the constella tion would
provide virtually 100% (0.99999714) four satellite coverage with a PDOP constraint of
six.

Figure 6-1.  Satellite Global Visibility Profile

Unfortunately,  variations  in  final  orbits  based  upon  launch  uncertainties  and  routine
drift do occur. The second design objective is supported by evaluating how changes in
each  satellite's orbital  elements  affect  nominal  coverage  characteristics.    Bounds  are
applied to orbital element deviation from the nominal orbit to ensure that constellation
coverage does not degrade beyond allowed limits. Degraded coverage areas drift and
change slightly in shape over time, but their average number and duration will remain
approximately constant for a given constellation.  Changes in the number of satellites
or significant shifts in satellite orbits,  however, can dramatically change the attributes of
degraded coverage areas.

6-4

Given  a  24  satellite  constellation,  GPS  will  provide  100%  four  and  five  satellite
coverage  without  a  PDOP  constraint  (but  with  a  mask  angle  of  5  degrees),  and  six
satellite coverage greater than 99.9% of the time.  However, four satellite coverage with
a PDOP constraint of 6 can drop as low as 99.9%, with a worst-case dispersion of the
24  satellites  with  respect  to  their  nominal  orbits.    Even  in  this  event,  most  users  will
experience  continuous  coverage.    A  few  isolated  locations  may  experience  four-
satellite coverage as low as 96.9%, with a PDOP constraint of 6 and a mask angle of 5
degrees.

Satisfaction  of  the  third  design  objective  requires  the  ability  to  remove  any  individual
satellite from the constellation, and still be able to provide as close to continuous global
coverage  as  is  practical.  Satisfaction  of  this  objective  requires  that  at  least  five
satellites be in view almost continuously.  As shown in Figure 6-1, this is the case with
the  24  satellite  constellation  design.    Although  an  explicit  requirement  is  not
established to ensure that multiple combinations of satellites provide adequate solution
geometry  at  any  given  time,  most  of  the  time  at  least  two  and  usually  more
combinations  of  four  satellites  will  support  a  Position  Dilution  of  Precision  (PDOP)
constraint of 6 or less.

6.1.3  Service Availability Characteristics

This section defines the GPS availability standards and expected regional and global
service  availability  characteristics.    The  user  is  provided  with  information  concerning
GPS  service  availability  patterns  on  a  global  and  regional  basis.    Service  availability
varies slightly over time, due to routine satellite maintenance requirements.  Note that
the  regional  service  availability  values  provided  below  are  based  upon  a  global  grid
point spacing of approximately 111 x 111 kilometers, with 30 second intervals over 24
hours.

Service availability is described in two basic parts.  The first part concerns the variation
in  service  availability  as  a  function  of  temporarily  removing  a  number  and  specific
combination  of  satellites  from  service.    The  second  part  of  the  assessment  applies
service availability variation characteristics to an operational scenario.

6.1.3.1  Service Availability Standards

GPS service will be provided in accordance with the availability standards specified in
Table 6-2.

6.1.3.2  Satellite Outage Effects on Service Availability

Service availability varies predominantly as a function of the number and distribution of
satellite service  outages.    With  a  24  satellite  constellation,  the  permutations  and
combinations of satellite  service  outages  are  rather  large.    Normally,  no  more  than
three  satellites will  be  removed  from  service  over  any  24  hour  interval.    This  ground
rule bounds the problem to an analysis of the effects of removing each satellite and all
combinations of two and three satellites from service for no more than 24 hours.  The
results of the analysis are summarized in Table 6-3.

6.1.3.3  Expected Service Availability Characteristics

Table  6-3  defines  what  service  availability  characteristics  will  be  like  for  a  given
satellite outage condition.  Service availability projections over time may be generated
by  applying  the  information  in  Table  6-3  to  expected  satellite  control  operations
scenarios.    A  satellite  control  operations  scenario  is  based  upon  a  conservative
estimate  of  satellite  maintenance  activity 
  Satellite
maintenance  actions  requiring  service  downtime  include  periodic  cesium  frequency
standard maintenance, station keeping maneuvers to maintain orbits within tolerances,
and responses to component failures.  Given current routine maintenance requirements
and component failure expectations, generally three, and no more than four satellites
should be removed from service over any 30 day period.  Once a satellite is removed
from service, it is assumed that it will be down for no more than 24 hours.

frequency  and  duration. 

The first service availability scenario to be defined represents a worst-case 30 day
period. A summary of this scenario is provided in Table 6-4.  The scenario is
considered to be worst case from two perspectives:  it includes a day with three
satellites removed from service, and it includes a total of four satellite-down days.  The
three satellite-down scenario is based upon the simultaneous removal of two satellites
for routine maintenance, accompanied with a component failure on a third satellite.
Worst case global service availability  on a day with three satellites removed from
service is 95.87%; the associated worst case regional service availability is 83.92%.
The resulting 30-day service availability values  range from 99.85% to 99.99%,
depending on which satellites make up the four which

The  second  service  availability  scenario  is  shown  in  Table  6-5,  and  represents  what
may  be  considered  to  be  a  more  common  30  day  interval.    In  this  scenario,  three
satellites  were  removed from  service  for  up  to  24  hours,  each  on  separate  days.

means that the removal of two satellites for maintenance at the same time will be a rare
occurrence.

6.1.4  Service Reliability Characteristics

This section defines conservative expectations for GPS service reliability performance.
These  expectations  are  based  upon  observed  accuracy  characteristics,  the  GPS
service  failure  history  to  date,  long-term  failure  rate  projections,  and  current  system
failure  response  capabilities.    The  user  is  provided  with  information  which  indicates
expected failure rates and their effects on a global and regional basis.

6.1.4.2  GPS Service Failure Characteristics

A  GPS  service  failure  is  defined  as  an  excursion  of  unpredictable  magnitude  of  the
horizontal position solution due to a control segment or satellite fault which is unrelated
to  the  normal  predictable  long-term  PPS  horizontal  accuracy  distribution.    A  GPS
service failure is characterized by a large single-satellite range error which is unrelated
to the normal long-term PPS range error distribution.

The characteristics of a service failure and the factors which affect service reliability are
listed below.  Each is discussed in more detail in the following sections.








Ranging signal failure frequency
Failure duration
Failure magnitude and behavior
Distribution of user population around the globe
Probability that the failed satellite is used in the position solution
Effect that the failure has on the position solution, given the failed satellite's
contribution  to  solution  geometry  and  the  receiver's  response  to  the  failure
condition.

6.1.4.3  Failure Frequency Estimate

The  GPS  satellite  positioning  service  failure  history  over  the  past  several  years
indicates a very low service failure rate (excluding Block I satellites).  However, when a
service  failure  does  occur,  it  can  result  in  extremely  large  position  and/or  velocity
errors.  This behavior will typically persist until action is taken to remedy the problem.

Based upon an historical assessment of Block II satellite and Control Segment failure
characteristics, GPS should experience no more than three major service failures per
year  (excluding  Block  I  satellites).    This  failure  rate  estimate  is  conservative  -
expectations  are  on  the  order  of  one  per  year,  based  upon  projected  navigation
payload component reliabilities and the assumption that action will be taken to switch
redundancy configurations if early indications of an imminent failure are detected.  An
allocation  of  three  per  year  allows  for  a  possible  increase  in  service  failures  as  the
Block II satellites reach the end of their operational life expectancy.

6.1.4.4  Failure Duration Estimate

The duration of a failure is a function of the following factors:




Control Segment monitor station coverage
Control Segment monitor station, communications and Master Control Station
availability

 Master Control Station failure detection efficiency and timeline


Timeline for correcting the problem or terminating the failed satellite's service.

6-9

The combination of these factors results in a conservative system operator response
timeline on the order of no more than six hours.  In most cases the response to a failure
will be much more prompt, but with any complex system such as the Control Segment,
allowances  must  be  made  for  varying  system  resource  status  and  operational
conditions.

6.1.4.5  Failure Magnitude and Behavior

GPS is designed to be fault tolerant - most potential failures are either caught before
they manifest themselves, or their effects are compensated for by the system.  The only
failures to which the system seems susceptible are of two types:





Insidious, long-term (day or more to become evident) performance deviations,
or
Catastrophic, almost instantaneous failures

Insidious  failures  do  not  propagate  very  quickly  -  failures  of  this  type  experienced  to
date  have  not  affected  the  GPS  ability  to  support  accuracy  performance  standards.
Insidious  failures  are  typically  due  to  a  problem  in  the  ephemeris  state  estimation
process.

Catastrophic  failures  are  due  almost  exclusively  to  satellite  frequency  generation
hardware failures. These failures in general result in very rapid ranging error growth -
range  errors  can  grow  to  several  thousand  metres  in  a  very  short  period  of  time.
Typically, a failure of this type will begin with a phase jump of indeterminate magnitude,
followed by a large ramp or increased noise consistent with the behavior of a quartz
oscillator.

6.1.4.6  User Global Distribution and Failure Visibility

For the purposes of reliability performance standard definition, the effect of a service
failure  is  not  weighted  based  upon  user  distribution  -  a  uniform  distribution  of  users
over the globe is assumed.

Given  a  maximum  failure  duration  of  six  hours,  approximately  63%  of  the  Earth's
surface will have a failed satellite in view for some portion of the failure.  The average
amount of time that the failed satellite will be in view for those locations which can see
it is approximately three hours.

6.1.4.7  Satellite Use in the Position Solution

Given a 24 satellite constellation, an average of eight satellites will be in view of any
user on or near the Earth.  The satellite visibility distribution for the nominal 24 satellite
constellation is shown in Figure 6-1.  With all satellites weighted equally, the probability
of a failed satellite being in the position solution of any user located within the failure
visibility region is 50%.  Equal weighting is considered to be a reasonable assumption
for  use  in  global reliability  computations.    However,  in  the  worst-case  individual  site
computation  it  must be  assumed  that  the  receiver  is  tracking  and  using  the  failed
satellite for the duration of  the satellite visibility window.

6-10

6.1.4.8  Failure Effect on Position Solution

Given the nature of catastrophic failures, it must be assumed that the inclusion of the
satellite  in  the  position  solution  will  induce  a  service  reliability  failure  independent  of
the satellite's geometric contribution.  Some receivers will be capable of detecting and
rejecting  large  instantaneous  changes  in  a  range  residual  which  are  indicative  of  a
major service failure.  The minimum  receiver represented in the Signal Specification is
not  however,  required  to  have  this  capability.    For  the  purposes  of  service  reliability
standard definition, it must be assumed that if the receiver is capable of tracking the
failed satellite and it supports the nominal position solution geometry, the receiver will
use it in the position solution.

6.1.4.9  Expected Service Reliability Characteristics

When the system is performing nominally and the receiver design meets the minimum
usage  conditions  established  in  Section  2.2  of  the  Signal  Specification,  predictable
horizontal error will never reach the service reliability threshold.  Service reliability on
those days where GPS does not experience a major service failure will be 100%.

The  estimated  maximum  of  three  major  service  failures  per  year,  coupled  with  a
maximum duration of six hours each, yields a maximum of 18 service failure hours per
year.  The worst-case site on the globe will be the place where all 18 service failure
hours are observed and the failed satellites are used in the position solution.  For this
worst case condition, the daily average service reliability over a one year period will be
no  worse  than  99.79%.    The  equivalent  global  daily  average  will  be  no  worse  than
99.97%.

6.1.5  Additional Commentary

(The following commentary is not derived from the GPS SPS Performance Stan dard.)
It  should  be  noted  that  several  criteria  used  as  conditions  and  constraints  in  the
performance standards may not be applicable to many user applications.  As examples,
the coverage standard is based upon 24 operational satellites, a four-satellite position
solution,  a  PDOP  of  6  or  less,  and  a  5  degree  mask  angle;  the  service  availability
standard is based on a "normal" operating scenario; and the service reliability standard
is based on the assumption that the user does not perform integrity checking.

6.1.5.1  24 Operational Satellites and Service Availability

The assumption of 24 operational satellites may be optimistic rather than conservative.
In the long term, the GPS constellation will be in a continuous cycle of satellite end-of-
life failures and corresponding launch of replacements.  It is expected that three to four
satellites will reach  end-of-life  each  year,  based  on  experience  with  the  Block  I
satellites and considering design improvements to the Block II satellites.  This means
that service coverage can change every few months, although end-of-life failures can
be  anticipated  to  some  degree  and  some  launches  can  be  made  prior  to  the  actual
failure.    A  number  of  studies  have  been  conducted  to  determine  the  probability  of  a
specific  number  of  satellites  in  service  at  any  given  time,  including  some  studies
conducted for the U.S. DoD to help determine  satellite replenishment strategies.  One

6-11

such  study  gives  the  long-term  probabilities  for  the  number  of  GPS  satellites
operational any given time.

In most cases, a satellite vacancy from the full constellation of 24 satellites will result in
reduced  service  coverage.    For  convenience,  the  lack  of  a  four  satellite  positioning
solution  or  a  condition  where  PDOP  >  6  will  be  termed  an  "outage".    In  general,  the
number of outages, individual durations of outages, and areas affected by outages will
increase with each additional vacancy from the constellation.  As long as the U.S. can
maintain 21 or more satellites on orbit, and worst-case situations can be avoided, the
service coverage is likely to remain between 99% and 100%.  Table 6-8 below gives
some  representative  values  of  service  coverage  for  a  24-Satellite  constellation  with
"typical"  deviations  from  the  nominal  orbit  positions.    During  the  worst-case  three-
satellite-failure condition, the worst location in the world may experience as low as 86%
average positioning availability over a 24 hour period, while the best location may still
experience 100% availability.

As suggested above, there are several options the U.S. DoD may employ to minimize
the impact of reduced service coverage.  Such options include launches in anticipation
of  satellite end-of-life  failures,  planning  normal  maintenance  to  minimize  service
availability impact, deferring normal maintenance, and even minor rephasing of certain
satellites in the constellation.  In this respect, the standards quoted above for service
availability under "normal" operating conditions have some flexibility to compensate for
reduced service coverage and still maintain a high composite availability of a position
solution.

6.1.5.2  PDOP Less Than Six

PPS users are much less sensitive to large values of DOP than SPS users.  Many PPS
users will have sufficient position accuracy using GPS as a stand-alone system even if
PDOP  is  greater  than  six.    For  example,  for  navigation  missions,  horizontal  position
accuracy  is  usually  a  more  appropriate  measure  than  PDOP.    As  a  general  rule  of
thumb,  a  PDOP  of  six  is  typically  equivalent  to  an  HDOP  of  four  (although  PDOP
obviously  contains  a  vertical  component  which  can  vary).    This  means  that  an
approximate worst case PPS error for "normal" horizontal variations would be around
160  metres  (assuming  a  three-sigma  URE  of  20  for  all  satellites  and  a  maximum
geometric effect of 2 X HDOP = 8).  Many PPS users of GPS can navigate safely with a
horizontal position accuracy of a kilometer or more, for example, ships in open ocean
and aircraft enroute at altitude, and can therefore tolerate much higher values of HDOP
(and PDOP).  Therefore, "areas of reduced accuracy" is often a more appropriate term
than "outage" for conditions of large PDOP, since the accuracy of the position solution
may be reduced but still adequate for the mission requirements.

This suggests that the user should evaluate the performance standards with respect to
the  anticipated  mission  requirements.    If  the  mission  requirements  are  significantly
different  than  the  constraints  used  to  develop  the  performance  standards,  an
independent  assessment  of  service  coverage  via  computer  simulations  may  be
warranted.  One method of determining the real-time effect of prevailing range errors
and satellite geometry is calculation of a FOM described in paragraph 6.3 below.  The
user  can  then  reduce  the  uncertainty  associated  with  global  averages  and  long-term
statistics  by  comparing  the  current  accuracy  estimate  to  the  mission  accuracy
requirements  and  thereby  significantly  improve  the  probability  of  success  of  the
mission.

Most military GPS users will have to contend with the possibility of GPS "outages," due
to  hostile  local  conditions,  for  example,  terrain  masking  or  intentional  jamming.    One
solution  for  some  applications  is  an  integrated  navigation  system.    For  example,  if  a
GPS receiver is integrated with an inertial navigation unit, an intermittent GPS solution
can  be  sufficient  to  maintain  continuous  high-accuracy  positioning.    For  other
applications, vertical aiding can be used as a pseudo-satellite to enhance availability,
or differential GPS can be used to minimize range errors and correspondingly reduce
sensitivity to DOP.

6.1.5.3  Four-Satellite Solution and Five-Degree Mask Angle

In  effect,  the  performance  standards  are  based  on  a  "model"  GPS  receiver  that
calculates a four-satellite PVT solution and is constrained by a five-degree mask angle.
In  evaluating  the impacts  of  these  constraints,  the  user  must  consider  the  type  of
equipment that he is actually employing. Significant gains in service coverage can be
achieved by the use of aiding, for example, from an altitude source or precision clock.
Similarly,  significant  gains  in service  coverage  can  be  expected  if  the  satellite  mask
angle  actually  implemented  by  the  receiver  and  GPS  antenna  is  lower  than  five
degrees.  Correspondingly, a higher mask angle

6-13

will reduce service coverage.  In the event that the actual receiver differs significantly
from the "model" receiver used to develop the standards, an independent assessment
of service coverage may be advisable by means of computer simulations.

6.1.5.4  Integrity Checking

The service reliability concept defined here is closely related to the NATO concept of
integrity. Consequently, user equipment that employs integrity checking algorithms may
be  able  to  detect  the  majority  of  "service  failures"  and  continue  to  maintain  a  valid
position solution by choosing a set of satellites which excludes the one experiencing
the service failure.  Various integrity monitoring algorithms have been developed by the
civil  aviation  community  which  are  well  documented  in  open  technical  literature,  and
most  receiver  manufacturers  are  familiar  with  them.    Most  of  these  algorithms  are
based  on  the  principle  of  a  consistency  check  using  additional  range  measurements
and developing multiple solutions for comparison purposes (aiding measurements can
be  included).  However,  when  such  algorithms  are  employed,  a  minimum  of  five
measurements  are  usually  required,  rather  than  the  four  required  for  a  minimum
position solution.  Therefore, the overall system availability is likely to be determined by
the  availability  of  the  integrity  decision,  rather  than  the  availability  of  the  navigation
solution.    Fortunately,  the  availability  of  an  integrity  decision  based  on  PPS
measurements  is  extremely  high,  since  PPS  is  not  subject  to  SA  "noise"  which  can
make  SPS  integrity  decisions  more  difficult.    Table  6-9  gives  some  results  for  the
availability of an integrity decision from a recent study of a PPS integrity algorithm for
military aviation which included pressure altimeter aiding.  The results are based on a
five-degree mask angle and a 556 metre position error threshold, suitable to protect the
accuracy required for a nonprecision approach. The probability of detecting a service
failure for this algorithm is 0.999, which when multiplied by the probability of occurrence
of a service failure yields an overall level of integrity in excess of 0.99999.

Again, an assessment of the mission requirements is warranted to determine the
integrity threshold, probability of residual "service failures", and duration of integrity
"outages" that can be tolerated.  For example, an application that involves safety of life
may require that a position solution be declared invalid unless a positive confirmation
of integrity is achieved. In contrast, a weapons delivery system might allow the position
solution to be valid unless a negative assertion of integrity is determined, with the
residual loss of integrity considered

6-14

a minor overall detriment to weapon effectiveness when compared to the alternative
loss of weapon availability.

6.1.5.5  Summary of the Commentary

If there are significant differences from the "model" receiver implied by the performance
standards,  different  constraints  applicable  to  the  application,  or  different  mission
requirements,  an  independent  assessment  of  the  performance  standards  or  similar
parameters  is  probably  warranted  via  computer  simulation.    In  addition,  real-time
integrity  checking  and  calculation  of  a  figure-of-merit  can  significantly  reduce  the
uncertainty associated with global averages and long-term statistics, and significantly
improve the probability of success of a given military mission.

6.2  Satellite Selection Criteria

6.2.1  Introduction

The  criteria  used  for  satellite  selection  is  a  very  important  factor  in  GPS  receiver
design.  Different receivers perform satellite selection using different algorithms.  The
important satellite criteria to be considered include:

a. Satellite health
b. Geometric dilution of precision
c. User range accuracy
d. Elevation angle
e. Availability of external aids.

6.2.2  Satellite Health

The  NAV  msg  contains  satellite  health  information  for  all  the  satellites  in  the  GPS
satellite  constellation.    Each  satellite  broadcasts  health  summaries  for  all  (up  to  32)
GPS  satellites,  in  page  25  of  subframes  4  and  5.    Each  summary  consists  of  1  bit
indicating  the  health  of  the  NAV  msg  and  5  bits  indicating  the  health  of  the  satellite
signals.  (Refer to "Technical Characteristics of the Navstar GPS" or ICD-GPS-200PR
for  additional  details).    A  satellite  should  never  be  used  in  a  Nav-solution  if  its  Nav-
message is indicated to be unhealthy.  If the NAV msg health is good, the five-bit signal
status message should be compared against valid operating modes for the receiver to
determine  if  the  satellite  can  be  used.    For  example,  a  P-code  receiver  could  use  a
satellite  broadcasting  L1  only,  if  an  ionospheric  model  can  be    used  instead  of  dual
frequency measurements to make the ionospheric corrections.

The NAV msg also contains a health message in subframe 1 which indicates the health
of  the broadcasting  satellite.    Since  the  data  in  subframes  4  and  5  are  updated  less
frequently  than subframe  1,  subframe  1  may  be  used  to  indicate  short-term  health
problems or may be updated before subframes 4 and 5.  Therefore, after a satellite is
acquired,  the  health  data  in subframe  1  should  also  be  checked  to  deter mine  if  the
satellite can be used.

6-15

6.2.3  Geometric Dilution of Precision

As  described  previously  in  Chapters  2  and  3,  GDOP  is  an  important  factor  in
determining  the  accuracy  of  the  position  (or  time)  solution.    The  combination  of
satellites  which  gives  the  lowest  DOP  value  will  provide  the  most  accurate  solution,
assuming that all satellites have the same pseudorange error.  Depending on the user
mission, best PDOP, HDOP, or TDOP can be used as a satellite selection criterion.

6.2.4  User Range Accuracy

Each satellite broadcasts a user range accuracy (URA) value in subframe 1 of the NAV
msg.    URA  is  a  prediction  of  the  pseudorange  accuracy  obtainable  from  the  satellite
signal in space.  URA is based on recent historical data and is therefore most accurate
immediately following an upload.  It does not include the UEE and therefore does not
include ionospheric compensation error if the ionospheric model is used instead of dual
frequency  measurements.    These  additional  errors  should  be  added  to  URA  for  the
best  estimate  of  pseudorange  accuracy,  especially  if  the  receiver  is  capable  of
performing  dual  frequency  measurements  on  some  satellites  and  must  use  an
ionospheric model for others.  (Refer to "Technical Characteristics of the Navstar GPS"
or  ICD-GPS-200PR  for  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  URA.)    URA  can  be  used  in
conjunction with DOP to choose the best combination of satellites when the satellites
have  significantly  different  pseudorange  errors.    This  is  done  by  using  URA  as  a
weighting factor in the covariance matrix for user position and clock bias errors.  Since
URA is a prediction, it is not a guarantee of range accuracy, however, it can be used to
help deselect satellites with known large pseudorange errors.

6.2.5  Satellite Elevation Angle

Selecting satellites by computing a minimum DOP will favor the use of satellites at low
elevation angles.  However, signals from satellites at a low elevation angle must travel
a  longer  distance  through  the  ionosphere  and  troposphere  than  signals  from  higher
angles.  They will therefore incur additional pseudorange error due to ionospheric and
tropospheric delay.  Many receivers will not use satellites below an arbitrary elevation
angle.    Five  degrees  is  a  typical  lower  limit.    This  also  helps  to  reduce  multipath
problems.

6.2.6  External Aids

When an external aid is available to the GPS receiver, it can be incorporated into the
satellite selection algorithm.  It can be incorporated as a fixed mode of operation, an
optional mode of operation when only three satellites are visible, or it can be treated as
an additional "satellite" to be selected when the best combination of satellites includes
the aid. Decision logic for the first two cases is relatively simple.  If the aid is treated as
an additional satellite, the expected error and geometry must be modelled and included
in the satellite selection algorithm.  For example, mean sea level (MSL) aiding can be
considered to be equivalent to a satellite at the center of the earth with a UERE on the
order of a typical satellite (6-7 metres).  Other aiding schemes can be more complex,
depending on the complexity of the integration, error model, and equivalent geometry.
Barometric altimeter

6-16

aiding should be treated with extra caution.  Barometric altimeters are excellent devices
for measuring pressure altitude, but pressure altitude can vary widely and non-linearly
from geometric altitude.  The resulting vertical errors should be modeled carefully since
the errors can depend on meteorological conditions and vehicle dynamics.  For
additional discussion of GPS aids, refer to Chapter 7.

6.3  FIGURE OF MERIT (FOM)

A FOM is an indicator of receiver positioning or time accuracy which may be displayed
to  the  operator  or  communicated  to  an  integrated  system.    A  FOM  may  be  either  a
qualitative or quantitative measure, depending on the accuracy and integrity of the data
used  to  calculate  the  FOM.    In  general,  a  FOM  is  not  suitable  for  making  integrity
decisions  where  safety  of  life  is  concerned.    However,  a  qualitative  FOM  may  be
perfectly  suitable  for  integrity  decisions  regarding  unmanned  missions.  (Refer  to
Chapter 12 for additional discussion of integrity.)

A  FOM  is  typically  calculated  as  the  root-sum-square  of  the  estimated  errors
contributing to the solution accuracy.  Example criteria include:

a. GPS receiver state (e.g., carrier tracking, code tracking, acquisition)
b. Carrier to noise ratio
c. Satellite geometry (DOP value)
d. Satellite range accuracy (URA value)
e. Ionospheric measurement or modelling error
f. Receiver aiding used
g. Kalman filter error estimates.

The resultant FOM can be presented as a numerical value, for example from 1 to 9,
where 1 indicates the best navigation performance.  It can also be presented directly as
an  error  estimate  in  metres,  at  a  specified  probability  level,  or  even  as  a  simple
pass/fail indication. A time figure of merit (TFOM) can also be calculated to indicate the
quality  of  the  precise  time  information  available  from  the  GPS  receiver  via  the  PTTI
interface  (see  paragraph  4.3.3).    Table  6-10  gives  the  FOM  and  TFOM  numerical
assignments  and  equivalent  estimated  errors  for  the  Rockwell-Collins  family  of
receivers developed for the GPS JPO.

CHAPTER 7:  AIDING OPTIONS FOR A GPS RECEIVER

7.1  TYPES OF AIDING

Aiding  a  GPS  receiver  is  done  by  incorporating  inputs  from  external  sources  and  is
performed to enhance the following operations:

a. Acquisition of initial satellite signals,
b. Translate  the  navigation  solution  to  a  position  in  the  HV  other  than  the  GPS

c. Replace  a  satellite  measurement  in  case  of  limited  visibility  or  bad  satellite

antenna,

geometry,

d. Maintain  satellite  tracking  by  increasing  the  tolerance  of  the  GPS  receiver  to

interference, jamming or high HV dynamics.

Figure 7-1 illustrates some options.  It should be noted that these are options and that not
all GPS receivers presently have the capabilities described.

7.2  AIDING DURING INITIAL ACQUISITION

7.2.1  Position and Velocity Aiding

When a GPS receiver is first initialized for operation, approximate position and velocity of
the receiver are required to minimize satellite acquisition time.  The accuracy requirement
of the U.S. DoD program for position is < 100 km of actual receiver location, and for velocity
is  <  100  m/s  of  actual  receiver  velocity,  to  ensure  that  satellite  acquisition  is  within
specification.

7.2.2  Time Aiding

Time aiding can be used during the initialization process, similar to position and velocity
data.  The time accuracy requirement is < 20 seconds relative to UTC.  This is to ensure
that satellite acquisition time is within specification.

Time  aiding,  if  sufficiently  accurate,  can  also  be  used  to  enable  a  direct  P(Y) -code
acquisition without first acquiring the C/A -code.  This type of time aiding is relevant to  HVs
such  as  submarines  where  minimum  exposure  time  of  the  GPS  antenna  on  the  ocean
surface  is  of  prime  importance.    An  atomic  time  standard  is  one  way  to  enable  direct
P(Y)-code acquisition.

7.2.3  Almanac Data

Normal satellite acquisition requires the availability of a current satellite almanac, stored in
the receiver memory.  If there are no significant changes in the satellite constellation, then
the almanac is valid for several weeks. 

If no stored or valid satellite almanac data are available, the GPS receiver starts to search
the sky attempting to locate and lock onto any satellite in view.  Depending on the receiver
search  strategy  and  on  the  actual  satellite  constellation,  this  process  may  take  15 -60
minutes.  When  one  satellite  is  being  tracked,  the  receiver  can  download  and  read  the
almanac information about all the other satellites in the constellation.

7.2.4  Effect On TTFF

Dependent on the type of integration (position, velocity and time) aiding data to the GPS
receiver during the initialization process are provided as follows:

a. Manually by the operator via the GPS CDU or HV CDU,
b. Automatically from INS/AHRS, PTTI or the HV mission computer (via 1553 -bus),
c. Default by using the shut-down values stored in the receiver memory.

Initial acquisition performance can be expressed by the TTFF.  In general terms, the TTFF
is the time from when the receiver attempts to track the satellite signals until a navigation
solution is determined.  Knowing the position and velocity of the receiver, current time, and
the positions of the satellites will all help to reduce the TTFF.  Conversely, a lack o f

7-2

reasonably accurate knowledge of any of these parameters will increase the TTFF.  The
amount of increase is dependent on the particular quantity and level of uncertainty.

7.3  AIDING TO TRANSLATE NAVIGATION SOLUTION

The navigation solution of an unaided GPS receiver is referenced to its antenna position. 
An  aided  GPS  receiver  can  reference  its  navigation  solution  to  another  location.  For
example, the GPS navigation state can be resolved at the IMU instrument axes center in
the  case  of  an  INS.    To  perform  the  calculations,  the  receiver  needs  to  be  aided  with
attitude information and a lever arm vector.

The attitude information in the form of roll, pitch and heading is provided in most cases by
an INS or AHRS.  A GPS receiver usually does all internal calculations in ECEF before
carrying out any coordinate transformations.  Using latitude and longitude in conjunction
with attitude, the transformation between the GPS ECEF navigation frame and the HV body
frame can be determined.  Onboard ships, attitude aiding is also used to compensate for
antenna  motion  and,  together  with  water  speed  information,  to  do  relative  course  and
speed calculations.

A lever arm vector is provided to the GPS receiver as a vector between the GPS antenna
and  the  HV  reference  point.    If  attitude  aiding  is  removed  from  the  GPS  receiver,  the
navigation solution should revert back to the GPS antenna location.  Often, more than one
set  of  lever  arm  corrections  may  be  stored  in  the  GPS  receiver.    This  is  useful  for
installations having more than one INS aiding source or, in the case of big ships, where
position  and/or  velocity  information  for  different  locations  onboard  may  be  of  interest. 
However, only one attitude aiding source should be used by the GPS receiver at any one
time.  Hence the propagated navigation solution will only incorporate the one set of lever
arm corrections applicable to the particular aiding source that is providing aiding data to the
GPS receiver.  Should the aiding source be changed, the lever arm corrections will change
accordingly.

7.4  AIDING TO REPLACE A SATELLITE MEASUREMENT

During normal receiver operations, four satellite measurements are required inputs to solve
the equations for position (Ux, Uy, Uz) and clock offset Dt.  In case of limited satellite visibility
or  poor  satellite  geometry,  one  or  more  of  the  four  satellite  inputs  may  be  replaced  by
inputs from an external aiding source.

When the GPS receiver is shipborne, or has barometric altimeter aiding or has a known
height, then only three satellites are needed.  Additional aiding by a precise clock can
supplement the measurements in a two-satellite situation. 

7-3

7.4.1  Clock Aiding

A GPS receiver uses its own internal clock or may use a more accurate external clock as
time reference.  If only three (instead of four) satellites are available, then the GPS receiver
can assume that its time reference is correct ( Dt  =  known)  and  treat  the  three  available
satellite range measurements as actual ranges instead of  pseudoranges.  In this case, the
accuracy of the position derived from the  pseudorange measurements will correspond to
the equivalent time reference error.

If the GPS receiver clock or the external clock can be monitored during a previous period in
which the receiver navigates with four satellites, then the clock phase bias and drift can be
calculated.  The resulting corrections for clock errors can be used to provide very accurate
GPS time during a satellite outage and an accurate GPS position can be maintained for
several minutes.

The  method  of  using  a  clock  instead  of  a  satellite  is  not  recommended  as  a  permanent
solution,  but  rather  to  help  the  GPS  receiver  operate  during  short  periods  when  only  a
limited set of satellites is available.  A GPS receiver should be capable of receiving (and
providing) precise time via a dedicated PTTI interface or via the 1553 -bus.

7.4.2  Altitude Aiding

Similar to the clock aiding discussed in the previous paragraph, an airborne GPS receiver
can use a barometric altimeter as aiding to replace a satellite measurement.  Long-term
altimeter  errors  are  calibrated  during  periods  of  four  satellite  operation.    Subsequently,
when less than four satellites are being tracked, the calibrated  baro-altimeter data are used
as a known Uz-value in the 4 unknowns of (Ux, Uy, Uz) and Dt.  Conceptually, the barometric
altitude  added  to  the  earth  radius  provides  a  range  measurement  from  a  satellite  with
position at the center of the earth.  An accurate GPS position can be maintained for as long
as  the  estimated  baro  altitude  errors  are  valid.  Since  the  barometric  altitude  errors  are
generally  slowly  varying,  both  in  time  and  distance,  reasonable  position  accuracy  can
usually be maintained for 10-15 minutes, or within a radius of roughly 10  nmi of the position
of the last 4 satellite solution.  A gradual loss of position accuracy, especially in the vertical
channel,  can  be  expected.    Depending  on  the  algorithm  used  to  compute  altitude  from
pressure,  the  loss  of  accuracy  may  be  hastened  by  altitude  changes  in  a  nonstandard
atmosphere, particularly if no temperature compensation is used.

7.5  AIDING TO MAINTAIN SATELLITE TRACK

In normal receiver operation, the code and carrier tracking loops are both being tracked
in phase lock.  There is a symbiosis between the code and carrier tracking loops where
each  loop aids  the  other.    In  a  high  jamming  environment,  the  receiver  may  lose  its
ability to track the carrier.  Subsequent accelerations will cause the carrier frequency of
the received GPS signal to vary due to a change in the Doppler  shift.  The Doppler shift
of the frequency of the received carrier signal is proportional to the relative velocity of
the receiver with respect to the satellite along the line-of-sight from the receiver to the
satellite. 

7-4

Without  some type  of  information  to  indicate  this  change  in  frequency,  the  center
frequency of the receiver's replicated code signal will be different from the frequency of
the actual received signal, which may then cause loss of code track as well. 

A  receiver  may  be  able  to  maintain  code  track  in  this  case  even  while  losing  carrier
track if it is aided with velocity.  The primary function of aiding in this degraded mode of
operation is to maintain  code-loop  tracking.    The  velocity  data  replaces  the  carrier
tracking loop output as the source for code tracking loop aiding.  Possible sources of
velocity  include  INS, AHRS,  and  Doppler  navigation  systems.    Requirements  on  the
accuracy  of  the  velocity  will determine  the  allowable  amounts  of  senescence,
synchronization  error,  and  aiding  source  absolute  error  under  varying  dynamic
conditions.    For  example,  higher  dynamics  will  generally  mean  tighter  restrictions  on
data  senescence,  which  in  turn  can  mean  higher  aiding  rates.   Typical  accuracy
requirements on the aiding velocity in order to maintain code track when  the carrier is
lost are on the order of 2-3 m/second.

CHAPTER 8:  POSSIBLE INTEGRATIONS OF GPS

8.1  INTRODUCTION

There are two ways to achieve integration with GPS: aiding which results in a hybrid or
blended solution and aiding which results in a GPS solution.  Implementations can range
from a GPS receiver coupled with an external sensors such as an altimeter or a time aiding
source, to integration with a navigation system.  Examples of navigation systems include an
INS, an AHRS, or a Doppler Radar Navigation Systems (DRNS).

GPS  integrated  with  a  navigation  system  provides  the  flexibility  to  have  the  navigation
solution determined  by  the  GPS  receiver,  by  the  host  navigation  system,  or  by  a
combination of the two.  The GPS receiver can be aided by the host navigation system and
provide the blended solution, or the navigation system may process GPS data to form the
combined navigation solution. Another alternative is to have a central processor separate
from the receiver or host navigation system, receiving data from both the GPS and host
system and producing the blended  solution. This last case essentially treats both the GPS
receiver and host navigation system as sensors. The GPS receiver may reside on a card
that  is  embedded  into  the  host  navigation  system  box  so  that  the  receiver  physically
becomes part of the host navigation system.

The benefits of integrating GPS with other navigation systems are significant and diverse.
Basically,  each  system  may  have  important  shortcomings  when  used  in  a  stand-alone
mode, although together they can be integrated to mitigate most of these liabilities.  An INS,
AHRS,  or  DRNS,  for  example,  is  subject  to  an  ever  growing  drift  in  position  accuracy
caused by various instrument error sources that cannot be eliminated in  manufacturing,
calibration  or  alignment.  Other  INS  short comings  include  somewhat  lengthy  static
alignment  period  or,  alternatively,  continuous  operation  in  a  powered  alert  status. 
Furthermore,  a  high  quality  INS  can  be  a  complex  electro -mechanical  device  with
significant risk of component failure.  Additional shortcomings of Doppler systems include
the reliance on an external heading input to form a navigation solution. Mission or flight
critical  implementations  of  these  navigation  systems  require  substantial  redundancy  in
installation  to  detect,  isolate,  and  recover  from  such  failures  for  fail -safe  operational
performance.

A stand-alone GPS has its shortcomings as well.  GPS is somewhat vulnerable to loss of
signals due to RF interference, antenna shadowing, aircraft attitude maneuvers, or other
causes.  Receiver solution update rates may be fairly slow; i.e., in the 1 Hz region due to
the complex processing of the radio frequency signals into a position or velocity solution.  A
1  Hz  update  rate  may  be  sufficient  for  most  navigation  applications,  however,  some
avionics systems and weapons require much higher rates. 

GPS used in conjunction with an aiding source can solve some or all of these limitations,
depending on the aiding source used.  An aiding source such as an altimeter or a precise
time source can be substituted for a temporarily masked satellite.  An INS, for example, can

provide dynamic aiding data to the receiver that can be used to propa gate the GPS solution
during satellite outages and to aid in reacquisition of lost satellite signals.  B asically, the
marriage is between a short term, precise aiding source and the very long term, stable GPS
reference.

8.2  MISSION REQUIREMENTS

The  level  of  integration  will  largely  depend  on  the  particular  mission  requirements  for
navigation data accuracy and availability. Navigation system designers therefore need to
clearly examine the mission requirements before deciding on the level of GPS integration
necessary to adequately support military operations.  Sample considerations that drive an
integration design are listed below.

a.  Navigation  accuracy  -  What  position,  velocity  and/or  time  accuracy  are
required from the navigation solution supported by GPS?  GPS accuracy can
be improved through the use of DGPS if proper host and support equipment
is in-place (see Chapter 10).

b.  Availability of navigation solution  - What are the maximum HV dynamics for
which  the  GPS  set  must  navigate  continuously  with  the  highest  level  of
accuracy? Is the user required to navigate accurately in a high interference or
jamming  environment?    Sensor  aiding  data  can  greatly  improve  GPS
availability under adverse conditions.

c.  Reacquisition of GPS signal - How soon after any satellite signal inter ruption
must GPS regain full navigation accuracy?  How long can GPS interruption
be  accepted  without  measurable  degradation  of  system  per formance? 
Reacquisition can be improved by other sensors as a rough initial ization for
initial GPS signal acquisition as well as for rapid reacquisi tion should signals
temporarily be lost.

d.  Sensor  calibration  -  Is  calibration  of  other  navigation  sensors  by  GPS
required in order to maintain a high quality navigation during GPS outages?
Does GPS have to provide INS platform misalignment error estimates to a
quality that could support inflight INS alignment?  Is management of multiple
sensor  output  required  for  fault  tolerance?    GPS  and  other  navigation
sensors provide dissimilar redundancy for detecting hard and soft failures in
either system.

e.  Output rate of navigation solutions  - The GPS receiver navigation solution
output  rate  may  be  limited.  If  a  higher  output  rate  is  required,  the
integration may require the GPS receiver to aid the INS, or for the GPS
and  navigation  system  data  to  be  combined  in  an  external  navigation
processor instead of GPS being used as the primary navigation source.

f.  Modes  of  operation  -  Will  the  GPS  receiver  be  required  to  operate  as  a
primary or sole means of navigation and/or as a sensor to an INS, DRNS, or
mission computer? The intended use of GPS greatly affects the integra tion
strategy under signal loss or failure conditions.

8.3  INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURES

When  requirements  are  well  understood,  the  integration  design  has  to  address:  (1)  the
selection of GPS and other equipment, (2) the selection of data transfer and interfaces and
(3) the selection of a software concept.

There are essentially five architectures for integrating GPS in a system navigation solution.
The resulting system architecture for GPS integration will be one of these basic structures
as  discussed  in  the  following.  There  is  a  clear  distinction  in  the  potential  performance
available from the stand-alone receiver (see 8.3.1) and the aided/integrated configuration
(see  8.3.2  to  8.3.4).  However,  the  differences  between  the  performance  realized  in  the
aided/integrated  configurations  may  be  small  unless  the  mission  computer  makes
aggressive use of GPS inputs.

8.3.1  GPS Stand-Alone/Baro/Clock Aided

The GPS stand-alone configuration (see Figure 8-1) shows a GPS receiver with inputs  from
an antenna set and options for barometric altimeter and clock aiding. The receiver outputs
can drive any CDU or (analog) instrument that may be required.

This configuration would be used primarily for operation in low -dynamics.  The user must
be willing to accept reacquisition times of up to two minutes or more if the receiver loses
lock because of jamming or dynamics.

A barometric altimeter or an external clock are aiding options to coast the receiver
through short periods when visible satellites are less than four.  Especially for a
low-dynamic environment, a barometric altimeter, can be very cost effective. The GPS
receiver clock or a typical external clock can have drift rates that vary widely, from 10 -10
s/s to 10-7 s/s. Thus, position error could grow to 100 m (95%) in a few seconds.

An atomic clock with a stability  of 10-13 s/s will  keep  the  GPS receiver within a 100  m
(95%) position error for several minutes.

8.3.2  GPS/INS Integrations

The GPS INS-aided configuration (see Figure 8-2) is useful for medium to high dynamics
applications.    GPS  receives  INS  sensor  data  from  either  a  serial  (e.g.,  ARINC  429)  or
multiplex (e.g., MIL-STD-1553) data port. Output is provided through the ARINC 461 and
429  databus  port  to  the  CDU  and  instruments.      The  GPS  receiver  may  also  provide
position and velocity data to the INS.  For older INS's in particular, there may not be an
existing  interface  that  will  take  data  from  a  GPS  receiver.    This  situation  is  often
encountered when retrofitting GPS to vehicles that have been in service for a number of
years.  For integrating these systems with GPS, either the INS firmware must be modified to
accommodate GPS data, or the GPS receiver must accept the INS data, or the GPS/INS
integration must occur in a separate processor that accepts data from both the INS and
GPS.    In  the  last  two  cases,  the  INS  continues  to  run  free  inertial,  open  loop  with  no
feedback from the navigation processor if one is used.

If the INS solution can be updated by GPS, and is taken as the system navigation solution,
it will have an accuracy similar to GPS whenever GPS is available. If the GPS data is used
to  estimate  the  major  error  sources  that  affect  INS  position,  then  if  GPS  becomes
unavailable, the INS accuracy will degrade at a reduced rate when compared to the free
inertial INS position error growth rate. Baro metric altimeter and clock aiding may also be
available but is not necessary in the INS-aided mode.

As discussed in paragraph 9.4.2.1, these are different levels of GPS/INS integration. 
The simplest is referred to as "loosely coupled", where the GPS receiver processes
pseudorange and deltarange to produce geodetic position and velocity, which is then
used by the INS.  In this case, the INS is unaffected by the satellite geometry implicit in
the GPS solution.  However, if the receiver tracks less than four satellites, it may not be
able to produce a geodetic solution, causing the INS to lose aiding by the GPS.  A
more complex GPS/INS integration is called "tightly coupled" where the INS uses
pseudorange and/or deltarange

measurements to correct its navigation solution.  This implementation is more robust in
that it can continue to correct INS errors to some degree even when there are less than
four satellites being tracked.  A major consideration to using tightly coupled integrations
with current systems is that the pseudoranges and deltaranges corrected for SA are
classified.

8.3.3  GPS and Mission Computer/Databus Emulator

The  GPS  configuration  with  mission  computer/databus  emulator  (see  Figure  8-3)  is  a
means to provide the equivalent of 1553 bus operation in a vehicle that does not have a
1553-bus. It uses the mission computer (or sometimes a smart CDU) to emulate the ARINC
575  or  429  interface  to  GPS,  as  well  as  to  control  the  interfaces  to  other  navigation
sensors. The main penalty in comparison to a 1553 architecture is the limited data transfer
rate of the ARINC interfaces and the increased complexity of mission computer functions
required to support data formatting and transfer among the different sensors.

Examples of other systems to be integrated with GPS in this configuration are a doppler
radar (velocity) combined with an AHRS. An AHRS is similar to an INS except that only HV
attitude, attitude rates, heading and acceleration are available (no position). The quality of
its  output  information  is  lower  than  that  of  a  conventional  INS.  However,  an  integrated
GPS/AHRS may become a direct replacement for a high quality INS. The estimated cost of
an  integrated  GPS/AHRS  is  less  than  one -half  that  of  a  stand-alone  INS.  Additionally,
yearly maintenance costs are expected to be one -third that of an INS.

8.3.4  GPS in a 1553 Databus Configuration

A GPS receiver includes a highly evolved set of interfaces to external systems.  One such
interface is the high-speed databus MIL-STD-1553 (see Figur e 8-4).  The 1553 databus
may be used by high-dynamic, high-performance HVs to quickly transfer data between an
external system and the GPS receiver.

Although a GPS receiver usually can only receive and transmit a limited number of well
defined 1553  bus  data  blocks,  the  number  of  options  is  still  large.  Nevertheless,  an
integration cannot change the data blocks input to or output from a given GPS on the 1553

bus to meet its particular need. The only option is to program the 1553 bus controller to
convert message formats as required for GPS and other remote terminals to communicate
successfully.

8.3.5  Embedded GPS

The  previous  sections  essentially  address  integrations  of  physically  separate  GPS
receivers  and  other  sensors.    GPS  may  also  be  integrated  into  other  systems  by
embedding the receiver into the host system (eg., within an INS, DRNS, mission computer,
CDU, etc).  For these cases, the embedded system has the benefits of tight coupling as
described in paragraph 8.3.2. 

8.4  GPS AND TRANSIT/OMEGA/LORAN-C

Some hybrid systems have been developed that use the best data available from each of
GPS, Transit and Omega.  Navigation system measure ments from all three systems can be
integrated to generate an optimum system solution.  If four GPS satellites are available and
PDOP is within limits, the Transit and Omega measurement data are not required. Some
manufacturers  have  produced  hybrid  GPS  equipment  and  offered  retrofit  GPS  kits  for
installation in existing Transit/Omega receivers. This hybrid option has become significantly
less  attractive  since  the  GPS  constellation  has  reached  full  capability  and  Omega  has
begun phase-out.

Another hybrid variation is to combine a GPS receiver with a Loran-C receiver.  When
a GPS solution is available, the position information can be used to calibrate the Loran-
C  receiver for  daily  and  local  effects.    When  a  GPS  solution  is  not  available,  the
calibrated Loran-C receiver can be used as a stand-alone system. When GPS satellites
become  visible  again,  the  Loran-C  can  be  used  to  initialize  the  GPS  receiver  and
therefore reduce acquisition time.  A combination of Loran-C and GPS data can also be
used to produce a position solution or provide an automated cross-check for integrity
purposes.

CHAPTER 9:  GPS AND KALMAN FILTERING

9.1  INTRODUCTION

A  GPS  receiver  measures  pseudoranges  and  pseudorange  rates  to  the  satellites.
Knowing  the  position  of  the  satellites  from  the  decoded  navigation  messages,  the
user position and GPS system time can be calculated from four or more satellites.

A  GPS  receiver,  however,  can  never  measure  exact  range  to  each  satellite.    The
measurement process 
the
calculation.  This noise  includes  errors  in  the  ionospheric  corrections  and  system
dynamics  not  considered  during  the  measurement  process  (e.g.,  user  clock  drift).    A
Kalman  filter  characterizes  the  noise  sources  in  order  to  minimize  their  effect  on  the
desired receiver outputs.

is  corrupted  by  noise  which 

introduces  errors 

into 

When the GPS receiver is aided or integrated with other navigation sensors (e.g.,
INS,  clock,  altimeter  or  AHRS),  then  the  Kalman  filter  can  be  extended  to  include
the  measurements  added  by  these  sensors.    In  fact,  a  typical  implementation  for
integrated  systems  would  be  to  have  a  central  Kalman  filter  incorporating
measurements from all available sources.

9.2  KALMAN FILTER PRINCIPLE

The  Kalman  filter  is  a  linear,  recursive  estimator  that  produces  the  minimum
variance  estimate  in  a  least  squares  sense  under  the  assumption  of  white,
Gaussian noise processes. Because the filter is a linear estimator by definition, for
navigation systems it generally estimates errors in the total navigation state.  The
Kalman  filter  also  produces  a  measure  of  the  accuracy  of  its  error  state  vector
estimate.    This  level  of  accuracy  is  the  matrix  of  second  central  moments  of  the
errors in the estimate and is defined as the covariance matrix.

There are two basic processes that are modeled by a Kalman filter.  The first process is a
model describing how the error state vector changes in time.  This model is the system
dynamics model. The second model defines the relationship between the error state vector
and any measurements processed by the filter and is the measurement model.

Intuitively, the Kalman filter sorts out information and weights the relative contributions
of  the measurements  and  of  the  dynamic  behavior  of  the  state  vector.    The
measurements and state vector are weighted by their respective covariance matrices.
If  the  measurements  are  inaccurate  (large  variances)  when  compared  to  the  state
vector estimate, then the filter will deweight the measurements.  On the other hand, if
the  measurements  are  very  accurate  (small  variances)  when  compared  to  the  state
estimate,  then  the  filter  will  tend  to  weight  the  measurements  heavily  with  the
consequence  that  its  previously  computed  state  estimate  will  contribute  little  to  the
latest state estimate.

9-1

9.2.1  Kalman Filter Model

9.2.1.1  The System Dynamics Process

The system dynamics process is the model of how the error state vector transitions over
time.    The  total  navigation  state  is  defined  here  to  mean  position,  velocity,  and  perhaps
attitude.  The rate of change of the total navigation state will then be a nonlinear function of
the state, and is assumed to be driven by white noise.  Let  y(t) denote the total navigation
state and  y (t) its estimate.  The error in the estimated total navigation state is defined to be
  y (t) - y(t).  The nonlinear differential equation representing the time rate of change of
x(t) 
the  estimated  navigation  state  is  expanded  in  a  Taylor's  series  and  differenced  with  the
equation for the true state.  By ignoring higher order terms, a linear differential equation for
the time rate of change of the navigation error state is obtained.

It is natural to consider the behavior of the error state vector at discrete instants of time
since a computer is used to implement the Kalman filter.  Let  xk = x(tk) denote the error state
vector at time tk.  Then the discrete form of the continuous error state differential equation is

x    =   
k

  x

k-1

  +  G   w

k-1

K-1

The  matrix  Fk-1  is  the  state  transition  matrix  and  describes  how  the  error  state  vector
changes with time.  The sequence {wk} is a white, zero mean Gaussian noise sequence
called the process noise or plant noise.  The expected value of the outer product of the
vector wk with itself is a matrix of the second central moments of the components of the
noise vector.  This covariance matrix has the variances of the components of  wk  on  the
diagonal and the covariances of the components on the off diagonal, and is defined to be
E[wk wk

T] = Qk where E[*] is the expectation operator.

9.2.1.2  The Measurement Process

The measurement model defines how the error state vector is related to measurements
provided by sensor(s).  Some examples of sensors are doppler velocimeter providing
line-of-sight  velocity,  radar  altimeter  used  to  form  terrain  based  measurements  of
position,  such  as  for  TERCOM,  or  GPS  considered  as  a  sensor  giving  position  and
velocity  or  raw  pseudorange  and  deltarange  measurements.    Similar  to  the  total
navigation state differential equation, the measurement is often a nonlinear function of
the total navigation state.  By expanding the measurement equation for the estimated
navigation state in terms of its error state and neglecting higher order terms, a linear
measurement  equation  is  obtained  for  the  error  state  vector.    The  measurement
equation is written in discrete form as

where  zk  is  the  measurement  at  time  t k,  Hk  is  the  measurement  matrix,  (or
sometimes called the measurement observation, or measurement sensitivity matrix),
and {vk} is a white, zero mean Gaussian sequence with covariance matrix E[ vk vk
T] =
Rk.

9.2.2  Kalman Filter Algorithm

The  Kalman  filter  algorithm  recursively  estimates  the  error  state  vector.    It  also
calculates the uncertainty in its estimate as given by its covariance matrix.  Define
x k to be the estimate of the error state vector at time t k.  The estimation error is the
 x- x .  The covariance matrix of the estimation error at
error in this estimate, or  dx 
time tk gives a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated error state vector and is
defined as

P    =   E[ x ( x ) ]   =   E[( x   -   x ) ( x   -   x ) ]

The  system  dynamics  model  defines  the  behavior  of  the  error  state  vector  as  a
function of time.  The measurement model defines the correspondence between the
measurement and the error state.  The measurements are assumed to be available
at  discrete  times.    The  Kalman  filter  uses  the  dynamics  model  to  propagate  its
estimated  state  vector  between  measurements. 
the
measurement  into  the  error  state  estimate.    A  Kalman  filter  repetitively  performs
propagations and updates of its estimated error state and its associated covariance
matrix.  Figure 9-1 is a simplified diagram of the Kalman filter as it processes new
measurements and propagates in time.

The estimated error state vector and its covariance matrix are propagated from one

Typically the impact of the propagation on the covariance matrix is to increase the
variances of the non-bias estimated error states, although occasionally some of the
variances may decrease, for example when due to the Schuler effect.  The Schuler
effect  is  a  sinusoidal  oscillation  of  inertial  navigation  errors  with  an  84  minute
period.

9.2.2.2  Update

The Kalman filter incorporates measurements when they are available.  Since the
state carried in the Kalman filter is an error state, the measurement  zk is a function
of  the  error  state  vector,  and  is  usually  referred  to  as  the  apriori  measurement
residual.  The estimated error state vector is updated as

Although  much  simpler  than  the  Joseph  form,  caution  must  be  exercised  if  this
equation  is  used  since  it  is  susceptible  to  numerical  problems.    Since  P  is  a
covariance  matrix,  theoretically  it  is  symmetric  and  nonnegative  definite  (all
eigenvalues 3 0).  One approach to insure that P is always nonnegative definite is
to factor the initial P as a product of upper (or lower) unit triangular matrices and a
diagonal matrix as

P   =   U D UT

Here U is unit triangular and D is diagonal.  If the initial P is nonnegative definite,
then  all  elements  of  D  will  be  3  0.    Algorithms  exist  to  propagate  and  update  the
factors  U  and  D  instead  of  P  so  that  P  need  never  explicitly  be  formed.    These
algorithms operate on U and D in a manner that guarantees that the elements of D
are always 3 0, implying that P is always nonnegative definite.  Other algorithms can
also be used to ensure the positive definiteness of P.  The matrix P can be factored
into  a  product  of  lower  triangular  and  diagonal  matrices,  exactly  equivalent  to  the
UD  factorization,  or  P  may  be  factored  into  its  square  root  as  P  = W  W T  (square
root formulation).

Although  the  equation  for  the  Kalman  gain  seems  complex,  a  simple  example  will
help develop an intuitive feel for this gain calculation.  Note first that the updated
state estimate can be rewritten as

x (+)   =   (I  -   K   H )  x (-)  +  K   z
k

k

k

k

k

k

Assume  that  the  state  and  measurement  are  scalars  and  that  the  measurement
matrix H is 1. Then the Kalman gain is

K   =   P  /  (P + R)

For large uncertainty in the state model (P  R), as P  , then K  1.  As K  1, then
x k(+)  zk.  In other words, given the large uncertainty in the state, the new
measurement is assumed to be a much better estimate of the state than is the
propagated estimate.  On the contrary, for large uncertainty in the measurement
compared with the estimated state, R  P, then as R  , K  0.  As K  0, then  x k(+)
  x k(-).  Thus the new information is essentially ignored since the apriori estimate is
deemed much better than the

9-5

measurement.  This is an inherent danger in Kalman filters; once K becomes
sufficiently close to zero, the filter will respond very slowly or not at all to new
information.  Most Kalman filters incorporate an artificial lower limit on K to prevent
this from happening.
9.2.2.3  Initial Conditions

The  Kalman  filter  state  estimate  and  covariance  matrix  need  to  be  established  at
the initial time.  Then the propagations and updates proceed as noted.  The initial
state estimate  x 0 is set to the expected value of the state at t 0.  Without any prior
knowledge, the initial error state estimate is often set to the zero vector.  The initial
covariance matrix P 0  reflects  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  way  in  which  the
total navigation state is initialized.

9.3  KALMAN FILTERING FOR UNAIDED GPS

9.3.1  The GPS Navigation Process

GPS  signals  are  timed  at  their  arrival  at  the  receiver  by  the  code  loop  correlation
process.    The  total  slew  of  the  bit  edge  that  achieves  maximum  correlation  with  the
incoming code is the time offset from the local reference time.  The time of broadcast is
contained in the navigation message, which is decoded in the receiver after correlation.
The difference between the time of broadcast and the time of arrival is the transit time
from the satellite to the receiver.  This includes the receiver and satellite clock offsets
from the GPS time.

Multiplication  of  the  calculated  time  of  transit  by  the  speed  of  transmission  (light)
results  in  a  measurement  of  pseudorange.  Corrections  may  be  made  to  this
pseudorange for the assumed, modeled, or measured tropospheric and/or ionospheric
delays.    In  stand-alone  operation  of  single  frequency  receivers,  the  modeled
corrections  are  generally  applied.    Dual  frequency  receivers  will  measure  the
ionospheric delay directly and apply a smoothed value.

The  measurement  process  is  corrupted  by  noise  which  introduces  errors  into  the
calculations.    Examples  of  errors  are  receiver  clock  drift,  errors  in  the  ionospheric
corrections and system dynamics not considered during the measurement process.

With four pseudorange measurements to four different satellites, the absolute position
and  user  clock  offset  could  be  found.    Algorithms  exist  to  analytically  find  the  user
position and clock offset from a set of four pseudorange measurements.  A solution is
usually  implemented  with  an  assumed  rough  location  and  iterative  updates  to  that
location, essentially an application of Newton's root finding method as implemented in a
Kalman filter.

The velocity of the GPS receiver is computed by processing the relative velocity along
the line-of-sight between the satellite and the receiver.  This relative velocity is usually
obtained  by  measuring  the  Doppler  offset  of  the  incoming  carrier  signal.    The
measurement  is  called  deltarange  which  includes  the  receiver  clock  frequency  drift.
Similar  to  the  position  computation,  the  receiver  clock  error  (drift  in  the  case  of
deltarange  measurements)  is  an  unknown  parameter  and  should  be  resolved  along
with the absolute velocity.

9-6

Deltarange  measurements  can  be  computed  by  summing  up  the  carrier  voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) commands in the carrier tracking loop which tracks the
phase of the received signal.  The changes in measured phases are fed back to the
VCO to zero out these changes.

As  with  the  pseudorange  measurements,  four  deltarange  measurements  to  four
different  satellites  allow  velocity  and  user  clock  drift  to  be  computed  analytically,
although an iterative procedure is typically employed.

9.3.2  The GPS Navigation Equation

Figure  9-2  shows  the  basic  relation  between  the  line -of-sight  pseudorange
measurement  PRi  (i=1,..,4  satellites),  the  satellites  positions  (S xi,  Syi,  Szi),  and  the
(antenna) user position coordinates (U x, Uy, Uz).  The equation for the pseudorange
is as follows:

PR    =    [(S   -  U )  +  (S   -  U )  + (S   -  U ) ]

Note  that  since  the  deltarange  measurements  are  found  by  a  scaled  sum  of  VCO
commands  from  the  carrier  tracking  loops,  the  average  receiver  and  satellite
velocities  over  the  deltarange  dwell  time  should  be  used  in  the  above  equations
instead of instantaneous velocities.  The average velocity can be approximated by
the velocity at the midpoint of the deltarange interval.

With  four  pseudorange  measurements,  there  are  four  simultaneous  quadratic
equations with four unknowns, the three coordinates of user position and the user's
receiver  clock  offset.    Except  in  unusual  geometric  conditions,  there  exists  a
solution.    In  practice,  there  are  many  computations  to  be  made  before  arriving  at
this  equation.    For  example,  the  satellite  positions  are  broadcast  as  orbital
parameters  (ephemerides)  and  are  a  function  of  current  time.    In  all,  24  variables
must be computed or solved from the available information.

9.3.3  The GPS Kalman Filter Model

To cast the Kalman filter equations in GPS form for the unaided receiver, the state
vector must be defined and the system dynamics and measurement m atrices must
be  formulated.    As a minimum,  typically  an  eight  state  error  vector  is  chosen:
position  error  (dx,  dy,  dz),  receiver  clock  phase  error  (b u),  velocity  error  (dv x,  dvy,
dvz) and receiver clock frequency error (f u):

The  state  transition  matrix  for  the  dynamic  model  can  take  various  forms.    Often,
unaided receivers will model the vehicle motion as a constant velocity with process
noise to account for accelerations.  In that case the propagation equations are as
follows:

9.3.4  GPS Augmented Kalman Filter

A modification of this formulation is to include three acceleration states in addition
to  the  position  and  velocity  states.    Although  there  is  no  direct  measurement  of
acceleration in the unaided GPS receiver, these augmented states aid the filter in
sorting out non-zero mean errors. Specifically, if these states are included, and the
vehicle  undergoes  constant  acceleration,  the  apparent  discrepancy  in  the  velocity
data  will  build  up  as  a  bias  in  the  acceleration  states,  and  the  resultant  filter
accuracy will improve.  In essence, these states represent an unknown bias error in
the states related to the velocity terms by their first difference, so the filter assumes
that  any  such  errors  belong  in  these  states.    Of  course,  if  the  acceleration  is  not
constant,  the  acceleration  states  will  not  perfectly  track  the  error,  and  in  fact  the
filter will respond more sluggishly to the velocity changes.  But for the case of an
aircraft with constant acceleration turns, the augmented state filter will outperform
the eight-state filter.

9.3.5  GPS Kalman Filter Tuning

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  covariance  matrix  is  actually  an  estimate  of  the
statistics of the estimation error vector.  Mismodeling of the system dynamics or of
the  process  or  measurement  noises  can  cause 
true  estimation  error
uncertainties  to  be  quite  different  from  the  covariance  matrix  computed  by  the
Kalman filter.  Modeling only a subset of the total set of errors (suboptimal Kalman
filter)  will  also  cause  an  inaccurate  covariance  matrix.    When  this  occurs,  the
accuracy  of  the  navigation  system  may  be  substantially  degraded.    The  process
whereby  the  covariance  matrix  of  the  mechanized  filter  is  made  to  closely
approximate the true covariance matrix is referred to as Kalman filter tuning.

the 

One way in which GPS Kalman filters are often tuned is through the use of adaptive
tuning.  Specifically, this refers to dynamically setting the process noise Q as a function
of vehicle motion. This approach is used to account for mismodeling in the state
dynamics model.  In this case, the errors are not Gaussian noise, but may be biases in
turns as already shown.  Therefore, the correct Q depends on the vehicle profile.  For
straight and level flight, a small  Q is appropriate.  For turns or higher dynamics, Q must
be larger.  For filter stability reasons,  Q must be set to the highest level of uncertainty
expected. This means that in

9-10

straight and level flight, for example, the Q will be overly pessimistic and will force
processing too much noise from the measurements due to larger Kalman gains than
needed.

The answer is to adapt Q, by setting it as small as possible, then using some other
observation  to  boost  Q  when  needed.    Some  schemes  tried  in  GPS  receivers
include  making  Q  a  function  of  the  ratio  of  the  observed  measurement  residuals
with the assumed measurement noise.  The only danger here is that if Q is allowed
to  adapt  too  quickly,  the  filter  can  get  into  a  positive  feedback  loop  and  cause
instability.  This happens when observed noise opens Q which creates more noise,
etc.  The resolution of this problem is to make Q adaptation very slow so that only
longer  trend  conditions  cause  a  change  in  Q.    In  practice,  the  adaptation  may  be
implemented  directly  on  the  covariance  rather  than  the  Q  term,  but  the  effect  is
similar.

9.4  KALMAN FILTERING FOR AIDED/INTEGRATED GPS

9.4.1  The Integrated Navigation Solution

GPS  provides  accurate  position,  velocity  and  time  and  is  designed  to  perform  in
all-weather, at any time of the day, and under specified conditions of jamming and
HV dynamics.  Despite its superb performance, many integrators choose to go one
step further and combine GPS with other navigation sensors and systems available
in  the  HV  into  an  integrated  navigation  solution.    Similar  to  the  basic  GPS
navigation equations, this integrated solution is using a Kalman filter to combine the
individual navigation solutions.

Since  GPS  is  the  most  accurate  positioning  system  with  worldwide  coverage
currently  available,  the  integrated  system  navigation  solution  will  essentially  be
based  on  the  GPS  solution  when  GPS  is  available.    The  system  design  will  be
driven by the unifying concern for continued high quality navigation when the GPS
solution is unavailable because of jamming, dynamics or satellite failures.

Technical  considerations  for  integrations  of  GPS  with  other  sensors  include  the
choice  of  system  architecture, 
the
characterization  and  modeling  of  additional  measurements  added  by  the  other
sensors.  The most important integration is the one in which GPS is combined with
an INS.  Besides the combination of GPS and INS, the integration can also benefit
from sensors in the HV such as a precise clock, barometric altimeter or an AHRS in
the absence of an INS.

the  hosting  of 

the  Kalman 

filter,  and 

9.4.2  Kalman Filtering and GPS/INS
9.4.2.1  System Architecture

There  are  basically  four  different  architectures  possible  in  the  combined  GPS/INS
implementation,  depending  on  the  choice  of  hosting  the  Kalman  filter  and  the
choice  of  open or closed-loop  technique.    Whether  the  integrated  filter  uses
position and velocity derived from the GPS Kalman filter or uses pseudoranges and
deltaranges is usually referred  as loosely coupled or tightly coupled respectively.

9-11

The simplest way to combine GPS and INS is a reset-only mechanization in which
GPS is used to periodically reset the INS solution (see Figure 9-3).  In this loosely
coupled,  open-loop  strategy  the  INS  is  not  recalibrated  by  GPS  data,  so  the
underlying error sources in the INS still drive its navigation errors as soon as GPS
resets are interrupted.  However, for short GPS interruptions or for high quality INS,
the error growth may be small enough to meet mission requirements.

The main advantage of GPS aiding the INS in a closed -loop mechanization is that
the  inertial  system  is  continuously  calibrated  by  the  Kalman  filter,  using  the  GPS
observables  (see  Figure  9-4).  When  GPS  is  lost  due  to  jamming,  dynamics  or
satellite  shadowing,  the  inertial  system  can  continue  to  derive  its  navigation
solution,  but  now  with  a  greater  degree  of  precision  by  virtue  of  its  recent
calibration.    However,  this  loosely  coupled,  closed  loop  technique  has  serious
potential  stability  problems  in  cases  where  the  INS  feeds  back  navigation  data  to
the GPS receiver.

GPS aiding the INS (loosely coupled) in both open and closed -loop modes results
in the simplest implementation: any GPS receiver and any INS with the necessary
data interfaces can be used and it requires a smaller Kalman mechanization of the

9-12

integrated  INS  filter  since  the  INS  treats  the  GPS  receiver  merely  as  another
sensor.  Disadvantages are the use of two separate Kalman filters with the potential
instability  of  cascaded  filters,  and  that  the  GPS  Kalman  filter  provides  correlated
position and velocity measurements that may not be modeled adequately in the INS
filter.

The  next  level  of  integration  is  the  tightly  coupled,  open -loop  integrated  GPS/INS
Kalman filter which requires implementation at pseudorange level (see Figure 9-5).
This  approach  has  more  complex  measurement  equations  but  requires  only  one
Kalman  filter  mechanization.    The  filter  can  be  closer  to  optimal  since  effects  of
satellite  geometry  and  INS  errors  are  included  and  INS  aiding  throughout  a  GPS
outage can be provided.  Only one naviga tion solution is computed and both carrier
and code tracking loop aiding can be done using the velocity and attitude data from
the INS.

and  the  other  benefits  of  the  tightly  coupled,  open-loop  filter,  the  main  advantage
here is that the INS is continuously calibrated and will maintain the most accurate
navigation solution in case of GPS outages.

9.4.2.2  The INS Navigation Process

The  INS  Kalman  filter  will  model  and  estimate  some  of  the  INS  errors.    An  INS
consists of, as a minimum, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a computer to
perform processing. The inertial sensors are accelerometers and gyroscopes which
measure, loosely speaking, inertial accelerations and rotations.

Most  IMU's  fall  into  one  of  two  classes.  The  first,  and  oldest  type,  is  a  gimballed
platform. In a gimballed IMU, the accelerometer triad is mounted on a platform that
is maintained stable in inertial space by the gyros. A locally level navigation frame
is usually mechanized so that the gyros are "torqued" for transport and earth rates
to  force  the  platform  to  remain  perpendicular  to  the  local  gravity  vector.  Thus  the
accelerometers  measure  accelerations  directly  in  the  local  level  plane.    Many
gimballed platforms also include a third accelerometer orthogonal to the two in the
platform  plane  that  measures  vertical  specific  force.  The  attitude  of  the  IMU  case
with respect to the platform is determined through electrical pickoffs of the gimbal
structure.

The second type of IMU is the strapdown system. In a strapdown IMU, the gyros are
rate  integrating  and  are  essentially  hard  mounted  to  the  host  vehicle.  The  gyros
measure incremental angular change. The computer must keep track of the angular
changes  so  that  the  attitude  of  the  host  vehicle  can  be  determined.  The  three
accelerometers  measure  linear  accelerations  as  in  the  case  of  a  gimballed  IMU,
although the accelerations are in the vehicle  body  frame.  The  transformation  from
the platform to navigation frames is used to convert the accelerations to navigation
coordinates where they are integrated to produce velocity and position.

9-14

To summarize, an INS consists of three major subsystems:

1. Attitude  subsystem  where  the  orientation  of  the  IMU  with  respect  to  the

navigation frame is maintained

2. Specific  force  sensing  subsystem,  usually  three  single-axis  accelerometers,

that measure accelerations

3. Computation  subsystem,  in  which  INS  navigation  equations  of  motion  are

solved.

Depending  upon  the  instrument  quality,  INS  position  error  rates  can  range  from  0.1
nm/hr  to  10.0  nm/hr.    Although  the  INS  errors  can  grow  unbounded,  their  temporal
behavior has a very well defined frequency behavior.  Horizontal errors will oscillate at
the  Schuler  frequency  (with  an  84-minute  period)  modulated  by  earth  rate  (24  hour
period) and the second order Foucault frequency (period depends on vehicle velocity,
direction, and latitude).

The  pure  inertial  vertical  channel  of  an  INS  is  unstable  with  a  time  constant  of  9.5
minutes.  For this reason many inertial navigation systems incorporate baro -altimeter
stabilization of its vertical channel.  Note that for GPS/INS integrated filters, the baro-
altimeter  error  can  be  estimated  through  GPS  position  measurements.    Since  direct
GPS  measurements  of  position  yield  reference  ellipsoid  altitude,  the  baro-altimeter
error estimated includes the offset of local mean sea level from the ellipsoid.

An  important  error  source  in  an  INS  is  an  error  in  knowledge  of  the  orientation  or
alignment of  the  INS  sensor  package  with  respect  to  its  navigation  frame.    These
misalignment  errors  are  usually  expressed  as  three  small  rotation  angles  and  are
referred to as platform tilts.  In a strapdown INS, the three angles are related to pitch,
roll  and  heading  error,  while  in  a  gimballed  system  the  angles  are  identified  with
rotations of the platform about the level and vertical axes.

The three accelerometers in an INS are usually mounted in a mutually orthogonal triad,
each one  measuring  a  component  of  specific  force  along  its  sensitive  axis.    Typical
accelerometer  errors  include  bias,  scale  factor,  and  misalignments  among  others.    A
bias  error  means  that  the  instrument  reading  is  always  off  by  a  fixed  amount  of
acceleration.  A scale factor error refers to an error in the accelerometer output by a
constant  multiplicative 
the
accelerometer  to  sense  components  of  accelerations  that  occur  along  an  axis
supposedly orthogonal to its input axis.

  An  accelerometer  misalignment  will  cause 

factor. 

An  INS  usually  has  gyros  mounted  with  their  sensitive  axes  in  a  mutually  orthogonal
triad.  The gyros may be single or dual axis (2 degree-of-freedom) in nature.  Two 2
degree-of-freedom  gyros  provide  outputs  along  3  orthogonal  axes  and  along  1
redundant  axis.    The  gyro  axes  have  a  known,  fixed  orientation  with  respect  to  the
accelerometers.  A gyro drift rate or bias is a constant angular rate of change of the
platform tilts.  Gyros errors also include scale factor errors, misalignments, and in the
case  of  spinning  mass  gyros,  g-sensitive  drift  rates.    The  gyro  bias  errors  are  the
primary cause of increasing horizontal position errors  and consequently are the errors
most necessary to minimize for longer missions.

9-15

9.4.2.3  The INS Kalman Filter States

For an INS Kalman filter implementation, 15 states are often used to describe the
INS navigation process and its error sources:







3 INS position errors
3 INS velocity errors
3 platform orientation errors
3 accelerometer biases
3 gyro drift rates

For  some  applications,  particularly  if  the  mission  scenario  calls  for  only  short
periods  of  time  without  GPS  data,  it  may  be  possible  to  model  an  INS  with  fewer
states.

There  are  many  other  sources  of  error  in  an  INS  in  addition  to  the  states  given
above  as  noted  previously:  gyro  and  accelerometer  scale  factor  errors,  gyro  and
accelerometer  input  axis  misalignment  angles,  gyro  g -sensitivity,  etc.    Usually  the
effects  of  these  errors  are  accounted  for  in  the  computation  of  the  process  noise
covariance matrix Q.  Failure to account for the effects of these errors will almost
always  result  in  optimistic  filter  performance;  that  is,  the  true  estimation  error
standard  deviations  will  be  larger  than  the  standard  deviations  in  the  covariance
matrix computed by the Kalman filter.  In addition, the INS manufacturer attempts to
minimize their effects by providing calibration coefficients and test data on the INS
themselves.

9.4.3  Kalman Filtering and GPS/Precise Clock

In case an external clock is used for GPS time reference, its phase and frequency
error can be included as states in the Kalman filter. Corrections are calculated and
either  maintained  in  the  mission  computer  (open-loop)  or  directly  applied  to  the
clock continuously (closed-loop).

When the receiver starts to navigate with only three satellites, the calibrated clock
can then be used to maintain accurate GPS system time. This also applies to a two
satellite  situation  if  receiver  altitude  is  known.    What  accuracy  can  be  maintained
and for how long depends on the detail of the error models and the disturbance to
the clock during the outage period. Examples of such disturbances are temperature
changes, pressure changes, crystal aging, accelerations and vibrations.

9.4.4  Kalman Filtering and GPS/Barometric Altimeter

A barometric altimeter is typically included in a stand -alone INS for damping of its
otherwise  unstable  vertical  loop.    In  a  GPS/INS  integration,  inclusion  of  a
barometric  altimeter  is  recommended  both  for  aiding  poor  vertical  geometry
situations  under  nominal  conditions  and  for  three-satellite  situations.    If  GPS
outages  occur  for  extended  periods  of  time,  then    some  other  type    of  reference
altitude is required to stabilize the vertical channel.
The barometric altimeter can be processed as a measurement to the Kalman filter
since the vertical channel is effectively stabilized through the optimal Kalman filter

9-16

gains.    In  this  case,  the  barometric  altimeter  error  is  modeled  in  the  Kalman  filter
state vector.  The barometric altimeter measurement will only be processed by the
Kalman  filter  when  GPS  satellite  coverage  is  incomplete.    If  not  processed  as  a
measurement  to  the  Kalman  filter,  the  barometric  altitude  can  be  differenced  with
inertial  altitude  to  create  an  error  signal  that  is  filtered  and  fed  back  to  inertial
altitude, giving a blended baro/inertial altitude.

9.4.5  Kalman Filtering and GPS/AHRS

An AHRS is a strapdown system which uses lower quality gyros and accelerometers
than  a  strapdown  INS.    Used  as  a  stand -alone  system,  an  AHRS  is  similar  to  an
INS,  except  that  no  position  is  available,  only  attitude  (pitch,  roll  and  heading),
attitude rates and acceleration.

GPS  can  provide 
three-dimensional  bounded  position  and  velocity  aiding
information to the AHRS to improve its outputs.  An AHRS, in its turn, can be used
for  short-term  fill-in  of  velocity  information  if  the  receiver  outputs  are  lost.
Potentially,  AHRS  velocity  could  also  aid  the  GPS  receiver  tracking  loops  during
short periods of jamming or high dynamics. The separate Kalman filter, in case of
an aided GPS/AHRS, does not include the vertical channel. A typical Kalman filter
model has 14 error states: horizontal position (2), hori zontal velocity (2), rotations
(2),  gyro  drift  rates  (3),  gyro  scale  factor  (1),  wander -azimuth  angle  (1)  and
accelerometer bias (3).  The combined Kalman filter for a tightly coupled, integrated
GPS/AHRS  adds  four  error  states:  vertical  position,  vertical  velocity,  clock  phase
error and clock frequency error.

CHAPTER 10:  DIFFERENTIAL GPS

10.1  INTRODUCTION

Differential  GPS  (DGPS)  was  developed  to  meet  the  needs  of  positioning  and
distance  measuring  applications  that  required  higher  accuracies  than  stand-alone
GPS  could  deliver.  A  typical  differential  GPS  architecture  (see  Figure  10-1)
consists of a reference receiver located at a surveyed, known location, and one or
more DGPS user receivers.  The user receivers are often called "mobile" receivers
because they are not confined to a fixed location like the reference receiver.  The
Reference  Receiver  antenna,  differential  correction  processing  system,  and  data
link equipment (if used) are collectively called the Reference Station.  Both sets of
receivers either collect and store the necessary data for later  processing,  or  send
them to the desired location in real time via the data link.

Figure 10-1.  Typical Differential System Architecture

This overview outlines some of the fundamental issues of DGPS.  These issues should
be considered by any user considering the need for a positioning system that can give
accuracies better than the absolute PPS or SPS performance.

10-1

10.2  DGPS CONCEPT

DGPS is based on the principle that receivers in the same vicinity will simultaneously
experience common errors on a particular satellite ranging signal.  In general, the user
(mobile)  receivers  use  measurements  from  the  reference  receiver  to  remove  the
common  errors.    In  order  to  accomplish  this,  the  user  (mobile)  receivers  must
simultaneously use a subset or the same set of satellites as the reference station.   The
DGPS  positioning  equations  are  formulated  so  that  the  common  errors  cancel.    The
common errors include signal path delays through the atmosphere, and satellite clock
and ephemeris errors.  For PPS users, the common satellite errors are residual system
errors  that  are  normally  present  in  the  PVT  solution.    For  SPS  users,  the  common
satellite  errors  also  include  the  intentionally  added  errors  from  SA.    Errors  that  are
unique to each receiver, such as receiver measurement noise and multipath, cannot be
removed  without  additional  recursive  processing  (by  the  reference  receiver,  user
receiver, or both) to provide an averaged, smoothed, or filtered solution.

Various DGPS techniques are employed depending on the accuracy desired, where the
data processing is to be performed, and whether real-time results are required.  If real-
time results are required then a data link is also required.  For applications without a
real-time  requirement,  the  data  can  be  collected  and  processed  later.    The  accuracy
requirements  usually  dictate  which  measurements  are  used  and  what  algorithms  are
employed.  Under normal conditions, DGPS accuracy is independent of whether SPS
or PPS is being used, although real-time PPS DGPS can have a lower data rate than
SPS DGPS because the rate of change of the nominal system errors is slower than the
rate of change of SA.  However, the user and the Reference Station must be using the
same service (either PPS or SPS).

The  clock  and  frequency  biases  for  a  particular  satellite  will  appear  the  same  to  all
users since these parameters are unaffected by signal propagation or distance from the
satellite.    The  pseudorange  and  deltarange  (Doppler)  measurements  will  be  different
for different users, because they will be at different locations and have different relative
velocities with respect to the satellite, but the satellite clock and frequency bias will be
common  error  components  of  those  measurements.    The  signal  propagation  delay  is
truly a common error for receivers in the same location, but as the distance between
receivers increases, this error gradually decorrelates and becomes independent.  The
satellite ephemeris has errors in all three dimensions.  Therefore, part of the error will
appear as a common range error and part will remain a residual ephemeris error. The
residual portion is normally small and its impact remains small for similar observation
angles to the satellite.   

The  accepted  standard  for  SPS  DGPS  was  developed  by  the  Radio  Technical
Commission  for Maritime  Services  (RTCM)  Special  Committee-104  (SC-104).    The
RTCM developed standards for the use of differential corrections, and defined the data
format  to  be  used  between the reference  station  and  the  user.    The  stan dards  are
primarily  intended  for  real  time operational use  and  cover  a  wide  range  of  DGPS
measurement types.  Most SPS DGPS  receivers are compatible with the RTCM SC-104

10.3  DGPS IMPLEMENTATION TYPES

There are two primary variations of the differential measurements and equations. 
One is based on ranging-code measurements and the other based on carrier-phase
measurements.  There  are  also  several  ways  to  implement  the  data  link  function. 
DGPS  systems  can  be  designed  to  serve  a  limited  area  from  a  single  reference
station, or can use a network of reference stations and special algorithms to extend
the validity of the DGPS technique over a wide area.  The result is that there is a
large  variety  of  possible  DGPS  system  implementations  using  combinations  of
these design features.

10.3.1  Ranging-Code Differential

The  ranging-code  differential  technique  uses  the  pseudorange  measurements  of
the reference station to calculate pseudorange or position corrections for the user
receivers.    The  reference  station  calculates  pseudorange  corrections  for  each
visible satellite by subtracting the "true" range, determined by the surveyed position
and  the  known  orbit  parameters,  from  the  measured  pseudorange.    The  user
receiver then selects the appropriate correction for each satellite that it is tracking,
and  subtracts  the  correction  from  the  pseudorange  that  it  has  measured.    The
mobile  receiver  must  only  use  those  satellites  for  which  corrections  have  been
received.

If  the  reference  station  provides  position  corrections  rather  than  pseudorange
corrections,  the  corrections  are  simply  determined  by  subtracting  the  measured
position from the surveyed position. The advantage of using position corrections is
obviously the simplicity of the calculations.  The disadvantage is that the reference
receiver and the user receiver must use the exact same set of satellites.  This can
be  accomplished  by  coordinating  the  choice  of  satellites  between  the  reference
receiver  and  the  user  receiver,  or  by  having  the  reference  station  compute  a
position correction for each possible combination of satellites.  For these reasons, it
is usually more flexible and efficient to provide pseudorange corrections rather than
position corrections.  The RTCM SC-104 and RTCA DO-217 formats are all based
on pseudorange rather than position corrections.

The  pseudorange  or  position  corrections  are  time  tagged  with  the  time  that  the
measurements were taken.  In real-time systems, the rate of change of the corrections
is also calculated.  This allows the user to propagate the corrections to the time that
they are actually applied to the user position solution.  This reduces the impact of data
latency  on  the  accuracy  of  the  system  but  does  not  eliminate  it  entirely.    SPS
corrections  become  fully  uncorrelated  with  the  user  measurements  after  about  2
minutes.    Corrections  used  after  two  minutes  may  produce  solutions  which  are  less
accurate than stand-alone SPS GPS.  PPS corrections can remain correlated with the
user measurements for 10 minutes or more under benign (slowly changing) ionospheric
conditions.

10-3

10.3.2  Carrier-Phase Differential

The  carrier-phase  measurement  technique  uses  the  difference  between  the  carrier
phases measured at the reference receiver and user receiver.  A double-differencing
technique is used to remove the satellite and receiver clock errors.  The first difference
is the difference  between  the  phase  measurements  at  the  user  receiver  and  the
reference receiver for a single satellite.  This eliminates the satellite clock error which is
common to both measurements.  This process is then repeated for a second satellite. 
A  second  difference  is  then  formed  by  subtracting  the  first  difference  for  the  first
satellite from the first difference for the second satellite.  This eliminates both receiver
clock  errors  which  are  common  to  the  first  difference  equations.    This  process  is
repeated  for  two  other  pairs  of  satellites  resulting  in  three  double-differenced
measurements that can be solved for the difference between the reference station and
user  receiver  locations.    This  is  inherently  a  relative  positioning  technique,  therefore
the  user  receiver  must  know  the  reference  station  location  to  determine  its  absolute
position.  Refer to Chapter 11 for a more detailed description of this process.

This same technique can be used to determine the attitude of a vehicle or platform.
 In  this  case  the  processing  can  be  contained  within  one  receiver  using  multiple
fixed antennas.  One antenna can be arbitrarily chosen as the "reference".  Since
the  antennas  are  separated  by  fixed  distances  and  since  their  relationship  to  the
center-of-mass of the platform is known, it is possible to convert the carrier phase
differences into angular differences between the antenna locations and the line-of-
sight to a satellite.  By using measurements from multiple satellites, or the position
of  the  platform  from  a  DGPS  position  fix,  these  angular  differences  can  be
transformed  to  represent  the  attitude  of  the  platform  with  respect  to  the  local
vertical axis.

The  "raw"  phase  measurements  are  essentially  a  count  of  the  number  of  carrier
cycles between the satellite and receiver positions.  The number of cycles times the
carrier  wavelength  is  a  range  measurement.    The  receivers  can  directly  measure
the  fractional  portion  of  the  phase  measurement  and  can  track  phase  shifts
including  whole  cycles,  but  they  must  calculate  the  initial  whole  number  of  cycles
between  the  receiver  and  the  satellite.  This  is  referred  to  as  the  integer  cycle
ambiguity.

For surveying applications, this integer ambiguity can be resolved by starting with
the mobile receiver antenna within a wavelength of the reference receiver antenna.
 Both receivers start with the same integer ambiguity, so the difference is zero and
drops  out  of  the  double-difference  equations.    Thereafter,  the  phase  shift  that  the
mobile  receiver  observes  (whole  cycles)  is  the  integer  phase  difference  between
the  two  receivers.    For  other  applications  where  it  is  not  practical  to  bring  the
reference  and  mobile  antennas  together,  the  reference  and  mobile  receivers  can
solve  for  the  ambiguities  independently  as  part  of  an  initialization  process.    One
way is to place the mobile receiver at a surveyed location.  In this case the initial
difference is not necessarily zero but it is an easily calculated value.

10-4

For  some  applications  (such  as  aircraft  precision  approach),  it  is  essential  to  be
able to solve for the integer ambiguity at an unknown location or while in motion (or
both).  In this case, solving for the integer ambiguity usually consists of eliminating
incorrect  solutions  until  the correct solution  is  found.    A  good  initial  estimate  of
position (such as from ranging-code differential) helps to keep the initial number of
candidate  solutions  small.    Redundant  measurements  over  time  and/or  from  extra
satellite signals are used to isolate the correct solution.  These "search" techniques
can  take  as  little  as  a  few  seconds  or  up  to  several  minutes  to  perform  and  can
require  significant  computer  processing  power.    This  version  of  the  carrier-phase
DGPS technique is typically called kinematic differential GPS.

If  carrier  track  or  phase  lock  on  a  satellite  is  interrupted  and  the  integer  count  is
lost,  then  the  initialization  process  must  be  repeated  for  that  satellite  (known  as
cycle clip).  Output data flow may also be interrupted if the receiver is not collecting
redundant measurements from extra satellites to maintain the position solution.  If a
precise position solution is maintained, reinitialization for the "lost" satellite can be
almost  immediate.    Developing  a  robust  and  rapid  method  of  initialization  and
reinitialization  is  the  primary  challenge  facing  designers  of  real-time  systems  that
have a safety critical application such as aircraft precision approach.

10.3.3  DGPS Data Link Implementations

DGPS can also be implemented in several different ways depending on the type of
data  link  used.    The  simplest  data  link  is  no  data  link  at  all.    For  non-real-time
applications, the measurements can be stored in the receiver or on suitable media
and processed at a later time.  In most cases to achieve surveying accuracies, the
data  must  be  post-processed  using  precise  ephemeris  data  that  is  only  available
after  the  survey  data  has  been  collected.  Similarly,  for  some  test  applications  the
cost and effort to maintain a real-time data link may be unnecessary.  Nevertheless,
low-precision  real-time  outputs  can  be  useful  to  confirm  that  a  survey  or  test  is
progressing properly even if the accuracy of the results will be enhanced later.

Differential  corrections  or  measurements  can  be  uplinked  in  real-time  from  the
reference station to the users.  This is the most common technique where a large
number of users must be served in real-time.  If the user receivers are passive as in
GPS itself, an unlimited number of users can be served.  For military purposes and
proprietary commercial services, the uplink can be encrypted to restrict the use of
the DGPS signals to a select group of users.

An  uplink  can  be  a  separate  transmitter/receiver  system  or  the  DGPS  signals  can
be  superimposed  on  a  GPS-like  D-band  ranging  signal.    The  uplink  acts  as  a
pseudo-satellite or "pseudolite" and delivers the ranging signal and DGPS data via
the  RF  section  of  the  user  receiver,  much  in  the  same  way  the  GPS  navigation
message  is  transmitted.    The  advantages  are  that  the  additional  ranging  signal(s)
can  increase  the  availability  of  the  position  solution,  or  decrease  carrier-phase
initialization  time,  and  a  separate  data  link  system  is  not  required.  However,  the
reference station and user receivers become more complex and the pseudolite can
become a GPS jammer if it overpowers the GPS satellite signals.

10-5

A downlink option is also possible from the users to the reference station or other
central collection point.  In this case the differential solutions are all calculated at a
central  location.  This  is often  the  case  for  test  range  applications  where  precise
vehicle tracking is desired but the information is not used aboard the vehicle.  The
downlinked data can be  position data plus the satellites tracked, or pseudorange and
deltarange  measurements,  or  it  can  be  the  raw  GPS  signals  translated  to  an
intermediate frequency.  The translator method can often be the least expensive with
respect to user equipment, and therefore is often used in munitions testing where the
user equipment may be expendable.

10.3.4  Local Area and Wide Area Systems

The  accuracy  of  a  DGPS  solution  developed  using  a  single  reference  station  will
degrade  with  distance  from  the  reference  station  site.    This  is  due  to  the  increasing
difference  between  the  reference  and  user  receiver  ephemeris,  ionospheric,  and
tropospheric errors.  The errors are likely to remain highly correlated within a distance
of 250 km, but such systems are often limited by the data link to an effective range of
around 170 km.  Such systems are usually called local area DGPS (LADGPS) systems.

DGPS  systems  that  compensate  for  accuracy  degradations  over  large  areas  are
referred to as wide area DGPS (WADGPS) systems.  They usually employ a network of
reference receivers that are coordinated to provide DGPS data that is valid over a wide
coverage area.  Such systems typically are designed to broadcast the DGPS data via
satellite,  although  a  network  of  ground  transmission  sites  is  also  feasible.    A  user
receiver  typically  must  employ  special  algorithms  to  derive  the  ionospheric  and
tropospheric  corrections  that  are  appropriate  for  its  location  from  the  observations
taken at the various reference sites.  The U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia
are planning to deploy WADGPS systems transmitting from geostationary satellites for
use by commercial aviation.  The satellites will also provide GPS-like ranging signals. 
Other nations may participate by providing clock corrections only from single sites or
small  networks,  requiring  the  user  to  derive  ionospheric  corrections  from  an
ionospheric model or dual-frequency measurements.  Similar systems limited to military
use have also been discussed.

Some commercial DGPS services broadcast the data from multiple reference stations
via satellite.  However, several such systems remain a group of LADGPS rather than
WADGPS  systems.    This  is  because  the  reference  stations  are  not  integrated  into  a
network,  therefore  the  user  accuracy  degrades  with  distance  from  the  individual
reference sites.  

10.4  SOLUTION ERROR SOURCES

The major sources of range error for nondifferential GPS are:

10-6

1.

Selective  Availability  Errors.    Intentional  SA  degradations  are  applied  to  the
GPS  navigation  signals  to  create  the  SPS  level  of  accuracy.    Two  methods
are  used.    The  first  method,  called  epsilon,  alters  the  ephemeris  (location)
parameters of the satellite to give an apparent shift of satellite position.  The
second  method,  called  dither,  alters  the  satellite  clock  frequency,  thereby
introducing  range  errors  in  the  C/A-code,  P(Y)-code,  and  carrier  signals. 
These errors resemble the naturally occurring ephemeris and clock errors. 

2.

Ionospheric  Delay.    Ionospheric  signal  propagation  delay  can  vary  from
40-60 metres 95% by day to 6-12 metres 95% at night.  This is a particular
problem  with  a single  frequency  user  (i.e.,  a  single  frequency  C/A  code
set).    Dual  frequency  receivers  can  correct  for  ionospheric  delays  with  a
residual error of some 4.5 metres  95%.  The satellite navigation message
contains correction coefficients for  the single frequency user to reduce the
ionospheric delay by appropriate algorithm.

3. Tropospheric  Delay.    This  signal  propagation  delay  is  caused  by
moisture  in  the  lower  atmosphere.    Tropospheric  delay  may  be  up  to  6
metres 95% in magnitude. Many receivers employ algorithms to minimize
this tropospheric delay error.

4. Ephemeris Error.  This error is the difference between the actual satellite
location  and  the  position  predicted  by  satellite  orbital  data.    Normally,
errors will be less than 8.2 metres 95%.

5. Satellite Clock Error.  This error is the difference between actual satellite
GPS time and that predicted by satellite data.  This error is normally less
than 6.5 metres 95%.

DGPS  can  correct  for  the  errors  and  induced  biases  listed  above  in  the  following
manner:

1. Selective  Availability  Errors.    These  errors  are  only  of  concern  to  the
SPS  user.  They  resemble  the  naturally  occurring  ephemeris  and  clock
errors, except that they can be larger in magnitude and can change more
rapidly.    The  epsilon  error  can  be  a  three  dimensional  error.    Therefore,
part of the error will appear as a common range error and part will remain
a residual ephemeris error.  The residual portion is normally small and its
impact  remains  small  for  similar  look  angles  to  the  satellite.  The  dither
error  can  appear  as  a  time  and  frequency  bias.    This  will  be  an  error
common to all receivers and will not be affected by signal propagation or
distance  from  the  satellite.    However,  since  it  is  rapidly  changing,  any
delay between the time of measurement at the reference station and time
of use at the user receiver will result in a residual clock error.  SPS DGPS
systems  are  normally  designed  with  a  rate-of-change 
the
corrections and rapid update rates to minimize this effect.

2.

Ionospheric  and  Tropospheric  Delays.    For  users  near  the  reference
station,  the  respective  signal  paths  to  the  satellites  are  close  enough
together  that  the  compensation  is  almost  complete.    As  the  user  to
reference  station  separation  is  increased,  the  different  ionospheric  and
tropospheric  paths  to  the  satellites  can  be  far  enough  apart  that  the
ionospheric and tropospheric delays are no longer common errors.  Thus,
as  the  distance  between  the  Reference  Station  and  user  receiver
increases the effectiveness of the atmospheric delay corrections decrease.

3. Ephemeris  Error.    This  error  is  effectively  compensated  unless  it  has
quite a large out-of-range  component  (for  example,  1000  metres  or  more
due  to  an  error  in  a  satellite navigation  message).    Even  then,  the  error
will  be  small  if  the  distance  between  the  reference  receiver  and  user
receiver is small.

4. Satellite  Clock  Error.    Except  in  a  satellite  failure  situation,  this  error  is
more slowly changing than the SA dither error.  For all practical purposes,
this error is completely compensated, as long as both reference and user
receivers employ the same satellite clock correction data.

The correlation of the errors experienced at the Reference Station and at the user
location is dependent on the distance between them, but they are normally highly
correlated for a user within 350 km of the Reference Station.  Table 10-1 shows the
error budget for a PPS DGPS system, i.e., there is no added SA error.  The error
budget  assumes  that  the  common  range  error  sources  due  to  the  Space  and
Control Segment are eliminated in a PPS DGPS system.

Atmospheric  errors  can  be  eliminated  if  the  user  is  close  to  the  reference  station,
but  if  they  are  more  than  250  km  apart,  the  user  will  obtain  better  results  using
correction models for ionospheric and tropospheric delay.  250 km is a reasonable

10-8

division  between  near  and  far.    Table  10-1  above  also  shows  how  the  reference
station  receiver  noise  and  multipath  errors  are  included  in  the  differential
corrections and become part of the user's error budget (root-sum-squared with the
user receiver noise and multipath errors).

10.5  SYSTEM BLOCK DIAGRAM

Figures  10-2  and  10-3  show  an  example  reference  station  and  DGPS  user
equipment.    Two  receivers  are  shown  at  the  Reference  Station  to  increase  the
station reliability and to provide station integrity.  Nominally each receiver will track
all  satellites  in  view  in  order  to  assure  that  differential  corrections  are  determined
for all satellites.  With the full GPS constellation as many as eight to ten satellites
may be in view.  If eight satellites are visible, the reference station would have to
broadcast  data  for  8  satellites.    If  SPS  equipment  is  used,  the  broadcast  can  be
unencrypted.    If  PPS  equipment  is  used,  the  transmission  of  SA  corrected  errors
requires the use of an encrypted data link.

From  a  military  standpoint,  DGPS  no  longer  remains  a  passive  system.    DGPS
transmitters have a limited range application (up to about 800 km).  There will also
be increased system cost for communications and processing equipment.

10.6  DGPS INTEGRITY

DGPS  does  more  than  increase  positioning  accuracy,  it  also  enhances  GPS
integrity  by  compensating  for  anomalies  in  the  satellite  ranging  signals  and
navigation  data  message.  The  range  and  range  rate  corrections  provided  in  the
ranging-code  DGPS  correction  message  can  compensate  for  ramp  and  step  type
anomalies  in  the  individual  satellite  signals,  until  the  corrections  exceed  the
maximum  values  or  rates  allowed  in  the  correction  format.  If  these  limits  are
exceeded, the user can be warned not to use a particular satellite by placing "do-
not-use" bit patterns in the corrections for that satellite (as defined in or RTCM SC-
104  message  formats)  or  by  omitting  the  corrections  for  that  satellite.    Step
anomalies  will  normally  cause  carrier-phase  DGPS  receivers  to  lose  lock  on  the
carrier  phase,  causing  the  reference  and  user  receivers  to  reinitialize.    User
receiver noise, user processing anomalies, and multipath at the user GPS antenna
cannot  be  corrected  by  a  DGPS  system.  These  errors  are  normally  small  and
included in the overall DGPS error budget.

Errors in determining or transmitting the satellite corrections may be passed on to
the differential user if integrity checks are not provided within the reference station.
 These errors can include inaccuracies in the reference station antenna location(s)
that bias the corrections, systematic multipath due to poor antenna sighting (usually
in  low  elevation  angle  satellites),  algorithmic  errors,  receiver  interchannel  bias
errors, receiver clock errors, and communication errors.  For these reasons, DGPS
reference  station  designs 
to
guarantee the validity of the corrections before and after broadcast.

the  measurements/corrections  sufficiently 

required  in  the  user  receiver  when  DGPS  corrections  are  utilized  in  the  position
solution.    As  described  above,  the  DGPS  measurements/corrections  ensure  the
integrity of the corrected measurements used by the user receiver.  If the reference
station  validates 
the
broadcast  UERE,  the  only  other  place  an  integrity  problem  can  occur  is  the  user
receiver.  The user receiver can perform internal validity checks, other than RAIM,
on its measurements and processing to detect any internal integrity problems.  In a
wide  area  DGPS  system,  RAIM  may  be  useful  to  detect  extreme  ionospheric  or
tropospheric  errors,  if  the  desired  differential  accuracy  can  be  degraded  by  these
effects.

to  guarantee 

Information  provided  in  a  correction  message  includes  the  measurement  time  of
each  correction  and  the  "Issue  Of  Data"  (IOD)  of  the  Ephemeris  that  was  used  to
determine the corrections.  It should also include a UDRE value for each satellite. 
The significance of these parameters is explained in the following paragraphs.

Most differential user receivers check the measurement times to automatically stop
using  reference  station  measurements  (corrections)  that  exceed  a  predetermined
age.    DGPS  position  error  increases  as  the  measurement  age  increases  because
the  reference  station  and  user  errors  decorrelate  with  time.    A  user  receiver
propagates  ranging-code  corrections  to  the  current  time  using  the  range  rate
corrections  or  propagates  its  own  carrier-phase  measurements  to  the  reference
station measurement time.  This decreases the effect of the measurement age, but
does  not  eliminate  it.    The  major  change  in  SPS  measurements  is  due  to  SA. 
Consequently, the time for SPS measurements to become completely decorrelated
is around two minutes.  The major change in PPS measurements is due to satellite
geometry.  Therefore,  PPS  measurements  can  remain  correlated  for  10  minutes  or
more.

In order to maintain the integrity of a DGPS position solution, all corrections must
be  provided  by  the  same  reference  station  or  by  time-synchronized  reference
stations.    This  is  because  the  correction  values  are  dependent  on  the  reference
station  clock.    Mixing  corrections  from  unsynchronized  reference  stations  can
generate unpredictable clock and range errors in the user receiver.

The corrections must also be based on the same IOD values that the user receiver
is using.  If the ephemeris data used to develop the corrections is different than the
ephemeris data used in the user receiver, then the magnitude of the corrections will
be invalid.

The UDRE is the differential equivalent of the URE for uncorrected satellites.  It is a
statistical  measure  of  the  expected  residual  range  error  after  the  corrections  are
applied. The correction UDRE values can be used in conjunction with the satellite
geometry  to  calculate  an  estimate  of  the  differential  position  error.    The  user
receiver contribution to the total User Equivalent Differential Range Error (UEDRE)
must also be considered in the  position error calculations. (Different receivers can
have different measurement errors.) If the reference station validates the broadcast
UDRE values, the position error estimates can be used as an integrity check, much
in the same way that RAIM is used by nondifferential  receivers.  That is, estimates
of  the  user  position  accuracy  can  be  periodically  compared  against  the  minimum

10-11

mission  requirements.    The  advantage  of  the  differential  method  is  that  an
overdetermined  position  solution  (additional  range  measurements)  is  not  required
as  in  RAIM  to  maintain  positioning  integrity.    If  the  number  of  available  satellite
corrections  exceeds  the  number  of  tracking  channels  in  the  user  receiver,  these
position error estimates can also be used to select the set of satellites that provide
the most accurate position solution.  Normally, the "all-in-view" position solution is
most  accurate,  and  the  correction  UDRE  values  are  near  the  same  magnitude.    If
one  or  more  corrections  have  a  relatively  large  UDRE,  a  subset  of  the  satellites
may provide a more accurate solution.

The  standard  maritime  DGPS  design,  being  implemented  by  several  countries
throughout  the  world,  includes  a  differential  user  receiver  located  at  a  nearby
surveyed site to serve as an integrity monitor.  The integrity monitor receives and
applies  the  corrections  and  develops  a  differential  position  solution  in  the  same
manner  as  any  other  user  receiver.    This  position  solution  is  then  compared  with
the  known  antenna  location.    If  the  difference  exceeds  the  allowed  differentially-
corrected  position  error,  the  transmission  of  all  corrections  is  terminated.    A
message  is  also  sent  to  the  users  warning  them  to  stop  using  all  previously
transmitted  corrections.    Although  this  method  protects  well  against  large  sudden
errors, rigorous integrity is only provided for a user that determines a position using
the same set of satellite corrections as the integrity monitor (typically the full set). 
Receivers  that  use  only  a  subset  of  the  satellites  and  transmitted  corrections  will
have  a  higher  DOP  value  for  position  determination  and  may  have  a  significantly
greater position error than the integrity monitor.

A  more  effective  integrity  method  is  to  check  the  integrity  of  each  individual
correction in the range domain, rather than the position domain, providing integrity
for users of any correction subset.  This method also uses multiple receivers in the
reference station (a minimum of two), but each receiver generates an independent
set  of  corrections.    The  receivers  also  use  different  antennas,  sited  a  sufficient
distance apart that multipath effects are likely to be independent as well.  The two
sets  of  corrections  are  directly  compared  prior  to  transmission.    The  difference
between  each  pair  of  corrections  is  a  direct  measurement  of  most  of  the
components  of  the  actual  instantaneous  differential  range  error  seen  by  the  user
receiver.    If  a  pair  of  corrections  disagree  by  more  than  a  predetermined  amount,
for  example,  3  X  UDRE  (that  is,  3-sigma  UDRE),  correction  transmissions  are
interrupted  for  that  satellite.    In  this  way,  the  user  does  not  receive  or  use  any
corrections until the integrity is checked, and the user can have confidence that the
broadcast  UDRE  is  a  true  measure  of  the  expected  range  error.    The  reference
station  also  has  the  ability  to  continue  broadcasting  the  corrections  that  remain
valid.    This  technique  is  particularly  useful  for  applications  that  must  meet  short
integrity  warning  times,  must  provide  a  highly  confident  estimate  of  UDRE,  must
minimize  service  interruptions,  or  that  have  slow  correction  transmission  rates.
Additional  enhancements  to  this  technique  can  include  the  use  of  dissimilar
receivers  to  prevent  common-mode  errors  within  the  reference  station,  the  use  of
more than two receivers to "vote-out" anomalous measurements, or the calculation
of an "average" correction between the reference station receivers.

10-12

Most  of  these  integrity  considerations  apply  equally  to  DGPS  systems  that  base
their  corrections  on  SPS  or  PPS  data.    The  primary  difference  is  that  the  PPS
corrections  can  be  propagated  for  a  longer  time  since  the  measurements  are  not
influenced by SA-induced errors.

CHAPTER 11:  SPECIAL APPLICATIONS FOR NAVSTAR GPS

11.1  INTRODUCTION

Navstar GPS is a positioning system that will be a definite force enhancer in military
operations.  Since GPS will also be available to civilian users and has the potential to
enhance military  operations  other  than  weapon  delivery,  several  special  applica tions
for  GPS  have  been  developed.    This  chapter  will  discuss  four  special  applications
already developed to indicate the variety of GPS uses.  The four special applications
discussed are as follows:

DGPS Applications

1.
2. GPS used as an attitude reference system
3.
4. Orbit determination using GPS

Precise time and GPS

11.2  DGPS APPLICATIONS

11.2.1  Potential Uses of DGPS

DGPS  can  be  used  for  a  variety  of  applications.    Some  of  these  applications  will  be
discussed in this chapter. 








Instrument approach
All weather helicopter operations
Narrow channel maritime operations
Reference Station for testing/calibration of navigation equipment
Surveying for mapping and positioning
Blind take-off

11.2.1.1  Instrument Approach

Most  established  airfields  have  sufficient  landing  instrumentation,  however,  during
major conflicts, GPS can be used as an approach aid to temporary airfields. The GPS
PPS  accuracies  are  adequate  to  provide  non-precision  approach  guidance  to  any
landing  location  in  the  world,  providing  the  coordinates  of  the  runway  end  are
accurately known.  The use of DGPS would allow even better accuracy and may allow
lower descent limits to a smaller landing area.  The DGPS system can be set up almost
immediately to provide very accurate guidance to any runway threshold.

11.2.1.2  All Weather Helicopter Operations

Helicopters are required to operate almost anywhere under all weather conditions, day
or night.  DGPS is used to give helicopters improved position and height information
when maneuvering close to the ground and in close proximity to obstacles.

11-1

11.2.1.3  Narrow Channel Maritime Operations

There  are  two  types  of  narrow  maritime  channels  -  natural  confined  waters  and
channels swept through mine fields.  Large ships, both military and civilian, will operate
in both types of narrow channels in wartime and will need all the position accuracy they
can get.  Use of DGPS will reduce the requirement for the width of the channel to be
swept.

11.2.1.4  Reference Station for Testing/Calibration of Navigation Equipment

A  Reference  Station  can  provide  the  "ground  truth"  necessary  for  testing  GPS  and
other navigation equipment.  It can also be used to calibrate other terrestrial navigation
system transmitters such as Loran-C and Omega.

11.2.1.5  Surveying for Mapping and Positioning

The use of DGPS to collect data for post -processing (not real-time DGPS) is a common
operating  method  for  mapping  and  geograph ical  surveying  purposes.    The  usual
method is to use one mobile GPS receiver, one stationary reference GPS receiver, plus
the necessary data recording and data processing equipment.  The mobile receiver is
moved  around  to  those  points  that  will  be  surveyed.    GPS  data  (pseudoranges  and
deltaranges)  are  collected  at  both  receivers  and  the  actual  DGPS  process  is  done
when the data from the two receivers is brought together at a later time.  This technique
eliminates the data link; despite this, very  accurate DGPS data can be obtained within
minutes of data collection.

11.2.1.6  Blind Take-Off

GPS is inherently most accurate in the horizontal plane.  If the horizontal accuracy is
enhanced  by  DGPS  techniques,  an  aircraft  could  use  the  improved  accura cy  to
navigate down a runway for take-off in zero/zero conditions.

11.2.2  DGPS Data Link

The  transfer  of  data  from  the  reference  receiver  to  the  mobile  receiver  can  be  done
using  any  communication  system  capable  of  transfer ring  digital  data.    It  can  be  via
telephone  lines,  radio  or  satellite  communications.    Military  users  of  a  data  link  may
wish to consider encrypting the link to provide protection from imitation of the signal. 
Once  the  data  is  received,  it  can  be  loaded  into  the  receiver  by  using  existing
interfaces such as the Instrumentation Port (IP), a MIL -STD-1553 data bus, or a special
interface dedicated to DGPS data.

The  use  of  pseudolites  transmitting  GPS  NAV  msg  "look  alike"  data  on  L1  or  L2
excludes  the  need  for  extra  radio  equipment  on  the  user  vehicle.    The  range  of
operation will also be very limited due to the high frequency of the pseudolite signals. 
The problem with pseudolites is that because of their high signal power relative to the
received  satellite  signals,  they  can  "jam"  the  user  receiver  if  the  receiver  comes  too
close  to  the  pseudolite.  The  user  will  then  only  receive  the  Reference  Station
(pseudolite) signals and not the satellite signals.

11-2

The solution to this problem is to transmit the pseudolite data in very short pulses so
the user will appear to be "jammed" during short time intervals.

One  proposed  differential  service  is  to  broadcast  GPS  like  data  on  L1  from  geo -
synchronous  satellites.    Compatible  receivers  would  interpret  these  signals  as  an
additional GPS satellite and read the differential correction data for all other satellites. 
The receivers would require a channel dedicated to receiving these corrections.  This
data link would provide coverage to wide areas of the earth and have the added benefit
of providing additional satellite ranging methods to improve satellite availability.

11.3  GPS USED AS AN ATTITUDE REFERENCE SYSTEM

11.3.1  Introduction

Angular orientation in 3 dimensions is frequently determined using inertial sensors.  A
GPS  receiver  with  two  or  more  antennas  has  the  capability  to  be  used  for  real-time
angular reference.

Simulations and studies indicate that it will be cheaper and more accurate to use GPS
for attitude reference than to use inertial sensors.  Also, GPS attitude accuracy will not
degrade with time.  Combining GPS and inertial sensors for attitude reference would
give  the  user  the  best  of  both  worlds.      Firstly,  GPS  will  give  very  precise  angular
measurements  under  normal  conditions  and  could  provide  updates  to  the  inertial
sensors, both for the wander in the gyros and the platform tilt error.  Secondly, if the
GPS receiver is jammed, the inertial sensors would still provide position, velocity and
attitude.  It could also be used to initialize the GPS receiver when the jamming is over.

11.3.2  Concept of Operation

The basic concept of operation for using GPS as an attitude reference system involves
using  various  types  of  differencing  techniques  in  conjunction  with  interferometry. 
Single differencing virtually eliminates the sensitivity of the antenna position errors to
ephemeris, satellite clock, ionospheric and tropospheric error since they are common to
both antenna positions.  Double differencing eliminates the sensitivity to receiver clock
biases.

A GPS interferometer measures the satellite carrier signal phase difference as it arrives
at two different antenna locations.  The two antennas, placed a distance "d" apart will
receive the carrier signal at a different time and therefore with a different phase, see
Figure 11-1.

11-3

11-4

 
 

Data processing unit
Common reference oscillator

Another simpler alternative is to use one 8-channel P(Y) -code receiver and 3 antennas.

Four-channels would operate as a sub -receiver and would be dedicated to one master
antenna.    The  sub-receiver  and  the  master  antenna  read  the  NAV  msg  and  provide
position  and  velocity  information  for  use  when  processing  the  signals  from  the  other
two  antennas.  This  method  can  be  used  if  the  baselines  between  the  antennas  are
sufficiently  short  to  assume  the  position  and  velocity  measure ments  are  nearly  the
same  for  all  three  antenna  locations.    The  two  other  antennas  would  only  use  2-
channels each to do carrier phase measurements on two of the four satellites that the
"master" antenna was tracking.  Which of the two satellites all three antennas would be
tracking  depends  on  the  satellite  geometry  relative  to  the  antennas.    The  technique
requires  that  the  measurement  data  is  processed  as  if  all  satellite  signals  were
received  at  the  same  time.    Under  high  HV  dynamics,  the  INS -derived  angular
information may be better than GPS.

11.3.4  Use of Multiple Receivers and a Reference Oscillator

When multiple receivers are used for interferometry it is recommended that a common
external reference oscillator be used for all the receivers, otherwise the oscillators in
each receiver must be calibrated.  A common frequency reference would improve the
accuracy of attitude measurements because all phase measurements would be  done
using the same time reference and thereby eliminate "own clock errors".

11.3.5  Error Sources and Degradation of Performance

The most dominant error sources are as follows:







Absolute position uncertainty
PDOP
Antenna location
Antenna position difference uncertainty in the body frame
Measurement accuracy

11.3.5.1  Absolute Position Uncertainty

Errors  in  knowledge  of  the  absolute  position  of  the  primary  antenna  can  cause  an
angular orientation error in the local -level frame with which attitude is referenced.  This
orientation error transforms into an equivalent attitude error.  Typical attitude errors of
less than 0.03 minutes of arc can be expected.

11-5

11.3.5.2  PDOP

The  attitude  determination  accuracy  is  influenced  by  the  satellite  geometry  the  same
way as position accuracy.  Poor satellite geometry results in less accurate position and
attitude determination.

11.3.5.3  Antenna Location

Antenna  location  errors  are  a  minimum  when  the  two  position  difference  vectors  are
orthogonal.  Simulation results indicate that acceptable performance can be obtained
when  the  vectors  intersect  at  an  angle  between  45  degrees  and  135  degrees.    The
performance deteriorates rapidly outside this domain.

11.3.5.4  Antenna Position Difference Uncertainty in the Body Frame

Uncertainty of the difference vectors in body -coordinates  is  a  function  of  two  primary
factors:  body  flexure  and  errors  inherit ed  from  the  calibration  process.    Body  flexure
alters the relative position between antennas, hence causing errors.

11.3.5.5  Measurement Accuracy and Error Budget

The  most  significant  factor  influencing  the  feasibility  of  GPS  attitude  measurement  is
the  accuracy  of  the  range  difference  measurement.    The  error  sources  affecting
accuracy are as follows:

Atmospheric delays

1.
2. Multipath effects which can be quite significant, but can be largely negated

by proper antenna placement
Phase difference measurement accuracy
Transmission delay stability

3.
4.

Very  little  is  published  about  what  accuracies  can  be  expected  when  using  GPS  for
attitude reference, but one manufacturer claims a heading accuracy of 0.3 degree, roll
and pitch accuracy of 1.0 degree, updated at a 20 Hz rate with no practical speed limit,
a maximum acceleration of 10 G, and a maximum angular velocity of 30 degrees/sec. 
The same manufacturer claims a heading accuracy of 0.05 degrees within 5 minutes in
a  stationary  mode.    This  performance  is  with  a  C/A-code  receiver,  using  3  antennas
placed  in  a  triangle  with  57  cm  baseline  between  the  antennas.    Generally,  the
measurement  accuracy  depends  on  baseline  length  and  measurement  time.    Longer
baselines and longer measurement times will improve the accuracy.

11-6

11.4  PRECISE TIME AND GPS

11.4.1  Introduction

Precise  time  is  important  for  a  growing  number  of  military,  civilian,  and  scientific
applications.    Precise  time  references  accurate  to  a  few  milliseconds  or  better  have
historically been complicated and costly to obtain, but GPS will afford the means to do
it  very  simply  and  economically.    Navstar  GPS  provides  precise  time,  globally,  to  an
absolute  accuracy  of  approximately  200  nanoseconds  (ns)  relative  to  UTC  (USNO). 
(This figure and others given in 11.3 and its subsections are subject to implemen tation
factors and might be considered usual values; with careful implementations and under
circumstances, much better accuracies are possible.)

11.4.2  Applications of Precise Time

Both  scientific  and  civilian  precise-time  interests  can  be  served  by  GPS.    Some
examples of civilian/scientific applications are described below:

Simultaneous observations of space objects from observatories

Research into the theory of general relativity

Development and calibration of frequency standards

Use  of  Time  Division  Multiplexed  (TDM)  and  other  communications
disciplines requiring precise time coordination between sites.

11.4.3  Interrelationship Between Different Definitions of Time

A number of different time definitions will be described here.

11.4.3.1  Time Based on the Rotation of the Earth On Its Axis

There are several definitions of time based on the rotation of the earth, but they are all
interrelated (see Figure 11-2).

1.

Universal Time (UT)

UT  is  mean  solar    time  on  the    Greenwich  meridian.    It  is    used  in  the
application of astronomical navigation.

2.

Universal Time 0 (UT 0)

11-7

     UT  0  is  determined  directly  from  astronomical  observations.    It  is
non-uniform  due  to  the  irregular  rotation  of  the  earth  on  its  axis  and  to
polar motion.

3.

Universal Time 1 (UT 1)

UT 1 is UT 0 corrected for polar motion and is     therefore    more  uniform
than UT 0.  UT 1 is the same as Greenwich Mean Time.

4.

Universal Time 2 (UT 2)

UT 2 is UT 1 corrected for mean seasonal variations and is therefore more
uniform than UT 1.

Figure 11-2.  The Interrelationship of the Different Methods of

Measuring and Defining Time

11.4.3.2  Atomic Time/UTC Time

Atomic  time  is  based  on  quantified  energy  transitions  within  the  atom.    The  atomic
second  is  defined  as  9192631770  cycles  of  the  cesium  resonance  and  is  the  unit  of
time used in International Systems of Units (SI).  Atomic time is obtained practically by
use of  cesium beam clocks.  However, no practical clock can be considered perfect at

11-8

deriving the defined frequency.  UTC is a type of atomic time maintained by the U.S.
Naval Observatory (USNO), and others.  UTC is occasionally adjusted in steps (leap
seconds) to maintain agreement with UT -1 to within 0.9 seconds.  Leap seconds are
necessary  because  of  the  effects  on  UT -1  of  the  irregular  rotation  of  the  earth  over
time.  The International Earth Rotation Service in Paris, France determines when step
adjustments are necessary.  A number of observatories/ laboratories maintain atomic
clocks as very precise time references. They usually synchronize these clocks to UTC,
which is the commonly used reference time. UTC repre sents an average of time from
58  different  laboratories  around  the  world.    Each  major  country    maintains  its  own
version  of  UTC  and  defines  national  standards  of  time.  Therefore,  there  is  no  one
"Coordinated  Universal  Time".    Instead,  there  is  an  Inter national  Atomic  Time  (TAI),
kept in Paris by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), and several
versions  of  UTC.    The  TAI  is  a  weighted  average  of  the  times  kept  by  the  58
laboratories which cooperate with BIPM to form this average.  For the past few years,
the majority of time comparisons used to form TAI have been done using GPS.  The
difference  between  TAI  and  the  various  national  UTC  time  references  are  closely
monitored  and  are  therefore  well  known.    National  UTC  references  will  therefore  be
steered  to  TAI  when  necessary  and  for  GPS  users,  steering  of  UTC  (USNO)  will  be
experienced once every couple of years.  For U.S. agencies, UTC is maintained by the
U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) in Washington, D.C.  GPS time is required by the U.S.
DoD to be referenced to UTC (USNO).

11.4.3.3  GPS Time

The  internal  reference  time  used  by  the  three  segments  (Space -,  Control-  and  User-
Segment) in the GPS system is called GPS time.  GPS time is a continuous time count,
with no discontinuities, from the GPS epoch.  GPS time is estimated and main tained by
the MCS by estimating the ensemble satellite and monitor station time off sets.  To aid
USNO  in  providing  a  stable  and  accurate  reference  to  the  system,  an  ensemble  of
cesium-beam clocks is also maintained at the GPS Monitor Station that is collocat ed
with the MCS.  As a Precise Time Reference Station, it main tains time and rate very
accurately traceable to UTC (USNO).  It normally maintains a UTC (USNO) reference
to an accuracy of a few nanoseconds.  GPS time will normally be steered to within 30
nanoseconds  of  UTC  (USNO)  after  accounting  for  the  leap  seconds  which  have
accumulated  in  UTC  since  the  GPS  epoch  of  0  hours  6  January  1980  (UTC).    The
remaining  difference  between  GPS  time  and  UTC  (USNO)  is  trans mitted  in  the  NAV
msgs from the satellites.  The relationship between GPS time and UTC is:

GPS time = UTC time + DUTC time

where, DUTC time = Number of leap seconds + GPS-to-UTC bias

As of May 1995 the leap second difference between GPS and UTC is 10 seconds.  The
GPS receiver uses the NAV msg data to provide UTC (USNO) time outputs.

11.4.4  Precise Time Dissemination from GPS

GPS satellites have highly stable atomic clocks onboard with a known or predictable
offset from GPS time.  USNO monitors all the satellites when in view of the USNO in

11-9

Washington DC, U.S.A. and compares the GPS time and UTC (USNO) time trans mitted
by  the  satellites  with  the  (USNO)  Master  Clock.    Based  on  this  compari son  USNO
determines  the  accuracy  of  the  GPS/UTC  time  information  provided  by  each  GPS
satellite and transfers this information to the MCS (see Figure 11-3).  This GPS to UTC
time bias and drift offsets, as well as the number of leap seconds, are uploaded in the
satellite  almanac  data  message.  This  information  is  used  in  the  GPS  receiver
algorithms to determine UTC (USNO) time from GPS.  The result is a world - wide time
reference system for UTC (USNO) available to every user of GPS (see Figure 11-4). 
The absolute time accuracy available to the user depends on several factors described
in  Table  11-1,  but  the  relative  time  accuracy  between  two  GPS  users  can  be  much
better than the absolute time accuracy.  If the stations simultaneously  track  the  same
 GPS  satellites  for  time  dissemination,  then the effects of certain Control Segment
and  satellite-induced  errors  on  the  relative  time  accuracy  are  much  reduced,  and
relative  time  accuracy  can  be  as  good  as  10 -20  ns.    Almost  all  users  employ  loc al
clocks  or  oscillators  of  some  kind  to  satisfy  system  requirements  for  long -  and
short-term accuracy and stability, or to avoid the need for continuous updates from an
external  reference,  such  as  GPS.    Slaving  the  clocks  too  tightly  to  GPS  time  would
impart to them the shorter-term instability associated with reception and interpretation
of  GPS  signals  and  with  the  instabilities  previously  mentioned.    Longer -term
measurements  that  are  required  to  obtain  an  accurate  rate  or  frequency  would  not
enjoy the short-term advantage of simultaneous tracking, since over a period of time,
most  of  the  space  and  Control  Segment  functions  would  effect  the  stability  of  the
dissemination function.

To use the GPS time-dissemination service, one must track one GPS satellite (if in a

absolute  UTC  accuracies  that  the  user  can  expect  are  presented  in  Table  11-2  and
depend predominately on the following:






How  accurately  the  receiver  antenna  p osition  is  known  (if  tracking  1
satellite)
Whether a C/A- or P(Y)-code receiver is used
Whether  the  user  can  "smooth"  the  measurements  or  has  to  use  "raw"
data.

11.4.4.1  Precise Time Dissemination Under Dynamic Conditions

Precise time accuracy degrades under dynamic conditions for two main reasons:

1.

Temporary changes in the GPS receiver clock rate due to g-sensitivity

11-12

2.

Reduced  accuracy  of  the  GPS  receiver  Kalman  filter  operation  due  to
non-linear HV dynamics during each Kalman filter calculation cycle.

All  oscillators  are  sensitive  to  accelerations.    The  requirement  for  a  military  GPS
receiver's  crystal  oscillator  is  in  the  order  of  a  maximum  rate  offset  of    2  nano -
seconds/second/g on two axes and a maximum of 3 nanoseconds/second/g on the third
axis.    If  the  receiver's  measurement  cycle  is  one  second,  a  4.5  g  acceleration  will
therefore  result  in  9  nanoseconds  of  time  error  on  one  of  the  "better"  axes.    The
Kalman  filter  in  the  receiver  will  also  contribute  with  a  time  error  due  to  the  less
accurate satellite tracking and therefore PVT dilution under dynamic conditions.  This
error is about 2 nanoseconds/second/g.  The total time error under dynamic conditions
is assumed to be approximately 20 ns greater than in the static mode.

11.4.4.2  Reduced Time Accuracy Due to SA

When SA is used by GPS, the  pseudorange errors and therefore the position, velocity,
and  time  errors  will  increase  for  a  SPS  receiver.    This  reduced  pseudorange
measurement accuracy will degrade the horizontal position to 100 m (95%).  

The relevance for the time accuracy available from a SPS receiver is as follows:

1.

2.

100  m  (95%)  horizontal  position  error  is  equivalent  to  31.3  m  UERE  for
each of the pseudoranges used in the navigation solution in the receiver.

A user in a known location using only one satellite for the time transfer will
experience a time error of:

31.3
3x108

[m]
[m/s]

= 104 ns (1s ) = 204 ns (95%)

If the user is at an unknown location and uses 4 satellites, then his total time error due
to geometry, SA and receiver errors will be:

104 ns * TDOP = 104 * 1.7 = 175 ns (Typical TDOP value)

SA will reduce the accuracy for SPS precise time dissemina tion to users of GPS, but
the effect can be reduced by smoothing the time measurements.  Also for SPS users,
the  relative  timekeeping  accuracy  normally  realized  by  observing  the  same  satellites
would be adversely affected by SA.  The timing provided to them would be irregular,
and their clocks would not be able to track it well.  An alternative is to perform coordi -
nated  time  transfer  operations  with  USNO  or  another  laboratory  that  maintains
adequate  traceability  to  UTC  (USNO);  because  of  the  time -varying  nature  of  SA,  the
coordination may need to be closer than it would under non -SA conditions.

11-13

11.4.5  Time Transfer Using GPS

Time transfers (clock comparisons) may be made in a number of ways using the GPS
satellites.  The time dissemination process described in paragraph 11.4.4 is a "passive"
method,  in  which  the  user  acquires  an  accurate  time  reference  without  having  to
transmit  timing  signals  or  data.    Other  ways  that  can  provide  more  accu rate
comparisons are described in this section.

11.4.5.1  Coordinated Simultaneous-View Time Transfer

In  this  method,  a  pair  of  stations  simultaneously  observes  the  same  satellite(s);  then
(through  some  communications  medium)  they  exchange  readings  of  their  local  clock
time against the time disseminated by GPS.  The difference between these readings is
quite  accurately  the  difference  between  the  stations'  clocks.    The  satellite  clock  is
primarily a transfer clock and does not directly affect the time transfer accuracy.  This
method might be used where the user clocks are required to maintain time or frequency
agreement more precisely than UTC can be disseminated through GPS.  The method
works  particularly  well  when  the  participating  clocks  are  located  reasonably  close
together  (within  some  hundreds  of  kilometers).    The  method  can  also  substan tially
reduce  the  effects  of  S/A  on  time  transfers  made  with  the  C/A-code,  because  both
ephemeris and ionospheric effects are reduced. Unless the time transfer is made with
USNO or a UTC(USNO)-traceable reference, the result is relative rather than absolute
time accuracy.

11.4.5.2  Coordinated Simultaneous-View Time Transfer with USNO

USNO  uses  a  coordinated  simultaneous -view  method  as  shown  in  Figure  11-5,  to
provide  more  accurate  UTC(USNO) 
to  certain  Pre cise  Time  Stations  within
simultaneous-view range.  Both USNO and the distant observer track the same GPS
satellite(s),  derive  UTC  (USNO)  from  the  satellite's  NAV  msg  and  pseudorange
measurements,  and  compare  this  time  with  the  time  maintained  by  t heir  local  atomic
clocks.  USNO compares UTC (USNO) derived from the GPS satellites with the USNO
Master Clock.  Thus, USNO can deter mine the Control Segment and Satellite - induced
errors  that  the  observer  will  have  in  his  GPS -derived  UTC(USNO).    The  distant
observer can then correct his GPS derived UTC (USNO) with correc tions received from
USNO via a data link.  Now the distant observer can correct his clock very accurately to
serve as a local reference traceable to UTC (USNO). The time accuracies that can be
obtained by this method are shown in Table 11-1.  The Table 11 -1 values are valid for
time  transfer  using  C/A-code  only  when  SA  is  switched  off.  Smoothing  of  the  time
measurements brings the error down to what can be expected for a P-code receiver.

The errors due to ephemeris uncertainties and ionospheric delay usually cancel out of
if the two receivers are close to each other.  This is because they have nearly the same
line of sight to the satellites, and the signals travel through the same part of the iono -
sphere.  In some cases where the two receivers are close to each other, the use of both
L1 and L2 to compensate for ionospheric delay will be less accurate than not correcting
for ionospheric delay at all.  This is due to the fact that dual frequency com pensation
for ionospheric delay is not perfect, and use of the ionospheric delay broad cast by the
satellite  by  both  parties  produces  more  accurate  results.    For  most  cases  where

11-14

characters  per  second  is  used  for  coordinated  simultaneous -view  time  transfer,  the
average of the values listed in Table 11-2 can be expected with distances of hundreds
of kilometers between two receivers.

Compared with the uncoordinated simultaneous -view technique described in paragraph
11.4.4,  coordinated  time  transfers  with  USNO  can  provide  not  only  more  accurate
relative timing in the shorter term, but also better absolute timing and better long -term
stability for setting and rating high -quality clocks.

11.5  SATELLITE ORBIT DETERMINATION USING GPS

Precise satellite orbit determination can be done using GPS receivers on a satellite. 
These spaceborne GPS receivers must be specifically qualified for space use, because
of the high temperature extremes and radiation levels.  The space applications would
be limited to low earth orbit satellites in order to receive adequate coverage from the
half geosynchronous orbit of the GPS constellation.  In addition to orbit determination,
the  spaceborne  GPS  receivers  could  be  used  to  determine  the  spacecraft  attitude. 
Preliminary  studies  and  demonstrations  have  shown  that  using  GPS  for  autonomous
spacecraft  position  and  attitude  determination  can  be  done  cheaper  and  more
accurately than some of the current methods.

CHAPTER 12:  GPS INTEGRITY AND CIVIL AVIATION

12.1 INTRODUCTION

The  civil  aviation  view  of  GPS  is  significantly  different  than  that  of  most  military
users. The primary technical difference is that SPS C/A-code will be the only GPS
signal available to most civil aviation users.  Therefore, the civil aviation user must
consider the reduced accuracy and statistical accuracy variations induced by SA. 
Consequently,  civilian  users  are  planning  to  use  augmentations,  for  example,
differential GPS, to improve the accuracy and availability of the SPS signals.

for  navigation  and  position  reporting  where  safety-of-life 

The  primary  difference  in  use  of  GPS  is  that  civil  aviation  will  use  GPS  almost
exclusively 
is  of
tantamount  importance.  Therefore,  integrity  of  the  position  solution  is  also  of
tantamount  importance.    Military  users  take  a  broader  view  of  GPS  as  a  force
enhancement  that  will  include  peacetime  as  well  as  wartime  operations  and
manned as well as unmanned missions.  Therefore, military integrity requirements
can  vary  widely  depending  on  the  mission,  and  can  range,  for  example,  from  the
extreme  concern  of  safety-of-life  for  manned  peacetime  operations  to  lesser
requirements for weapon effectiveness in a war-fighting environment.

Civil aviation also views GPS as a major component of a Global Navigation Satellite
System  (GNSS).    The  GNSS  concept  also  includes  the  Russian  Global  Orbiting
Navigation  Satellite  System  (GLONASS),  geostationary  satellites  broadcasting
GPS-  and/or  GLONASS-like  signals,  and  a  possible  international  civil  navigation
satellite system.  In this respect, it is likely that the civil aviation community will field
systems that accept signals from more than one component of the GNSS to improve
the overall accuracy, availability, and integrity of the civil positioning solution.

GPS  and  GNSS  equipment  for  civil  aviation  will  range  from  minimum-capability
stand-alone  receivers  for  general  aviation  users,  to  sophisticated  integrated
navigation systems for commercial users.

The primary benefit of GPS and GNSS from a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) point-
of-view is that GPS/GNSS has the potential to replace many existing ground-based
radio navigation aids or obviate the need to procure new systems, thereby reducing
the  cost  of  maintaining  or  acquiring  these  systems.    This  is  especially  true  for
developing  nations  that  do  not  have  an  extensive  navaid  infrastructure,  and  who
could instead provide a regional integrity supplement to GPS (or GNSS) at a much
lower cost than a traditional VOR navaid infrastructure.

The primary benefits of GPS and GNSS from a user point-of-view are potential fuel
(cost)  savings  from  more  direct  routing,  improved  (global)  navigational  coverage,
and  the  potential  to  replace  multiple  navigation  systems  with  a  multi-use  system. 
The  primary  concerns  stem  from  the  safety-of-life  issue  and  the  fact  that  GPS
signal  failures  can  affect  large  areas  and  consequently  large  numbers  of  aircraft
simultaneously.

12.2  MILITARY USE OF NATIONAL AIRSPACE

Many  NATO  nations  require  military  aircraft  to  meet  civilian  flight  certification
requirements  and  carry  the  necessary  navigation  equipments  if  they  operate  in
controlled  airspace  without  specific  approval  from  the  appropriate  authorities. 
Military use of national airspace is usually a cooperative effort between the military
services and the CAA of the particular nation.  For example in the U.S., equipment,
operational  requirements,  and  flight  certification  are  performed  by  the  individual
services,  although  some  military  aircraft  maintain  civilian  flight  certification  and
meet  all  civilian  requirements.    Military  aircraft  do  not  necessarily  have  the  same
integrity  requirements  as  civilian  aircraft,  especially  tactical  aircraft  that  do  not
normally fly the civilian route structures intermingled with commercial and general
aviation aircraft. 

12.3  CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITIES, AGENCIES, AND ORGANIZATIONS

12.3.1  Regulatory Authorities

The responsibility for establishing regulations and certifying the use of GPS in civil
airspace  is  shared  by  the  regulatory  agencies  of  individual  nations  as  well  as
cooperative  efforts  promoted  by  several  multinational  organizations.    The  primary
regulatory  agencies  are  the  CAAs  established  by  individual  nations  to  regulate
aviation within their own sovereign airspace.  They have the ultimate authority and
responsibility to manage air traffic and regulate aviation equipment, operations, and
aircrews.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a cooperative multinational
organization  that  is  the  primary  forum  for  establishment  of  Standards  and
Recommended Practices (SARPS) regarding international flights.  ICAO is also the
primary  forum  for  international  agreements  to  provide  common  standardized
navigation  and  communication  systems  or  address  similar  issues  which  ensure
interoperability  of  systems,  cooperation  between  nations,  and  generally  promote
flight  safety  and  efficiency.    The  multinational  agreements  are  supplemented  by
individual agreements between nations which can address such issues as joint use
of  both  nations'  airspace  and  mutual  recognition  of  aircraft  and  aircrew
certifications.

The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) is a
multinational organization founded to promote flight safety in Europe.  This region 
of  the  world  has  a  particularly  high  density  of  international  air  traffic  and  close
proximity  of  international  borders,  requiring  a  high  level  of  cooperation  between
nations.  Beyond air traffic management issues, EUROCONTROL has also become
a focus for technical advancement of aviation systems in general.

12.3.2  Advisory Groups

There are two primary advisory groups charged with developing and recommending
standards for the use of avionics systems in general and GPS/GNSS in particular. 
In  the  U.S.,  the  Radio  Technical  Commission  for  Aeronautics  (RTCA)  has
developed  (and  is  continuing  to  develop)  performance  standards  for  airborne
GPS/GNSS  equipment.    These  standards  have  subsequently  been  incorporated
into certification requirements by the U.S. CAA (the FAA).  In Europe, the European
Organization  for  Civil  Aviation  Electronics  (EUROCAE)  is  performing  a  similar
function 
two
organizations  has  been  maintained  to  ensure  the  viability  of  future  international
standards.  Both organizations are voluntary and composed of representatives from
government, industry, users, user groups, and related private organizations to allow
broad participation in the standardi zation process.

12.3.4  Civil Aviation Coordination With the U.S. and U.S. DoD

Civil  aviation  activities  and  concerns  are  coordinated  with  the  U.S.  and  U.S.  DoD
on  several  levels.    At  the  international  level,  the  U.S.  is  an  active  participant  in
ICAO  in  the  development  of  international  standards  and  policies  and  has  offered
GPS  as  a  major  component  of  the  GNSS.    Bilateral  agreements  have  also  been
established between the U.S. and various nations to promote cooperation between
the U.S. FAA and the various CAAs with respect to a variety of technical and policy
issues.  At the U.S. policy level, the U.S. DoT and U.S. DoD have jointly developed
a  Federal  Radionavigation  Plan  (FRP)  which  serves  as  the  planning  and  policy
statement for all U.S. Government radio navigation systems.  The FRP is updated
every  two  years  based  on  a  review  by  DoT  and  DoD  representatives  and  direct
input  from  the  public  obtained  through  a  series  of  radio  navigation  users'
conferences.  At the developmental level, the DoT is a direct participant in  the GPS
JPO and maintains a Deputy Program Director to represent civilian interests.  At  the
operational  level,  the  Civil  GPS  Service  Steering  Committee  and  the  U.S.  Coast
Guard, via the GPS Information Center, distribute GPS operational information and
coordinate civilian user concerns with the U.S. DoD U.S. Space Command and the
GPS Control Segment.

12.4  PRIMARY CIVIL AVIATION CONCERNS WITH GPS

The  primary  civil  aviation  concerns  with  GPS  are  availability,  accuracy,  integrity,
and  liability.    As  mentioned  above,  a  GPS  signal  loss  or  severe  accuracy
degradation  can  affect  large  areas  and  large  numbers  of  aircraft  simultaneously. 
For  this  reason  civil  aviation  organizations  have  been  strong  advocates  for
maximizing  the  number  of  active  GPS  satellites  in  order  to  minimize  the  effect  of
losing any particular satellite signal, supplementing GPS with the other components
of the GNSS, and providing an independent monitoring and warning system.

Integrity  is  defined  in  most  references  as  the  ability  of  a  system  to  provide  timely
warnings  to  users  when  the  system  should  not  be  used  for  navigation.    From  an
operational  point  of  view,  the  primary  purpose  of  an  integrity  function  is  to  detect
navaid  signal  failures  that  would  otherwise  result  in  hazardously  misleading
navigation  information  (HMI)  being  displayed  to  a  pilot  or  transmitted  to  an
autopilot.    Existing  ground-based  radio-navigation  aids  continuously  monitor  their
output  signals  and  typically  shut  down  when  a  significant  error  is  detected. 
Although the Control Segment and each satellite monitors GPS signal performance,
the  response  time  and  fault  monitoring  has  not  been  proved  sufficient  for  civil
aviation purposes.  In addition, for SPS users, the accuracy degradation due to SA
can occasionally result in position errors that are significant to some aviation uses,
such  as  nonprecision  approach.    For  these  reasons  an  additional  system  or
technique is required to assure GPS integrity.

12.4.1  Integrity Requirements

  Consequently, 

instrument 

the  primary  means  of  navigation  under 

Integrity requirements for aviation are based on the general requirement to maintain
safe  navigation  and  avoid  hazardous  situations. 
integrity
requirements  can  be  different  for  equipment  with  different  purposes  and  can  vary
with phase of flight as the proximity to potential hazards changes.  The key integrity
parameters  are  the  acceptable  probability  of  a  hazardous  event,  the  navigation
accuracy  threshold  that  defines  a  hazard,  and  the  allowed  time  delay  before  a
warning  must  be  issued.    Requirements  are  most  stringent  when  GPS  is  intended
as 
flight  rules  (IFR). 
Requirements  are  correspondingly  less  stringent  when  GPS  is  intended  as  a
supplementary aid to IFR flight, or a supplementary aid to visual flight rules (VFR)
flight.    In  all  cases,  requirements  also  change  based  on  the  phase  of  flight. 
Requirements are most stringent when GPS is used for approach and landing, and
correspondingly  less  stringent  for  terminal  area  and  enroute  flight,  depending
primarily  on  the  dimensions  of  individual  air  traffic  routes  and/or  aircraft  spacing
requirements.  The allocation of integrity requirements to GPS can also vary if GPS
is used in a hybrid system that performs automatic switching and/or cross-checking
between different navigation sources.  The following table shows an example of the
ranges  of  integrity  parameters.    However,  the  promulgation  of  actual  figures  shall
be given by ICAO.

It should be noted, that when integrity is a prime consideration, estimates of system
accuracy  and  availability  become  dependent  on  the  integrity  methodology.    The
accuracy of a system becomes dependent on the accuracy estimate developed by
the  integrity  methodology  and  used  to  compare  against  the  accuracy  threshold
requirement.    If  the  accuracy  estimate  is  conservative,  there  will  be  a  consequent
loss of availability, since the system will be given less credit for accuracy than truly
exists,  and  the  comparisons  against  the  accuracy  thresholds  will  fail  more  often. 
Similarly, if additional measurements are required to make an integrity decision, the
availability of the integrity decision can be significantly less than the availability of a
navigation  solution.    In  addition,  to  maximize  availability  and  minimize  prolonged
periods of unavailability, if a faulty measurement is detected that affects integrity, it
should then be excluded from the position solution, so that navigation can continue
whenever possible using the remaining valid measurements.

12.4.2  Required Navigation Performance

As  of  this  writing,  there  is  a  significant  change  beginning  in  the  way  navigation
systems  will  be  approved  in  the  future.    Historically,  approvals  to  operate  in  a
particular  airspace  or  on  a  particular  route  or  approach  have  been  based  on
requirements  to  carry  and  operate  specific  types  of  equipment.    The  Required
Navigation  Performance  (RNP)  concept  is  to  define  navigation  performance
requirements for airspace, routes, or approaches and let the user demonstrate that
equipment is provided aboard the aircraft that meets the applicable requirements. 
This is sometimes described as a "tunnel" concept, that is, RNP for a route would
be  defined  in  terms  of  an  inner  tunnel  defined  around  the  route  centerline
consisting of a 95% accuracy standard and an outer tunnel consisting of a 99.99%
or  higher  accuracy  standard.    The  outer  tunnel  is  sometimes  described  as  the
"containment"  tunnel,  because  that  is  a  threshold  beyond  which  a  hazard  is
assumed to exist, typically described as a collision risk with another aircraft or the
ground.
The parameters being considered to define RNP are accuracy, integrity, continuity,
and availability.  Continuity is defined as the probability that the navigation
accuracy within a containment threshold will continue to be provided once an

12-5

operation has begun.  It is possible that integrity and continuity may have different
levels of acceptable risk.  In general, integrity faults are not obvious to the flight
crew and do not give an opportunity to mitigate the situation.  In contrast, loss of
the navigation function is usually obvious to the flight crew, causing a heightened
awareness and an opportunity to resort to alternate procedures.  It is likely that the
availability parameter will apply to the signals provided by the navaid infrastructure
rather than the airborne equipment.  It is assumed that the aircraft will not be
dispatched unless the proper navigation equipment is available.  Once the aircraft
is airborne, the continuity requirement supersedes any availability requirement for
the navigation equipment since the availability concept assumes the possibility of
repair, which is generally not feasible in flight.

12.4.3  Integrity Assurance

The  two  primary  approaches  to  assuring  GPS  integrity  are  autonomous  integrity
monitoring  (AIM)  and  broadcast  integrity  messages  (BIM).    AIM,  as  the  name
implies,  consists  of  analyses  that  the  receiver  or  navigation  system  can  perform
autonomously or in conjunction with existing on-board navigation aids.  Algorithms
executed  by  the  receiver  are  often  called  RAIM  (Receiver  AIM)  and  algorithms
executed  elsewhere  in  the  aircraft  are  often  called  AAIM  (Aircraft  AIM).    In  the
general  sense,  a  Kalman  filter  is  a  form  of  AIM  since  it  can  detect  and  neglect
certain types of anomalous measurements, however, it can fail to detect slow drift-
type integrity failures.  One common AIM technique relies on the principle that the
receiver can in most cases detect and isolate a satellite signal failure that impacts
integrity, if it has an overdetermined position solution.  For example, if five satellite
signals are available, five position solutions can be obtained using combinations of
four  satellites.  In the  event  of  a  large  pseudorange  error  in  one  satellite,  the  four
solutions based on the faulty satellite will be similar to each other and significantly
different from the fifth.  In this case, the error can be easily detected and isolated. 
Much  attention  has  been  given  to  this  subject  by  various  researchers  to  evaluate
and enhance the effectiveness of this technique. Similar techniques can be used to
detect integrity failures using other sources of range or position information.  Many
of  these  techniques  have  been  discussed  in  open  literature,  particularly  in  the
papers of the various technical societies associated with navigation as well as the
RTCA and EUROCAE.

the 

The focus of recent AIM research has been primarily to enhance the availability of
the integrity decision and enhance the probability of continuing with navigation after
a fault has been detected.  The primary methods of improving the availability of the
integrity  decision  are  to  incorporate  measurements  from  additional  navigation
sensors  or 
to  obtain  more  satellite
measurements.    The  primary  methods  of  improving  the  probability  of  navigation

is
broadcasting a faulty signal in order to remove it from the navigation solution. Fault
exclusion  is  a  slightly  different  technique  which  requires  only  that  an  offending
satellite  be  excluded  from  the  navigation  solution  when  it  is  difficult  to  determine
which  of  several  satellites  is  faulty.    Partial  identification  is  a  hybrid  of  the  two

previous techniques which takes advantage of the strengths of both and appears to
greatly improve the probability of continuing successful navigation.
BIM  can  take  several  forms,  but  is  closely  related  to  differential  GPS/GNSS.    In
general,  any  system  that  provides  differential  GPS  or  GNSS  corrections  also
provides  BIM  if  it  provides  an  assessment  or  guarantee  of  residual  range  errors
after the differential corrections are applied to the receiver range measurements. 
The  receiver  can  then  estimate  the  residual  position  error  using  the  observed
satellite geometry and compare it against the current integrity alarm threshold.  The
BIM system can also make the integrity decision and issue use/don't-use messages
for  individual  satellites,  but  there  can  be  a  significant  increase  in  the  false  alarm
rate  for  many  users  since  the  BIM  system  must  make  a  conservative  assumption
regarding  the  user's  satellite  geometry  and  number  of  satellites  in  the  user's
position  solution.    Use/don't-use  messages  can  still  be  valuable  to  indicate
satellites that are not monitored or that are exhibiting extremely erroneous or erratic
behavior.

terrestrial  networks  of  differential  GPS/GNSS 

BIM  functions  can  be  incorporated  in  either  a  local-area  or  wide-area  differential
system. The U.S., European nations, Japan, and Australia are currently planning or
developing 
receivers  with
differential/integrity  broadcasts  via  geo stationary  communication  satellites.    It  is
planned that the satellites will broadcast the messages superimposed on a ranging
signal that emulates actual GPS ranging signals.  These additional ranging signals
will  significantly  enhance  the  availability  of  the  SPS  position  solution  in  the
coverage areas of the satellites.  It is also likely that differential/integrity data may
be broadcast by terrestrial stations in northern regions where geostationary satellite
signals  are  intermittent  or  subject  to  obscuration.    The  U.S.  and  Canada  are
planning  to  have  a  cooperative  wide-area  system  operating  by  1998,  and  the
European Community and Japan by the year 2000. 

AIM and BIM can be supportive of each other, and may be used in combination to
meet  the most  stringent  integrity  requirements.    In  addition,  the  U.S.  DoD  is
implementing  upgrades  to  the  Control  Segment  monitoring  and  failure  response
time, to minimize the problem at the signal source.  One such solution (nicknamed
"satzap") involves commanding the satellite to change its PRN number to one that
is unused, in the event a specific URE threshold is exceeded.  The threshold would
be  chosen  to  protect  non-precision  approaches,  which  is  the  most  restrictive
integrity requirement for non-differential GPS.  The unused PRN number would be
permanently  set  unhealthy  in  the  satellite  almanacs  so  a  properly  operating
receiver  would  never  try  to  acquire  it.    Immediately  after  an  upload,  the  failure
response time would be extremely short since the ground antenna would already be
in contact with the satellite.  The technique would also be effective against slowly
increasing  errors  (e.g.,  clock  drift  failures)  since  the  satellite  could  be  contacted
and  "zapped"  before  the  error  exceeded  the  URE  threshold.    Swiftly  increasing
errors  and  large  step  errors  will  normally  cause  a  user  receiver  to  lose  lock. 
Fortunately, these types of errors can be easily detected by AIM, or a Kalman filter,
in  cases  where  a  user  receiver  might  acquire  or  reacquire  the  satellite  before  the
control segment can correct or neutralize the problem.

CHAPTER 13:  DIGITAL MAPS

13.1  INTRODUCTION

Maps serve a dual purpose for military use:  for navigation and for tactical displays.
 Maps have traditionally been made from paper for navigation.  Early digital maps
could only show a subset of the data available on paper maps, such as roads.  The
maps  and  display  units  could  not  provide  topographical,  thematic  or  other
information.    Today,  digital  maps  for  navigation  and  tactical  displays  have  been
developed  showing  all  the  map  information,  that  only  paper  maps  could  show
previously.    This  chapter  discusses  digital  maps  and  tactical  displays,  particularly
with their relevance to GPS.  Modern digital mapping and/or geographic information
systems  can  easily  relate  data  if  the  data  has  been  geographically  coded.    Tools
can  be  provided  to  locate  all  data  points  of  a  particular  type  within  a  particular
region, calculate areas, distances, etc.  ZOOM and SCROLL features can be used
to  more  closely  examine  areas  of  interest,  or  eliminate  extraneous  information. 
Different types of data can be allocated to a unique layer, which can then be added
or  removed  from  the  display  as  desired.    Additional  tools  can  be  provided  which
make  it  easy  to  convert  distances  and  measurement  units  from  one  format  to
another. 

13.2  WHAT IS A DIGITAL MAP?

There are basically three types of digital maps today:

a. "Digitized" paper maps
b.  Digital database maps
c.  Hybrids

These  maps  are  distributed  in  a  variety  of  logical  and  physical  formats.    Physical
formats  include  cartridges,  CD-ROM,  tape,  and  floppy  disk.    Logical  data  formats
vary depending on the manufacturer.  When selecting a digital map, be certain that
the format is compatible with the software product that will be using the data.

13.2.1  Digitized Paper Maps

Digitized  paper  maps  are  not  digital  maps  in  the  true  sense.    The  digitized  paper
map is made by using an optical reader to "read" the infor mation from a paper map,
digitize  it  and  store  it  in  a  database  and  then  project  the  digitized  paper  map
information on a video screen.   There are two basic methods for storage of digitized
paper map information:  it can either be stored as vector informa tion,  or  as  raster
information.  The vector method is to define every point of a contour that shall be
displayed on the map as a point on the end of a vector.  Each vector will originate
from a selected point on a map.  The com puter will "fill in" the open areas inside the
contours with different colors depending on whether the contours are land masses,
a navigation buoy, etc.  This method requires the least data storage.  In the raster
storage  method,  an  optional  scanner  scans  the  map  and  stores  every  bit  of
information  from  the  paper  map,  including  the  "fill  in"  for  contours.    This  method

13-1

requires  a  much  larger  memory  for  map  data  storage  than  the  vector  method. 
These maps are no more accurate than the paper map, but are adequate for many
applications.

13.2.2  Digital Database Maps

Digital database maps are maps presenting position data from a data base where all
the  position  coordinates  are  collected  through  survey ing  operations.    This
information  is  therefore  much  more  accurate  and  contains  3 -D  position  data  for
every  point  on  the  map.  Variations  of  this  type  of  map  are  now  available  from
various  sources.    Digital  maps  are  often  combined  as  overlays  to  digitized  paper
maps  to  provide  a  more  accurate  location  of  specific  features  such  as  roads,
buildings, etc.

13.2.3  HYBRID Maps

Hybrid maps are combinations of digitized paper maps and digital database maps. 
Positioning coordinates that have been collected through surveying operations are
used  to  'adjust'  the  coordinates  on  the  paper  map.    Distances  between  these
benchmark  points  can  then  extrapolated  by  the  display  device.    By  using  this
technique, the digitized paper map can provide more accurate position information
than  the  map  it  was  prepared  from,  but  it  will  still  not  provide  the  accuracy  of  a
digital  database  map.    The  accuracy  of  these  maps  depends  on  the  number  and
accuracy of the benchmarks employed, the accuracy with which they are combined
with  benchmark  features  on  the  digitized  paper  maps,  and  the  accuracy  of  the
extrapolation algorithms.

13.3  NAVIGATION MAPS AND TACTICAL MAPS

Maps  normally  serve  two  functions  on  board  a  military  vehicle:  they  are  used  for
navigation of the vehicle, and to give a visual display to the vehicle's commander of
where  enemy,  friendly,  and  neutral  forces  are  located.    It  also  contains  a
geographical  presentation  of  any  other  information  of  importance  to  the  vehicle
operators.

13.3.1  Use of Digital Maps for Navigation

Traditionally,  navigation  sensors  (LORAN-C,  TRANSIT,  TACAN,  DECCA,  optical
bearing,  radar,  etc.)  have  been  used  to  determine  position  in  latitude/longitude  or
bearing  and  distance  from  an  object.    The  infor mation  was  then  transferred  to  a
paper  map  to  provide  the  navigator  with  infor mation  about  his  actual  position
relative  to  desired  position.    This  information  was  then  used  by  the  navigator  to
decide the necessary course of action to get back to his desired track.  For many
military vehicles operating at high speed in confined waters/airspace during tactical
engagements  (radio  communications,  weapon  delivery,  etc.)  positioning  of  the
vehicle is a too time consuming process using traditional methods. Digital  database
maps with position and course/speed over the ground provided on the map by GPS
are  now  being  employed  to  provide  the  navigator/pilot  with  much  more  time  to
concentrate  on  other  tasks  without  jeopardizing  the  vehicle's  safety.  GPS -derived

13-2

latitude/longitude information presented on a CDU is too accurate to be utilized for
positioning  of  the  vehicle  on  a  paper  map  using  a  pencil.    The  accura cy  of  the
pencil  mark  (1 mm)  on  the  map  is  only  accurate  to  50  m  on  a  l:50000  map. 
Additionally, most of the navigator's problems are not related to the determination
of  the  vehicle's  absolute  position,  which  is  what  the  GPS  CDU  presents,  but  its
position relative to obstacles, other vehicles, desired weapon release points, etc.

Only under en-route navigation is the navigator interested in his absolute position
when navigating to pre-planned waypoints and/or rendezvous positions.  The GPS
derived position data must there fore be transferred to some kind of map to tell the
operator  where  he  is  and  where  he  wants  to  go.    Position  information  from  GPS
displayed on a digital map can be verified by super imposing a radar picture on the
digital  map  display  or  by  presenting  position  information  from  other  navigation
systems on the digital map.

13.3.2  Use of Digital Maps for Tactical Displays

Tactical  displays  are  often  video  screens  or  other  displays  which  present  a
synthetic picture of target position and target course/speed obtained from external
sources or onboard systems (electro-optical systems, lasers etc.).  A radar picture
can  also  be  displayed  on  the  same  screen  to  provide  a  correlation  between  the
radar picture and the synthetic picture.  There are times when the radar may not be
transmitting, 
(EMCON)  policies  are
implemented.  During these times, compensation for HV movement is provided by
an  onboard  navigation  system  such  as  an 
  Under
such circumstances a digital map display has two limitations:

for  example,  when  Emission  Control 

INS  or  gyro/log. 

a. The  synthetic  picture  "drifts"  due  to  INS  drift  or  inaccuracy  in  gyro/log

information, if radar updates are not possible.

b. Only  limited  map  information  is  available  on  the  tactical  display.    Paper
maps  may  have  to  be  used  to  give  a  complete  picture  of  the  tactical
situation.

These  limitations  can  be  eliminated  by  using  digital  maps  updated  by  GPS.    The
tactical  display  picture  then  has  no  drift  problem  because  it  is  constantly  updated
by  GPS,  where  all  map  information  including  own  position,  course  and  speed  are
displayed  very  accurately.    In  additional  to  enhancing  the  performance  of  each
individual  platform,  substantial  improvements  in  multi -platform  coordination  are
possible due to aligned tactical displays of  the units.

13.3.3  Improvement of Common Reference Grids

The  continuous  availability  of  precise  GPS  position  and  velocity  on  participating
platforms can provide numerous enhanced force coordina tion capabilities including:

a.
Improved gridlock
b. Geodetic gridlock
c. Sensor calibration
d. Over The Horizon Targeting (OTHT) operations

13-3

13.3.3.1  Improved Gridlock

Gridlock  alignment  is  often  based  on  radar,  LASER  rangefinder  or  other  sensor
observations where bearing and range from a grid reference unit is transformed in
grid coordinates of the force.  This inter -platform alignment technique can introduce
substantial  errors  in  positioning  if  sensors  are  not  correctly  aligned.    By
incorporating  a  GPS  receiver  into  the  sensor,  the  inter-platform  alignment  can  be
greatly improved.

13.3.3.2  Geodetic Gridlock

Present  gridlock  algorithms  provide  a  relative  grid  bringing  partici pating  units  into
relative  alignment  with  respect  to  a  common  track,  without  regard  to  geodetic
(absolute)  position  or  orientation  accuracy  of  the  entire  grid.    While  this  serves
current purposes well, advanced tactics and systems will require accurate geodetic
as well as relative alignment of the grid. For instance:

a. Better  incorporation  of  intelligence  information  (e.g.  from  other  sensors/
subsurface,  surface,  air  and  space)  using  GPS  as  a  common  position
reference system

b.

Initialization of Long Range Sea/Land attack weapons

c. Maintenance  of  gridlock  under  EMCON  conditions  is  a  must  for  modern
anti-air  warfare  systems  where  units  are  coordinated  in  fully  automated
way to respond to incoming threats.

13.3.3.3  Sensor Calibration

Improved  alignment  of  search  and  fire  control  radar  sensors  and  anti -submarine
warfare sonar sensors by using GPS results in a more accurate weapon delivery.

13.3.3.4  OTHT Operations

In the OTHT arena, extended OTHT threat ranges have increased the necessity to
hand off target track data to participating combatants at longer ranges which  may
not  be  gridlocked  with  the  local  tactical  grid.    Furthermore,  many  of  the  current
OTHT  exercises  are  conducted  during  radar  EMCON  where  grid  lock  updates
cannot be performed. Experience with Harpoon missile OTHT exercises has shown
that significant relative navigation errors can occur under these circumstances and
can  lead  to  false  target  acquisitions  and  engage ments  between  friendly  forces. 
With  GPS-  equipped  combatants,  such  problems  can  be  eliminated  and  OTHT
tactics  can 
intercept  capability  of  modern
surface-to-surface missiles.  Use of digital maps, GPS and synthetic information on
the tactical display gives the operator a complete picture of:

fully  exploit 

the 

long -range 

a. Own position/course/speed over ground (from GPS)
b. Accurate target position/course/speed

13-4

c. Friendly forces' position/course/speed
d. Geographical obstacles in possible weapon trajectories
e. Other  information  vital  to  the  operator  (safety  zones,  waypoints,  weapon

engagement zones, etc.).

13.4  OTHER ISSUES CONCERNING DIGITAL MAPS AND GPS

The  use  of  digital  maps  and  GPS  raises  at  least  three  questions/prob lems  to  be
aware of:

a. Electrical interfaces between GPS receiver and digital map systems
b. Digital map accuracy
c. Map datums

13.4.1  Electrical Interface Between the Digital Map Display and the GPS

 Receiver

Most  of  the  available  GPS  receivers  provide  an  external  interface  capability  that
can be used to integrate the receiver with a digital map system.  These interfaces
generally conform to the NMEA 0183 format.  Differential receivers will also provide
 an  RTCM  SC-104  message.    These  inter faces  may  be  usable  to  transfer  GPS
position,  speed  over  ground,  heading,  etc.  to  the  digital  map.    If  you  wish  to
integrate GPS with a digital map system, make sure that one or more of the GPS
receiver  interfaces  are  compatible  with  an  interface  on  the  digital  map  system  in
terms of:

a. Electrical characteristics
b. Functional characteristics
c. Data format
d. Data update rates

13.4.2  Digital Maps Accuracy

Digital  maps  that  are  produced  by  the  raster-scan  process  from  ordinary  paper
maps  cannot  be  more  accurate  than  the  source  documents  from  which  they  are
prepared.  Some  of  the  paper  maps  used  for  navigation  today  are  based  on
surveying data that is 80 to 100 years old. The quality of these maps leaves much
to be desired when used for today's navigational needs.  Additionally, inaccuracies
in the optical reader system and operator -induced inaccuracies can produce errors
which when combined are less accurate than the original paper map. It is therefore,
very important to display the "age of the mapping data" on the digital map display to
alert the navigator to the mapping inaccuracy.

13.4.3  Map Datums

The GPS receiver employs ECEF coordinates which are based on the WGS-84 map
datum.  Most  receivers  and  digital  mapping  systems  have  the  capability  to  convert
from the WGS-84 datum to any one of a number of user-selected datums.  When a

13-5

GPS receiver is integrated with a digital map it is important to ensure that the GPS
receiver and the digital mapping system are configured for the same datum.  If not,
the navigation accuracy of the total system will be severely degraded.

ANNEX A:  GLONASS: RUSSIAN'S
EQUIVALENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM

This complete article was provided by

Mr. John Owen in 1995

and reflects the GLONASS situation at that date

A.1   HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Similarly to the US TRANSIT, Russia operates CICADA, since the 1970's, the system
consists of dual frequency VHF signals (150 MHz and 400 MHz) from satellites in near
polar, low earth orbit. As the US has built up the Navstar GPS to replace TRANSIT, the
Russians  have  developed  an  equivalent  system,  the  Global  Navigation  Satellite
Service,  GLONASS.    GLONASS  uses  a  similar  architecture  to  GPS  for  most
components of its system users navigate with GLONASS in the same manner as GPS. 
The system saw its origins in the mid 1970s at the Scientific Production Association of
Applied  Mechanics  (NPO  PM)  a  developer  of  military  satellite  in  Kransnoyarsk-26.
Since 1982 a range of GLONASS satellites have been  launched three at a time, from
the Tyuratam space centre.  Although there was some doubt concerning the Russians
intentions  in  the  early  1990's,  however  several  statements  concerning  the  systems
future  particularly  to  ICAO,  and  launches  during  1994  and  1995  have  confirmed
GLONASS will reach full operation by late 1995.

GLONASS is owned and operated by Military Space Forces of the Russian Ministry of
Defence.  The  Russian  Institute  of  Radio  Navigation  and  Time  in  St  Petersburg
designed and supports the synchronization of master clock systems, maintains satellite
and Earth based time and frequency standards and develops receivers. 

A.2   PURPOSE OF GLOBAL SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS

for  world  wide  continuous  use. 

GLONASS  as  Navstar  GPS  provides  precision  position  fixing  and  time  reference
systems 
time-of-arrival
measurements  simultaneously  to  four  satellites  and  by  using  the  received  data  to
compute  the  position  of  the  satellites  solves  the  four  range  equations  for  his  three
unknown position coordinates and time. 

  An  observer  makes 

It is presumed the primary purpose of GLONASS is similarly to GPS for weapon system
navigation and guidance.  However as with GPS the wide interest in the use of satellite
navigation systems has resulted in parts of the system being offered for international
civil use.

A.3   SYSTEM ACCURACY

GLONASS produces both high accuracy signals specified as being for Russian military
use only and a lesser accuracy signal for civilian use.  The high accuracy channel is
provide with an anti-spoofing capability Ref 1, that is controlled by the Russian Ministry
of Defence.  However, there is no equivalent of the selective availability deployed on
GPS and currently  the anti spoofing mode is not active, Ref 2.

Tests,  Ref  2  of  the  GLONASS  civil  system  have  demonstrated  accuracies  of  30  m
horizontally and 20 m in altitude and 0.05 m/s in velocity.  However the specifications
provided  to  the  ITU,  Ref  3  for  GLONASS  state  a  position  accuracy  of  100  m  and  a
velocity  accuracy  of  0.15  m/s.  Ref 1  refers  to  a  horizontal  accuracy  of  100  m  and  a
vertical accuracy of 150 m.  A full GLONASS constellation provides a 94.7% probability
of  achieving  the  above  accuracies  worldwide.    User  derived  time  is  within  1  ms  of
system  reference  time.    Ephemeris  accuracy  to  UTC  is  designed  to  be  5  ms.    The
Russians have classified the military accuracy of the system.

A.4   MONITOR AND CONTROL SUBSYSTEM

As for GPS, GLONASS is controlled and monitored by a complex ground system.  Data
defining  satellite  position,    system  time  and  navigation  message  is  uploaded  to  the
satellites every 24 hrs with the satellite timing synchronized on every orbit, Ref 3 . 

The GLONASS monitor and control segment consists of:

- Ground control centre (GCC) Moscow
- Central synchronizer (CS) Moscow
- TT&C stations Saint Petersburg, Yeniseisk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur
- navigation signal phase control system (PCS) Moscow
- quantum-optical station (QOS), Komsomolsk-on-Amur
- navigation field control equipment (NFCE) Moscow,Komsomolsk-on-Amur

The monitoring and control subsystem operate autonomously and receives the data of
Earth  rotation  parameters,  corrections  to  the  system  time  relative  to  Russian  Time  &
Frequency Standard (UTC SU) externally. 

A-2

Satellite ephemeris is generated by observation of the ranging signals by the NFCE. 
However, GLONASS satellite also have a laser reflector that enables an independent
measurement of range and orbit parameters. 

A.5   SPACE SEGMENT

Satellite orbital position and the overall numbers in orbit are driven by the requirements
for accuracy and availability.  The constellation is made up of 24 satellites located in
three orbit planes of eight satellites.  The planes are spaced at 120 degree intervals
around the equator and inclined at 64.8 degrees.  (The longitude of the point where the
satellite crosses the equation in a northerly directions is known as the Right Ascension
of the Ascending Node, RAAN).  The satellites are equally spaced in the orbit plane in
circular  orbits,  maximum  eccentricity  0.01,  with  a  period  around  11  hrs  15  mins  at  a
height of 19100 kms.  (These parameters are very near that planed originally for GPS
before the 6 plane constellation was introduced). 

It is reported Ref 1, that the constellation will be populated by filling pre-defined orbital
"slots". Thus while the GLONASS system is being completed and when older satellites
reach  the  end  of  their  life,  gaps  will  appear  in  the  constellation.    Based  on  the
performance  of  all  24  satellite  GLONASS  controllers  will  determine  the  'best'  21  to
activate.  The remaining three will be held back in reserve.  Periodically the mix will be
evaluated and if necessary a new best set of 21 defined.  When necessary to maintain
system accuracy three new satellite will be launched. 

Taking plane 1 with an RAAN of 128 degrees on day 240, 1995 as reference, planes 2
and 3 have RAAN's of +120 and +240 degrees respectively as illustrated in Figure A-1.
 Separation  in the argument of latitude or orbital phase in the plane is a multiple of 45
degrees.    There  is  a  displacement  of  +30  degrees  and  -30  degrees  for  satellites  in
planes  2  and  3  respectively  with  reference  to  plane  1.    Phase  angle  is  measured
clockwise with the satellite direction of travel being anti-clockwise.  Relative positions of
satellites  appear  to  remain  stable  over  long  periods.  The  rate  of  change  of  RAAN  is
approximately -0.03 degrees/day, resulting in the RAAN of plane 1 changing from 167
degrees  in 1989 to 128 degrees in 1995. 

All satellites have the same nominal orbital period of 11 hrs 25 mins.  The orbit period
is  equivalent  to  a  movement  of  675.73  degrees  of  longitude,  a  change  of  169.41
degrees W each orbit.  The orbit produces a ground-track repeat every 17 orbits that is
8 days less 32.56 minutes.  This diurnal offset of DT = 4.07 minutes from a full 24-hour
day  coincides  with  that  of  Navstar  GPS  and  is  very  nearly  the  difference  between  a
solar and  sidereal day (3.93 minutes).  This implies that each complete day  less DT
minutes  a  satellite  performs  17/8  orbits  or  2  whole  revolutions  plus  an  additional  1/8
revolution,  equivalent  to  45  degrees.    Therefore  two  satellites  in  the  same  plane  but
separated  by  45  degrees  in  orbital  phase,  appear  at  precisely  the  same  position  on
successive days less DT minutes.  Over a ground track repeat interval of 8 days, all
satellites in the same plane with separation of 45 degrees appear in turn at the same
position at intervals of 1 day less DT minutes.  After 8 days, the whole cycle naturally
repeats.

A-3

Figure A-1.  GLONASS Orbit Planes and Slots

A-4

By examining the phases of satellites in the other planes 2 and 3, it becomes apparent
that these satellites will also appear at the same position as the reference satellite in
plane 1 within the same 8-day period.  This arises because the time taken by the  earth
to rotate through the angle 120 degrees separating planes 1 and 2 is the same time
taken by a satellite in that plane with phase +255 degrees to travel round to the same
position as the reference satellite.  The earth rotates through 120 degrees in 478.69
minutes,  very  nearly  8  hours,  which  corresponds  almost  exactly  to  17/24  of  a
GLONASS orbit or +255 degrees.  The same argument holds for plane 3 at 240 degree
separation for a satellite at phase +150 degrees (or twice +255 less 360 degrees).  The
 angular  separation  of  45  degrees  within  the  plane  together  with  the  angular  phase
differences of +/- 30 degrees between planes assures that in an 8 day period, all 24
satellites will pass through the position with the reference sub-satellite location.

The above argument holds for any valid pointing angle.  Once an antenna is pointed at
any satellite in the system, all others will in time pass through the main beam.  For any
location, the azimuth and elevation for a particular track have to be computed  over an
8-day period, following which suitable pointing angles and time may be chosen by the
observer for the reference orbit and satellite.  The entire subsequent orbital behavior is
synchronous  as  explained.    This  argument  has  assumed  a  near-perfect  circular  orbit
and precise orbital spacing and timing.

A.6   MANOEUVERING IN ORBIT

During recent years the Russians have moved several satellites within the orbital plane
to a new position.  This operation has occurred following a satellite failure or to position
a  particular  satellites  in  antipodal  positions  to  allow  broadcast  using  common
frequency.  Manoeuvres to change the phase of a satellite in orbit begin by firing of the
on-board thrusters at apogee where the velocity vector is at right angles to the radius
vector.    This  action  takes  the  spacecraft  into  an  orbit  with  altered  period  (slightly
eccentric) in such a way that the space-craft gradually falls behind or moves forward
(depending on the direction of thruster firing) from its initial position.  After an integer
number  of  orbits,  the  required  position  in  phase  is  reached  and  a  reverse  firing  of
thrusters of exactly the same magnitude as the first ensures a new stable and circular
orbit.  Taking the semi-major axis of the near-circular orbit as 'a' and the elliptical orbit
as 'a-Da', then the eccentricity of the new orbit is 'e = Da/(a-Da)'.  The change in orbital
period DT, referred to the period of the circular orbit, is found from Kepler's third law :

An example of such a manoeuvre is provide by Daly, Ref 2.  Cosmos 1885 was given a
velocity  change  on  21  September  1987  such  as  to  decrease  its  period  by  almost  8
minutes and then to carry out 21 orbits along the elliptical path, allowing the space-craft
to accomplish the 90-degree phase movement in 10 days.  It is clearly demonstrated
that  the  GLONASS  satellites  are  capable  of  rapid  manoeuvering  within  the  orbit. 
GLONASS spacecraft have  enough  fuel  on-board  to accomplish manoeuvres several
times: Cosmos 1779 traversed 45-degrees of arc on three separate occasions.  Clearly
spacecraft in the orbital arc which fail can quickly be replaced by another spacecraft. 
This flexibility would give GLONASS an advantage during the operational phase where
one  would  expect  in-orbit  spares  to  be  in  place  and  ready  to  cover  for  any
malfunctioning  units.

A different control philosophy appears to be used by the Russians to control GLONASS
satellite to the US control of GPS.  Whereas GPS satellites are precisely controlled to
follow the same ground track each day, GLONASS does not repeat unlit 17 days.  The
result  is  that  GPS  appears  to  have  a  large  number  of  control  manoeuvres  than
GLONASS  and  must  therefore  carry  more  fuel  and  have  a  more  complex  control
network. 

A.7   SPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION

GLONASS  spacecraft  similarly  to  Cicada,  have  significantly  shorter  lifetime  than  US
equivalents.  Lifetimes have increased over the programmes life, see below, from under
two years to currently approaching 5 years. 

The  Russians  have  announced  that  from  1995  a  modified  upgraded  satellite  will  be
deployed.  There  are  several  stages  planned  in  the  programme,  Ref  1.    The  current
GLONASS satellite has a mass of 1300 kg which will rise in 1995-8 to 1480 kg mostly
due  to  increased  fuel  load.    Minor  modifications  will  be  made  to  the  Proton  launch
system with a reduction to two satellites per launch.  Improvements will be made to the
attitude  control  systems,  clocks    and  ground  systems.    The  result  is  an  increase  in
navigation  accuracy    and  time.    In  addition  differential  corrections  with  respect  to
Universal  time  and  system  time  scales  of  GPS  and  GLONASS  are  planned  to  be
transmitted. 

The  second  stage  of  system  development  GLONASS-M  is  scheduled  for  deployment
after 2000.  (It is confusing that some Russian writers refer to the stage one upgrade as
GLONASS-M).    The  upgrade  will  include  autonomous  satellite  using  inter  satellite
measurements  to  solve  the  ephemeris  problem  and  improved  lifetime  for  the  solar
arrays.  Inter satellite measurements will be made in the optical and radio bands and
communications provided for navigation data exchanges.Autonomous operation for 60
days without degradation is specified.  The main error is caused by the extrapolation of

A-6

the earth's rotation  which are approximately 30 m/s RMS deviation in 60 days.  The
system is designed to produce users accuracies of 10 m, 0.01 m/s and 20 ns.   The
additional systems will increase the satellite weight to 2000 kgs. 

The  onboard  clock  is  the  most  critical  element  of  the  satellite.    GLONASS  clocks  of
have  seen  a  steady  improvement  in  frequency  and  temperature  stability  from  initially
5.10-11, to better than 1.10-13  with  operational  lifetimes  extending  from  5000  to  18000
hrs.  Future plans for GLONASS-M may include a Hydrogen Maser with a stability of
5.10-14.    Use  of  the  H-maser  is  predicted  to  increase  the  operational  accuracy  of  the
system by an order of magnitude.  An experiment is being conducted with Germany and
Switzerland scheduled for a launch in 1995. Further development are planned before
the H-maser are installed on GLONASS-M satellites in the 2000 + timeframe. 

A.8   SATELLITE LAUNCH PROGRAM

The  first  GLONASS  launch  was  announced  in  October  1982,  although  none  of  the
three satellites became operational.  GLONASS satellites are launched three at a time
into  the  same  orbit  plane  by  the  Proton  launch  vehicle.    Initially  successful  launches
were  announcement  within  a  day  or  two  in  Pravda,  but  recently  the  Russians  have
provided advanced  notice of launches which have proved accurate to within a week. 

By  June  1995  there  had  been  59  satellite  launched  with  currently  19  operational. 
Table A-1 presents the international identifiers, Cosmos numbers launch dates, end of
operational life dates, orbit position and frequency.  Initially all triple launches were into
orbital  planes  1  and  3,  but  in  August  1994  the  first  launch  was  made  into  plane  2. 
Russia has now stated that the complete 24 satellite system will be operational by he
end of 1996. 

Many  of  the  early  launches  produced  only  two  or  in  some  cases  one  operational
satellite.  The third satellite being a passive laser ranging target used to "...  produce
information for the increase in accuracy in the determination and prediction of motion of
cosmic    apparatus  (satellites)  ..."  (Pravda,  2  June  1989).    In  this  particular  edition  of
Pravda also, the word GLONASS appears for the first time.

It was also a normal feature of the system in the early stages for a launch to occur only
when  the  number  of  functioning  satellites  has  fallen  or  was  about  to  fall  below  the
number required  for adequate testing of the system.  This number cannot be stated 
with  absolute  precision  since  it  depends  on  the  orbital  planes  of    the  remaining
satellites.    However  a  reduction  of  available  units  to  any  number  less  than  four  was
likely to act as a precursor to  a new launch.

A.9   TRANSMISSION FREQUENCIES

The  carrier  frequency  chosen  to  transmit  the  L1  navigation  signal  are  in  the  ITU
assigned aeronautical satellite navigation band from 1559 MHz to 1620 MHz.  A dual
frequency system is used for the precise military signal with a second L2 transmission
in the 1250 MHz band.  Dual frequency navigation messages at L1 and L2 allow the
user  to  correct  for  ionospheric  propagation  effects  and  are  incorporated  into  both
NAVSTAR and GLONASS. 

Unlike GPS GLONASS uses a different frequency for each satellite.  Radio frequency
carriers  used  by  GLONASS  are  channelized  within  the  bands  1240-1260  MHz  and
1597-1617  MHz,  the  channel  spacing  being  7/16  or  0.4375  MHz  at  L2  and  9/16  or
0.5625 MHz at L1.  The carrier frequencies are multiples of channel spacing.  Currently
the number of planned channels is 24 but the Russians have given notice, Ref 4, that
this  is  scheduled  to  change  in  the  late  1990's  to  12  with  anti  podal  satellites
transmitting at the same frequency, see Fig A-1.

The frequency is defined from the following expressions.

L1(f) = 1602.2+0.5625KMHz

L2(f) = 1246.0+0.4375KMHz

where:

K =  0,1,2.......24  the carrier number

K = 0 is reserved for test purposes and is not used operationally.

All frequencies in each of the L1 and L2 bands are coherent and formed by the same
frequency standard.  The ratio of frequencies (K2/K1) emitted by a satellite in L1 and
L2  is  7/9.    The  frequency  used  by  particular  satellites  is  transmitted  in  the  almanac
transmitted by each satellite in the constellation.  Initially all GLONASS satellites used
a separate frequency.  However, since 1992 the Russians have begun to use common
frequencies for anti-podal satellites.

Following  the  World  Administrative  Radio  Conference  in  1992  the  Russians  have
announced  their  intention  to  move  the  GLONASS  frequency  Band.    At  WARC-92
coprimary  allocations  were  given  for  Radioastronomy,  1610  to  1613  MHz  and  for
Mobile Satellite Systems (ground to satellite) 1610 to 1620 MHz.  From 1998 to 2005
the Russians have stated GLONASS will use the frequency band 1598.0625 MHz  (K=-
7) to 1609.3125 MHz (K=13) for L1 and the equivalent frequencies 1242.9375 MHz to
1251.6875 MHz for L2.  After 2005 GLONASS will use frequency channels K= -7 to K=
+4 with channels 5 and 6 used for technical operations (K (6) = 1605.3750 MHz L1 and
1248.6250 L2).

A-10

A.10   TRANSMISSION POWERS AND PROTECTION RATIO

The power radiated by each satellite is defined in Table B-2 for various angles from the
boresight of the transmitting antenna.  The power flux density at the earth's surface for
satellites at greater than 5 degrees elevation submitted to the ITU, Ref 4 are as follows:

-152 dBW/m2 per 4 KHz - for C/A-code signals in L1 band

-162 dBW/m2 per 4 KHz - for P-code signals in L1 band

-168 dBW/m2 per 4 KHz - for P-code signals in L2 band

The power output from a 0 dBic antenna is specified as :

-160 dBW for C/A and P-code L1. 

-166 dBW for P-code L2.

However,  measurements  of  the  signal  strength  suggest  that  the  L1  GLONASS  C/A
code is 2 to 3 dB stronger than GPS.  The Russians have defined a protection ratio
(wanted signal power to maximum tolerable interference) for the GLONASS signals as:

-15 dB for C/A code in L1 band

-25 dB for P-code L1 and L2 bands.

GLONASS  specify  that  a  satellite  in  an  adjacent  frequency  allocation  shall  not  create
interference above -48 dB if visible.

A.11   INFORMATION TRANSMISSION, BANDWIDTH AND CODE RATES

Each  satellite  transmits  a  navigation  signal  in  the  L1  band  that  includes  two  pseudo
noise signals, modulated by Biphase Shift Keying onto the carrier separated by a 90
deg phase shift.  The chip rate of the pseudo random sequences are 0.511 MHz (C/A-
code) and 5.11 MHz P-code.  Each satellite also  transmits the P-code at 5.11 MHz on
the  L2  frequency.    The  Russians  have  stated  the  P-code  is  not  included  in  the  civil
system offered for general use.

A-11

The  BPSK  modulation  produces  the  classical  sinc 2x  (sinc  x  =  sin  x  over  x)  spectrum
centred  on  the  carrier  frequency  with  nulls  at    multiples  of  the  bit  rate.    The  signal
appears to be filtered before transmission to limit the transmission bandwidth to only
the  first  two  nulls.    A  typical  spectrum  is  illustrated  in  Fig  A-2.    Some  GLONASS
satellites, but not all have been observed, Ref  2, to contain additional spectral lines
precisely at the spectral nulls of +/- the code rate.

Two theories have been put forward to explain the appearance of spectral lines at code
nulls.  The first  postulates  that  the  lines  are  present  by  accident  as  a  result  of  poor
implementation of the carrier modulation circuitry.  An alternative theory that the lines
were deliberate in order to provide instantaneous satellite velocity information has not
been  substantiated.    The  occurrence  of  the  phenomena  has  been  intermittent,
GLONASS 19 and 20 had very pronounced lines.  No lines have been observed on any
 of  the  satellites  launched  during  1986-1988  but  they    have  reappeared  on  satellites
launched in 1989 (GLONASS 42).

A.12  RANGING CODES

GLONASS employs ranging codes similar to GPS, but with the same code transmitted
by all satellites at different frequencies.  The equivalent of the GPS C/A code uses a
maximum  length  sequence  with  a  period  of  1  ms  and  a  bit  rate  of  0.511  Mchips/s,  a
length of 511 bits as compared to the GPS C/A code of 1023 bits, Ref 5.  The code is
generated by a feedback 9 element shift register, (2 9 -1 = 511bits) with feedback from
the 5th and 9th taps.  The output is taken from the 7th tap. 

The P code appears to be a truncated maximum length sequence generated by a 25 -bit
shift  register  with  feedback  from  the  3rd  and  25  taps.    A  maximum  length  code  from
such a generator has a length of 2 25 -1 = 33554431 bits.  At a clock rate of 5.11 MHz
the  code  would  be  6.5664  seconds,  but  the  sequence  is  short  cycled  at  the  second
boundary and the register reset to all ones.

A.13  NAVIGATION DATA

Navigation  data  is  transmitted  at  50  baud,  Ref  6.    In  common  with  GPS,  the  data  is
formatted into frames, sub-frames and words.  A frame has a duration of 150 seconds
and is sub-divided into five sub-frames.  Each sub-frame is divided into 15 lines, of 2
seconds duration.  The first part of each line 1.7 seconds duration contains a preamble
(always 0), line number (4 bits), data parameters (72), parity bits (8).  The C/A code
navigation data includes a 'meanda' code at double chip frequency 100 Hz, 0101010....
 is modulo 2 added to the data, resulting in a 'Manchester' modulation.  The remaining
0.3 
Hz,
111110001101110101000010010110, the last bit is aligned with even integer seconds
from the beginning of the day Moscow time UT(SU).  P-code navigation data is a non
return to zero 50 baud data message with several differences from the C/A code Ref 7.

The  data  in  each  subframe  is  divided  into  two  sections;  the  first  containing  the
coordinates and clock parameters of the transmitting satellite and the second almanac
parameters  for  all  other  satellites  currently  in  the  system.    Various  flags  occur  in  the
message relating to validity of specific data, status and health of particular satellites. 
Several  data  message  have  not  been  published  or  are  only  partially  understood,  for
example, the luni-solar  correction term in the almanacs.

GLONASS ephemerides are similar to the format used by Cicada satellites.  Both systems
encode the satellite's instantaneous position and velocity at fixed time intervals in an earth-
centred  earth-fixed (ECEF)  rectangular  coordinate  system.    Positions  and  velocities  at
intermediate times are calculated by the user using interpolation.  In addition to positional
data at reference times, GLONASS also transmits in the ephemeris two parameters relating
to the on board-clocks.  The first is a time correction for the instantaneous time difference
between  space  vehicle  time  and  GLONASS  system  time.    The  second  parameter  a
frequency  correction  gives  the  rate  of  change  of  space  vehicle  time  offset.    An  age-of-
ephemeris-data (AODE) parameter is included to allow the  user to calculate the satellites
time and frequency offset at the time the transmission occurred.

There  is  greater  similarity  between  Navstar  and  GLONASS  in  the  transmission  of
almanacs. Both systems transmit the basic elements of a osculating Kepler ellipse,  as
illustrated in Table A-3.  In terms of using almanacs to predict satellite position from the
reduced Kepler orbit, the two  sets  of  data  are  similar.  Where  differences  occur 
(parameter 8), the terms are seen to be

Almanac data provides a position of each satellite to within 100-200 m similar to GPS
almanacs. However, the inclusion in the GLONASS almanac of a luni-solar  correction
term  implies  a  position  error  perhaps  an  order  of  magnitude  better  than  a  Navstar
almanac  over  an  extended  time  period.    The  luni-solar  term  remains  substantially
constant for satellites with the same Right Ascension.  Although the almanac is valid for
 several days they are usually but not always  changed every day in GLONASS at local
 midnight.

It is interesting to observe that the GLONASS almanacs differ from the earlier Cicada
almanacs in one major respect.  The earlier almanacs were based on an equitial-tial
Kepler  set where eccentricity and argument of the perigee  are transmitted as h = e x
sinw and 1 = e x cosw.  The equinoctial set of elements is suitable for orbits with small
eccentricity since it leads to equations with no singularities when e tends to zero.

A.14   NAVIGATION REFERENCE FRAME

GLONASS employs a geocentric cartesian system designated SGS85.  The difference
from the GPS WGS84 frame is not large.  Misra, Ref 8 reported differences of less than
 20 m RMS.  The two coordinate frames may be brought together by a small rotation
0.6" (3.10-6 rad) of the z-axis and a 4 m displacement of the origin along the z-axis.

Recently there has been a suggestion that the GLONASS coordinate frame has been
updated to a SGS90 designation.

A-14

A.15  USER EQUIPMENT

A major problem with the use of GLONASS has been the lack of user equipment.  Due
to  the  initial  secrecy  of  the  system  and  the  lack  of  information  concerning  its
development few western manufactures have mature products.  Receivers are made by
3S Navigation and Leeds University.  By comparison with GPS equipments the costs
are extremely high.  A number f companies, Canadian Marconi, Trimble etc that were
developing equipments in the late 1980's are apparently in abeyance.  This decision
was  probably  made  at  the  time  when  a  GLONASS  launch  had  not  occurred  for
approximately a year and the future of the system was in doubt.  had not There has
been  some  Russian  equipment  available  vis  a  German  sources  but  supplies  were
limited.  New equipment is under development and is due to be released in late 1995.

ANNEX B:  WORLD GEODETIC SYSTEM 1984:
A MODERN AND GLOBAL REFERENCE FRAME

This article has been provided by

Dr. Muneendra Kumar

who is the Defence Mapping Agency Action Officer

for the implementation of the World Geodetic System 1984.

B.1  INTRODUCTION

In this complex world where numerous Mapping, Charting, and Geodetic (MC&G), and
digital products  are  defined  in  various  local  and/or  regional  geodetic  datums,  it
becomes a straight forward requirement to simplify MC&G complexity by referencing all
the  products  to a common  reference  frame  globally.    With  this  need  in  mind,  the
Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) has been actively involved since 1960 in the devel op-
ment of World Geodetic System (WGS).  To date, four such systems, viz., WGS 60,
WGS  66,  WGS  72,  and  WGS  84,  each  successively  more  accurate,  have  been
developed.

The  latest  WGS  84  represents  DMA's  state-of-the-art  modeling  of  the  earth  from  a
geometric, geodetic,  and  gravitational  standpoint  using  data,  techniques,  and  technology
available through early 1984.

B.2  THE REFERENCE FRAME

The origin of the WGS 84 reference frame is the earth's center of mass and the Z- and
X-axes are identical  to  the  Conventional  Terrestrial  System  (CTS)  as  defined  by  the
Bureau International de l'Heure (BIH) for the epoch 1984.0 (Figure B-1).  This frame
constitutes a mean or standard earth rotating at a constant rate (w) around an average
astronomic pole fixed in time. 

In turn, the WGS 84 reference frame is related to an Instantaneous Terrestrial System
(ITS) and a Conventional Inertial System (CIS):

WGS 84 (CTS) = [A] [B] [C] [D] CIS

(1)

where the rotation matrices for polar motion [A],sidereal [B], notation [C], and precession
[D] are from the FK 5 System referenced to Epoch J2000.0.

For practical realization, the WGS 84 reference frame or coordinate system was defined by
suitable modifying  the  NSWC9Z-2  coordinate  system  of  the  Navy  Naviga tion  Satellite
System (NNSS).  This modification consisted of the removal of biases in the origin, scale,
and longitude definition of the Doppler system and is defined as:

B-1

Figure B-1.  World Geodetic System 1984 Reference Frame

Z(WGS 84) = Z(NSWC 9Z-2) + 4.5 meters

S(WGS 84) = S(NSWC 9Z-2) - 0.6 ppm

l(WGS 84) = l(NSWC 9Z-2) + 0.814"

(2)

(3)

(4)

In  the  above  relationships,  Equations  2-4  refer  to  the  Z-axis  bias,  scale  correction,  and
longitudinal bias in the definition of the prime meridian, respectively, and the WGS 84, thus
achieved, is coincident with the BIH-defined CTS 1.

Origin = Earth's center of mass.

Z-Axis  =  Parallel  to  the  direction  of  the  Conventional  Terrestrial  Pole  (CTP)  for
polar motion, as defined by the Bureau International de L'Heure (BIH) on the basis
of the coordinates adopted for the BIH stations.

X-Axis = Intersection  of  the  WGS  84  Reference  Meridian  Plane  and  the  plane  of
the CTP's Equator,  the  Reference    Meridian  being  parallel  to  the  Zero  Meridian
defined by the BIH on the basis of the coordinates adopted for the BIH stations.

Y-Axis = Completes a right-handed, ECEF orthogonal coordinate system, measured
in the plane of the CTP Equator, 90 degrees East of the X-Axis.

B-2

B.3  THE DEFINING PARAMETERS AND ASSOCIATED CONSTANTS

In  geodetic  considerations,  three  different  surfaces  or  earth  figures  are  normally
involved  and used.    In  addition  to  the  earth's  actual  physical  surface,  the  other  two
include  a  geometric (or mathematical)  reference  surface,  the  ellipsoid,  and  an  equi -
potential surface, the geoid.  

In determining the WGS 84 Ellipsoid and its associated defining parameters, the WGS 84
Development  Committee  decided  to  adopt  the  International  Union  of  Geodesy  and
Geophysics (IUGG) defined Geodetic Reference System (GRS) 1980 as its reference.

The  WGS  84  Ellipsoid,  as  an  integral  component  of  the  system  for  the  earth's
geometric  figure and  theoretical  gravity  definition,  is  a  geocentric,  equipotential,
ellipsoid  of  revolution;  Table  B-1  lists  the  four  defining  parameters  adopted  from  the
GRS  802,  except  for  one  minor exception.    The  WGS  84  defines  C 2  instead  of  J2  of
GRS 80.

B.4  THE GRAVITY FORMULA

In many applications, such as the computation of gravity anomalies, theoretical (or normal)
gravity (g) is required as a reference value.  Values of gf in the WGS 84 (for any latitude
F) can be computed using the closed formula:

= 978032.67714 mgal
k = 0.00193185138639
e2 = 0.00669437999013.

B.5  THE EARTH GRAVITATIONAL MODEL

The Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) of the WGS 84 is a spherical harmonic expan -
sion  of the earth's  gravitational  potential  and  is  defined  complete  through  degree  (n)
and  order  (m) 180,  comprising  32.755  coefficients.    However,  only  the  coefficients
through n = m = 18 are unclassified3.

Accuracy values are not available for all the WGS 84 EGM coefficients; however, an error
covariance  matrix  is  available  only  for  coefficients  through  n  =  m  =  41,  which  were
determined from the weighted least squares solution.

B.6  THE GEOID

In addition to the earth's geometric surface or figure, the WGS 84 geoid, as the equi-
potential figure of the earth (also approximately by mean sea level over the oceans), is
defined as so many meters above (+N) or below (-N) the WGS 84 ellipsoid, where "N"
is known as geoidal height or undulation.

The worldwide geoidal heights were calculated using the WGS 84 EGM through n = m
= 180, and they can also be depicted as a contour chart (showing deviations from the
WGS 84 ellipsoid) or as a grid of desire density.  Figure B-2 shows a worldwide WGS
84  geoid  chart developed  from  a  worldwide  1  degree  x  1  degree  grid  using  the
unclassified EGM coefficients through n = m = 18.

The  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS)  geoidal  height  for  WGS  84,  taken  worldwide,  is  30.5
meters and the error ranges from  +2 to +6 meters (1s). The accuracy of the WGS 84
geoid is better than +4 meters over approximately 93% of the globe.

B.7  RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL GEODETIC DATUMS

Counting  islands  and/or  other  "astro"  datums,  the  number  of  local  geodetic  datums
available  for MC&G  requirements  and  applications  exceeds  several  hundred.    If  the
inherent  technical difficulties  of  dealing  with  these  numerous  local  datums,  e ach
defined with its own specifications and basic limitations, are considered in daily usage,
the picture is just too complex and almost chaotic. 

B-5

B-6

Under  this  bleak  scenario,  one  of  the  principal  purposes  of  a  WGS  is  to  provide  the
means whereby these numerous local geodetic datums can be referenced to a common
system (or to each other indirectly through extrapolation) and then, WGS can facilitate
simplification of the global MC&G problem.

To achieve the referencing of a local datum to WGS 84, one major requirement is to have
well-distributed control points common to both the systems.  DMA maintains a world wide
database of NNSS Doppler station.  A search of this database produced 1591 good quality
Doppler-stations, which also had coordinates defined in the local datum of the area.

These 1591 Doppler stations cover 83 local geodetic datums spread out over all the six
continents-[3].  From  a  high  of  405  Doppler  stations  common  with  the  North  American
Datum-(NAD)  1927  in  the  contiguous  U.S.,  there  are  29  datums  with  only  one  common
station.  This limitation of not having any check station thus affects about 35% (29 of 83)
of the datums.

As the local geodetic datums are generally defined only horizontally and provide mean
sea level (MSL) heights from separately defined vertical datums, the geodetic heights
in the local datum (HLD),  required  to  compute  datum  transformation  parameters,  were
generated using the following equation:

                        HLD  hmsl + NLD

(6)

In the above equation, the local datum geoidal heights (N LD) were obtained by appropriate
transformation  from  the  WGS  84  geoidal  heights.    These  local  geoids  are  absolute
(contrary to the relative astro-geodetic that are available for a few of the local datums) and
consistent in definition with each other and also with the WGS 84 geoid worldwide.

Table B-3 provides a sample listing of the transformation parameters between the 83 local
datums and the WGS 84; a full listing is available elsewhere. 4

In addition to the 83 local datums related to the WGS 84 through Doppler ties to the local
control, transformation parameters (based on non-Doppler information) are also available
for seven additional local datums.4

B.8  ACCURACY

The accuracy of the WGS 84 coordinates of a site significantly influenced by the method
used to determine the coordinates.  Table B-4 lists the four methods generally available to
establish the  coordinate  of  a  WGS  84  site  and  the  associated  accuracies  achievable
through each of the methods.

B-7

From Table B-4, it is noticed that Method 1 (where a WGS 84 site is established through
direct satellite  observational  data)  gives  the  most  accurate  positional  fix  of  1-2  meters.
Method 4 (the least accurate) is entirely dependent on the local/regional distortion of the
local geodetic datum.

B.9  SUMMARY

WGS  84  is  a  state-of-the-art  global  geodetic  reference  system  based  on  the  use  of
data,  techniques,  and  technology  available  within  DMA  through  early  1984  and
replaces  its  predecessor  WGS  72.    The  WGS  84  reference  frame,  EGM,  geoid,  and
datum  transformation parameters  (with  local  datums)  are  more  accurate  and  relate
more datums (83 compared to 27 for WGS 72).

These improvements can be translated into more accurate maps and charts, geodetic
positioning, geoidal heights, improved satellite orbits, and the capability to relate more
local datums worldwide to a unified system.

ANNEX D:  IMPACT OF MULTIPATH

Like any other types of electromagnetic waves, GPS satellite broadcasting signals are also
subject to reflection and diffraction.  GPS multipath is the antenna reception of signals not
directly  from  satellites  but  rather  bounced  off  or  diffracted  from  local  objects.    Since  the
multipath takes a longer path than the direct signal, it results in an error in pseudorange
measurements and thus affects the positioning accuracy.

If the path length of the indirect signal is more than a chip length longer than the direct
signal, the code correlator will not be able to correlate on the indirect signal.  This is the
reason why the multipath code tracking error rarely exceeds one half of the correlator chip
length, which is 150 m for the conventional C/A-code correlator. For stationary or slowly
moving users, the multipath error is on the order of a few meters or so for a period from a
few minutes to an hour.  The impact of multipath to high dynamic vehicles is even less.  The
multipath caused by man-made objects such as towers or electrical poles does not usually
last long.  However, the multipath over a vast calm water surface may continue for a while
because the water surface acts like a perfect mirror.

The effect of multipath to carrier phase measurements is less severe, typically less than a
quarter of the wavelength of the carrier.  For L1, it is approximately 5 cm.

In general, the C/A-code is more susceptible to the multipath problem than the P(Y)-code
due to the relatively narrower bandwidth, that is 2 MHz for the C/A-code versus 20 MHz for
the  P(Y)-code.    With  recent  advances  in  narrow  correlation  technology,  the  C/A-code
multipath  susceptibility  can  match  the  conventional  P(Y)-code  per formance.    The  same
technology can also be applied to the P(Y)-code to enhance its multi path susceptibility by
increasing the bandwidth from 20 MHz to 80 MHz with 0.2 chip spacing.

Since multipath is not easily predictable and not spatially correlated between two antennas
except  for  a  very  short  baseline,  it  causes  a  major  problem  for  differential  operation. 
Therefore it is important to understand the nature of multipath and hopefully eliminate its
impact to GPS receiver performance.

How to Identify Multipath:

For  a  stationary  antenna,  such  as  the  one  used  in  a  ground  reference  station  for
differential  GPS  operation,  the  multipath  can  be  identified  by  monitor ing  the  GPS
signal with a second antenna separated by sufficient distance so that the multipath
observed in one antenna will not be seen in the other.  A significant difference in
pseudorange measurements between two  antennas, after proper compensation for
their  locations,  is  a  strong  indication  of  multipath.    The  observed  discrepancies
should  repeat  after  23  hours  and  56  minutes  due  to  the  GPS  constellation
periodicity,  providing  further  proof  of  the  existence  of  multipath.    To  illustrate  the
repeatability  of  this  phenomenon,  Figure  E-1  shows  the  multipath  induced  north
position  error  over  four  consecutive  days  in  San  Diego,  CA.    As  shown,  the
multipath  error  occurs  near  the  same  time  of  the  day  except  that  it  advances  4
minute every day.

D-1

the  carrier 

For a moving vehicle, the multipath can theoretically be isolated by comparing the code-
tracking  pseudorange  measurements  and 
integrated  Doppler
measurements.    Because  the  integrated  Doppler  multipath  is  only  on  the  order  of  a  few
centimeters,  the  differences  between  the  two  are  primarily  due  to  the  multipath  in  the
pseudorange  measurements.    In  order  to  make  this  technique  work,  the  mean  value  of
differences  over  a  fixed  period  of  time  has  to  be  removed  in  order  to  eliminate  integer
ambiguity in the integrated Doppler measurements.  In an environment free of multipath,
differences after removal of the mean are primarily due to receiver noise which should be
less than a meter.  Anything larger is an indication of possible multipath.

tracking 

Another technique to identify multipath is to examine the carrier signal-to-noise ratio.  When
multipath occurs, the coherency of the composite signal (direct plus reflected) makes the
magnitude  oscillate  with  time  depending  upon  the  relative  phase.    There fore,  another
indication of multipath is that the carrier signal-to-noise ratio appears to vary periodically.

Since the multipath is highly geometry-dependent, when it appears, it only affects one or
two satellites.  For differential GPS operation, it is possible to use RAIM based algorithms
to identify the existence of multipath of a specific satellite and then exclude the erroneous
measurement  from  the  position  computation.  There  are  two  impor tant  factors  that  are
critical to the success of this technique.  One is that six or more satellites are needed to
exclude the measurement with multipath using a RAIM based algorithm.  The other is that
the receiver must operate in differential mode so that the multipath, instead of SA, becomes
the dominant error source.

How to Reduce Multipath:

The most straightforward method to reduce multipath is to move the antenna to a multipath-
free location.  This is usually done by placing the antenna as low as possible and away
from huge buildings.  Sometimes, this is not possible due to physical restrictions.  Another
approach is to increase the masking angle as long as enough high elevation satellites are
in  view.    This  is  because  multipath  often  appears  in  the  low  elevation  satellites  for  two
reasons: (1) direct signal strength is weaker for low elevation satellites and (2) the increase
in  propagation  path  is  smaller.    Other  more  advanced  candidate  solutions  to  reduce
multipath are discussed in the following:

1.

2.

An effective approach is to monitor the pseudorange measurements using a
receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) algorithm or carrier phase
integrated Doppler.  When a pseudorange measurement is suspected to be
contaminated with multipath, either significantly reduce the weight or remove
it completely from the position computation.

Because most of the reflected signal comes from below the Earth's
surface, another effective approach to reduce the impact of this kind of
multipath is to place the antenna directly on a large ground plane in
order to shape the antenna pattern, so that is has no sidelobe under
the horizon.  If a large ground  plane is not practical, another method is
to use a choke ring, which is much smaller in size and works equally
well.  The choke ring consists of

D-2

several rings with their diameters tuned to the GPS frequencies.  When
the reflected signal enters the antenna via edge diffraction, it will be
"choked" in these rings, thus attenuating the multipath.  For example, as
shown in Figure D-1, the results on June 14 and 16 were obtained with an
antenna mounted on a choke ring while on June 15 and 17 without a
choke ring.  As can be seen, the choke ring attenuated the multipath error
by nearly 50%.

3.

A new technique to reduce the multipath is to narrow the receiver's early-
late  correlator  spacing  in  the  implementation  of  delay  lock  loops,
especially  in  C/A-code  tracking  applications.    It  was  reported  in  the
Journal of the Institute of Navigation, "Theory and Performance of Narrow
Correlator Spacing in a GPS-Receiver", that 3 to 4 times improvement is
achievable.  Further research is-still needed to explore the full benefits of
this technique.
