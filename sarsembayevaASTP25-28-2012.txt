Abstract 

 
Was  defined  reconnection  rate  of  solar  flares  observed  with  the  SOHO 
Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI). Measured physical parameters of 15 flares, 
such  as  the  temporal  scale,  size  and  magnetic  flux  density.  Estimated 
reconnection  inflow  velocity,  coronal  Alfven  velocity,  and  reconnection  rate 
using the observed values. 
 

Keywords: solar flares, corona, magnetic fields

In  the  energy  release  process  in  solar  flares,  magnetic  reconnection  is 
generally  considered  to  play  a  key  role.  The  reconnection  rate  is  an  important 
quantity, because it puts critical restrictions on the reconnection model. It is defined 
inV   is  the  velocity  of  the 
as 
AV  is the Alfven velocity. It gives the normalized value of 
reconnection inflow and 
the  reconnected  flux  per  unit  time.  In  spite  of  its  importance,  what  determines  the 
reconnection rate in flares is still a question [1].

where  L  is the characteristic size of the flare and 
corB  is the characteristic magnetic 
flux density in the corona. Since the released magnetic energy balances the energy 
flowing into the reconnection region, we can describe the energy release rate as
