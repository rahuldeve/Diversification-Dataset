Hudson River Estuary Program

The Hudson River Estuary Program is a unique regional partnership designed to protect, 
conserve, restore, and enhance the estuarys productivity and diversity of natural resourc-
es to sustain a wide array of present and future human benefits. The Hudson River is a 
nursery for valuable food and game fish, a water supply, a boaters playground, a land-
scape of inspiring beauty, a shipping route, and more.  Therefore, its management calls 
for a cooperative effort of broad scope, coordinating public input with the expertise of 
professionals throughout New York States Department of Environmental Conservation 
(NYSDEC) and other agencies.

The Hudson River Estuary Action Agenda identifies priority actions to be taken to con-
serve the natural resources of the estuary and its associated shore lands.  One of those 
priorities is conservation of biodiversity in the Hudson River Valley and the greater  
Hudson Estuary ecosystem.

This report describes significant habitats of the Hudson River Valley and identifies vol-
untary, non-regulatory strategies for conserving wildlife and habitat in the region.

The development of this document is the product of a team effort involving the Biodi-
versity Program Steering Committee under the leadership of the New York State De-
partment of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Hudson River Estuary Program 
and the New York Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at Cornell University.

We gratefully acknowledge the significant involvement and input of the Steering Com-
mittee.  Their expertise, insights, and suggestions were instrumental in shaping the 
development of this report and, indeed, the biodiversity and terrestrial habitat elements 
of the overall estuary management program.  Because the Steering Committee delibera-
tions have been so important to the development of the final product and, because so 
many individuals have contributed to this effort, committee members and their affili-
ations are listed in Appendix I.  The report is improved by a number of illustrative 
figures, maps and photographs and we thank all of those who provided these materials.
Of particular note in the development of this framework for conservation planning and 
action in the Hudson River Valley are four NYSDEC employees who have teamed up 
to provide a platform for this project, and impetus for the overall Hudson River Estuary 
Program.  For their vision, leadership, support and encouragement; and, for their sup-
port of field research, data interpretation, and preparation of this report we thank Francis 
Dunwell, Arthur Johnsen, Ted Kerpez, and Maynard Vance all from NYSDEC Regions 
3 and 4.

Lastly, we thank Milo Richmond, Unit Leader of the New York Cooperative Fish and 
Wildlife Research Unit at Cornell for suggestions, research planning, facilitation of em-
ployee and field research needs, and for offering an opportunity for professional growth. 
His support, involvement, and friendship have helped the effort in measurable ways.

Much of the drafting, redrafting, original thinking and creative writing for this docu-
ment have been the work of Mark Penhollow, Paul Jensen and Leslie Zucker who have 
gone the distance to capture the ideas, intent, and specific facts that came from so many 
sources and are so important to the integrity of this document.

Several publications were particularly valuable in development of the framework.  De-
scriptions of significant biodiversity areas and habitats were supplemented by extensive 
surveys, reports, and personal communications from the NY Natural Heritage Program.  
Characterizations of significant habitats were enriched by high quality habitat profiles 
included in the Biodiversity Assessment Manual for the Hudson River Estuary Corridor 
developed by Hudsonia, Limited.  Background information on terrestrial habitats and 
vertebrates, and the status of their conservation was found in the Hudson River Val-
ley Gap Analysis completed by the NY Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit.   
Original descriptions of the ecological communities found in the Hudson River Valley 
were taken from Reschkes Ecological Communities of New York State (1990) pub-
lished by NYSDEC.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation provided support for 
the development of this document from the Environmental Protection Fund through the 
Hudson River Estuary Program.

Executive Summary

Purpose
The Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Framework describes key plant and animal 
habitats in the 15 New York State counties bordering the Hudson River Estuary from the 
Federal Dam at Troy to its confluence with the ocean, an area which contains most of the 
lower Hudson watershed. It also identifies strategies for the protection of these habitats. 
The report is intended to assist individuals, non-profit groups, and government officials 
in developing partnerships to conserve our regions natural heritage, emphasizing volun-
tary measures and utilizing local home rule. It was developed as part of the Hudson River 
Estuary Action Agenda, led by the New York State Department of Environmental Conser-
vation (NYSDEC). 

Plant and Animal Habitat in the Hudson River Estuary Region
The Hudson River begins as a small mountain lake on the side of the states highest peak, 
Mt. Marcy, and ends in New York Harbor, one of the worlds busiest and most populated 
metropolitan ports. About halfway along its course it becomes an estuary, an arm of the 
sea, that provides spawning and nursery grounds for commercially valuable fish, crabs, 
and shellfish. The Rivers uplands are covered with forests interspersed with working 
farms, residential development, and small cities. These lands support a high diversity of 
species of global and national significance. The Hudson Valleys varied geology creates 
a tapestry of habitats, such as pine barrens, grasslands, cliffs, mountain ranges, caves, 
streams, and wetlands, including globally rare freshwater tidal wetlands. This mix of 
habitats gives the region exceptional importance.

The region, comprising only 13.5% of the land area of the entire state, contains nearly 
85% of the bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species found in New York State. It is 
important worldwide for its rich diversity of turtles, and nationwide for its dragonflies 
and damselflies. It offers opportunities found nowhere else in the state for conservation 
of amphibian and reptile biodiversity. A number of species use the Hudson Valley as a 
migration route or as breeding or nursery habitat. This includes migratory fishes such as 
shad, sturgeon, and striped bass, as well as insects such as the monarch butterfly. Birds 
as varied as the cerulean warbler, marsh wren, bald eagle, osprey, and ruby-throated 
hummingbird all spend part of their life cycle in the Valley and part of it in places as far 
away as Nova Scotia and South America.

The Hudson River Estuary ecosystem is home to a number of species that have their best 
or only remaining populations in the region. Such species include the northern cricket 
frog, sable clubtail dragonfly, Kentucky warbler, timber rattlesnake, the bog turtle, Karner 
blue butterfly, and Indiana bat. Approximately 150 species in the watershed are listed by 
the NYSDEC as threatened, endangered, or of special concern in New York State. Of the 
11 turtle species found in the Hudson Valley, 6 are on state or federal lists of endangered, 
threatened, or special concern animals, primarily due to habitat loss. 

v

While some species flourish in the Hudson River Valley, others are threatened and 
some species not now listed as endangered are on the decline. Urbanization and habitat 
fragmentation are a major concern.  Species that require connections between habitat 
types to complete stages in their life cycles cannot survive if these connections are 
broken. For example, wood frogs, spotted salamanders, and marbled salamanders 
require wetlands for breeding and must have adjacent woodlands for their adult stage. 
Animals that rely on large unbroken tracts of forest, such as the bobcat, wood thrush, 
cerulean warbler, and red-shouldered hawk can become vulnerable when such forest 
lands are broken up. Agricultural lands also provide important habitat. Meadows and 
shrubby fields found on Hudson Valley farms can support species such as the bog turtle, 
northern harrier, bobolink, meadowlark, and golden-winged warbler. Many of these 
species are declining in the valley as agricultural land uses decrease.

Pollution and competition with invasive or overabundant species create problems for 
some species. At least 10 percent of the 3,600 miles of tributary stream habitat in the 
Hudson Valley are stressed from agricultural and urban runoff, erosion, dams, loss of 
riparian buffers, and reduced groundwater recharge. Invasive species crowd out native 
species that serve as food and shelter for many of the regions insects and small animals. 
Many of these invasives take hold where human practices give them an extra boost.

The region is one of the most densely populated areas in the country, and its land is 
changing fast.  According to a report released in 2001 by the Brookings Institution, 
between 1992 and 1997, urbanized land use in the NYC metropolitan area grew at 
three times the rate of population growth, and in the Albany Capital District urban land 
use grew at six times the rate of population growth (Fulton et al. 2001). This rapid 
land conversion creates an urgent challenge to organizations and agencies faced with 
finding new ways to include conservation in the regions growth strategy. Protecting 
habitat does not require that growth stop however, human developments will need to be 
sensitively placed to maintain important habitats and fit the needs of wildlife species.

Public lands are making an important contribution to biodiversity conservation in 
the Hudson River Valley, particularly for species that require large forested tracts. A 
century of open space acquisition has created large intact habitats in the Highlands, the 
Palisades, the Taconics, and the Catskills. However, 90% or more of the suitable habitat 
for the regions birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles is found on private lands. 
Furthermore, 23 of these species are not thought to occur at all on public land. While 
land acquisition will play a role in protecting some of these species, it cannot be the 
primary strategy. These trends highlight the need for conservation options that can be 
adopted by interested parties. 

Local Conservation Opportunities
Key steps in conserving the richness of the Hudsons heritage can be taken by local 
planning boards and property owners. Local home rule gives residents the ability to 
create and maintain the character of their communities and provides great latitude to 

vi

communities that want to conserve their natural and biological resources. In order to 
make informed decisions, communities will need to identify their unique conservation 
opportunities. Municipalities can then identify critical areas for habitat and natural 
resource protection and prioritize areas suitable for development. This strategy can 
increase residential property values, thus providing additional revenue for municipalities. 
In addition, this approach improves water and air quality and provides a community with 
space to experience the beauty of nature. By guiding development patterns now, towns 
can avoid the costs of urban and suburban sprawl and preserve the sensitive wildlife 
habitat that nurtures the Valleys unique heritage of native plants and animals. 

Individual landowners can also take action to protect these important habitats in 
the Hudson River Valley. Biodiversity conservation can be folded into private land 
stewardship in order to stem the loss of species and their habitats.  With the Wildlife and 
Habitat Conservation Framework, the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program hopes 
to provide a road map for individuals and communities to make informed decisions about 
land use and conservation.

The Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Framework
The Framework is divided into three parts. Part I provides an overview of the biodiversity 
issues in the region, discusses the importance of biodiversity in our daily lives, and 
highlights the major threats to biodiversity. Part II defines significant Hudson Valley 
habitat types, describes some of the characteristic plants and animals they support, and 
identifies their unique conservation challenges. Part III proposes various strategies for 
protecting our resources by working with a variety of partners to meet the needs of both 
people and of wildlife. It emphasizes approaches that work within New Yorks long 
tradition of home rule and property rights.

The information contained in the Framework builds upon 10 years of work to catalog 
the species and habitats of the region that form the ecosystem of the Hudson River 
Estuary. Since the release of the first Hudson River Estuary Action Agenda, NYSDEC 
has completed a number of wildlife and habitat inventory projects. Many of these studies 
were conducted in collaboration with state, nonprofit, federal, and academic partners. 
Collectively, they provide a solid, science-based approach to conservation and a useful 
source of data for further research and implementation of conservation practices. 

On-going inventory projects monitor and predict the distribution of terrestrial 
vertebrates, breeding birds, amphibians and reptiles, rare plant and animal populations, 
and exceptional habitat areas. The information collected is used to determine habitats 
of particular significance in the region. Analyses of the data compiled suggest that the 
following major habitat types and associated wildlife species are most significant in this 
region:

vii

	 Coastal Habitats

Coastal habitats include sand beaches, mudflats, coves, salt marshes, tidal wetlands, 
and tidal creeks. These habitats support waterfowl, colonial wading birds, marine 
and estuarine fishes, and many species of turtles, molluscs, and raptors, including the 
nations symbol of freedom, the bald eagle. Dredge spoil disposal, bulkheads, and 
construction fill for urban and industrial development have damaged or eliminated 
large areas of subtidal shallows habitat. In addition, impoundments, dams, and 
floodplain filling currently block the migration routes for many economically 
important species that require temporarily flooded riparian wetlands and abandoned 
channel meanders (oxbows) in order to complete their life cycles. Coastal habitats 
are also impacted by surrounding land uses, tributary water quality, and recreational 
activities. Key restoration and preservation strategies should be considered at 
individual sites to restore native plant communities, restore fish passage and spawning 
habitat, improve tidal flow, and enhance water quality along our coastlines.

	 Wetlands

The Hudson River Estuary region contains a rich diversity of wetland types, from 
freshwater tidal swamps and brackish tidal marshes to fens, bogs, and forested 
wetlands.  These habitats are home to a variety of species including the federally-
listed black duck, wood  frog, the threatened Blandings turtle, marbled and Jefferson 
salamanders, muskrat, and beaver. Unfortunately, more than 50% of the wetlands in 
the region have been lost since European settlement. Wetland conservation strategies 
should include, where possible, the restoration and protection of wetland hydrology 
and wetland plant communities, control of invasive species, and management 
of certain types of wetlands through mowing and grazing. Inland intermittent 
vernal pools, a common but threatened wetland habitat type, should be identified 
and conserved along with surrounding critical woodland habitat, and best forest 
management practices can be used to protect them from pollution and disturbance.

	 Tributaries and Riparian Areas

High quality tributaries, riparian areas, and floodplain forests are important habitat 
for many species including trout and black bass, salamanders, river otters, beaver, 
cerulean warbler, and wood turtles.  Aquatic animals are highly dependent on riparian 
areas for shade, leaves (as a source of food), edge-of-channel habitat structure (such 
as undercut banks), soil stabilization, and woody debris. Removal of riparian areas, 
modification of stream channels, and increasing impervious surfaces cause some of 
the changes to watershed hydrology that are putting the water and habitat quality 
of tributary streams in the Hudson River Valley at risk. Minimizing development 
in riparian corridors, minimizing the hydrological alteration of stream systems, 
protecting native floodplain meadows and forests, and restoring natural stream 
channels will help to protect stream biodiversity. Removal of obsolete dams or the 
construction of fish passage structures can restore fish migration and sediment and 
temperature regimes.

viii

	 Unfragmented Forest and Habitat Corridors

Intact forests are summer breeding habitat for migratory songbirds, bobcats, black 
bear, wood thrush, barred owl, and red-shouldered hawks. Although few examples of
old-growth lowland forest remain, forests of moderate-sized and moderate-aged 
trees continue to provide valuable habitat and have the potential to provide mature 
forest habitat in the future. Many of the biological communities that characterized 
unfragmented forests are at risk in areas of the Hudson Valley. We can preserve the 
species that depend on unfragmented forests and habitat corridors by conserving 
mature lowland forests, concentrating disturbance along the edge of forest blocks, 
restoring forest fragments in riparian areas, reforesting gaps between disconnected 
forest tracts, and controlling invasive species while managing for well-developed 
growth on the forest floor, .

	 Open Uplands and Barrens

This habitat type includes grasslands, shrublands, agricultural lands, and rarer 
communities such as pitch-pine scrub-oak barrens, and rocky summit grasslands. 
These areas represent increasingly rare habitat for bobolinks, meadowlarks, 
grasshopper sparrows, golden-winged warblers, fox, northern harrier (hawks), 
butterflies, and the state endangered bog turtle. Without management or disturbance, 
early successional habitats become forest. Many of these animals are now declining 
due to reforestation or development of lands that were once meadows. Maintenance 
of early successional habitat should be balanced with the need to conserve stands of 
unfragmented forest. Control of invasives combined with reintroduction of native 
species will help to restore degraded sand plains. Conserving large, continuous 
parcels of open habitat on rocky summits and facilitating infrequent mowing or 
prescribed fire treatment in lowland areas will help to retain a mix of grasses, woody 
plants, seedlings, and saplings that provide essential habitat. Outreach to agricultural 
communities is integral to the preservation of this habitat type.

	 Caves and Cliffs

These habitat types were formed during ancient mountain-building processes or 
during mining exploration. They are used by rare cliff ferns, bats, peregrine falcons, 
migrating hawks, and rock-cresses. Approximately 40% of the state occurrences 
of the eastern small-footed bat and 3 of the 8 federally endangered Indiana bat 
hibernacula in New York State are found in the Hudson River Valley. Rare cliff plants 
such as the spleenwort, prickly pear, purple cliffbrake, and three-toothed cinquefoil 
can be found in the regions mountains.  Cliff areas also provide overwintering habitat 
for many snake species, support the silvery blue and orange tip butterflies, and serve 
as migration pathways for several hawk species. Cliff and cave inventories should 
be conducted in the region and conservation measures should be taken to protect 
sensitive portions of these habitats from land-use practices that can be damaging, 
such as mining and high volume recreational activities like rock climbing, hiking, and 
mountain biking.

ix

The Framework identifies 23 land areas representing these habitat types in the Hudson 
Valley that are particularly significant to biodiversity. With almost 89% of the estuarys 
conservation area in private ownership, landowners, non-profits, sporting clubs, and 
businesses can play a key role in meeting the goals and targets of the Hudson River 
Estuary Action Agenda. The NYSDEC intends to continue developing a network of 
partners to improve the overall quality of the Hudson Valley landscape through incentive-
based voluntary conservation programs.

Tools are described in this Framework that will allow residents to identify habitat areas 
that provide the highest benefits to the local environmental quality and integrity of the 
Hudson Valley region. While local residents can best identify the important cultural and 
environmental features of their communities, there are many partners within the Hudson 
River Valley that can provide assistance. Grants are available through the Hudson River 
Estuary Program to carry out habitat assessment, education, and restoration projects. 
State wildlife biologists are available for consultation, and many non-profit organizations 
offer technical guidance and services to Hudson River Valley residents, governments, and 
community groups.

The publication of the Conservation Framework is designed to help achieve the 
objectives of the Hudson River Estuary Action Agenda to conserve the rich diversity of 
plants, animals, and habitats of the Hudson River Estuary region for future generations. 
Other projects of the Hudson River Estuary Program include technical assistance for local 
governments in conservation planning and training for local citizens in how to assess 
biodiversity.

The actions of the Hudson River Estuary Program are wide-ranging  from creating 
access to clean swimming waters, to upgrading sewage treatment plants, to restoring 
robust fisheries, and protecting the watershed. Conserving the biodiversity of the Hudson 
River Valley is a key aspect of this mission.

Overview

Background
The Hudson River Estuary corridor is truly one of the great regions of the world and a 
special place within the Empire State.  It is a region of remarkable beauty, historical and 
economic significance, and importantly, high biological diversity.  From tidal wetlands 
and coastal ecosystems to high elevation spruce-fir forest, the region boasts a remark-
able diversity of habitats, and species that depend on those habitats.  Turtles, snakes, bats, 
frogs, salamanders, birds of prey, songbirds, waterfowl, mollusks, butterflies, old-growth 
trees, and unique freshwater tidal wetlands are a few examples of an extensive list that 
describes the biodiversity of the greater Hudson River Estuary ecosystem.  Humans are 
an important part of the environment within the Hudson River ecosystem and are depen-
dent on the regions abundant natural resources.  From the rarest to the most common, we 
must strive to conserve the native plants, wildlife, and ecological communities that make 
this area so special and at the same time, work with people and communities to ensure 
that their needs are addressed. 

Estuaries are bodies of water, such as rivers or bays, along coasts where the tides carry 
water inland. In the Hudson River, tides reach as far north as the Federal Dam at Troy and 
form an estuary. The tidal Hudson River estuary begins as freshwater in Troy, gradually 
turns brackish near the Hudson Highlands, and becomes noticeable salty at the Tappan 
Zee Bridge.  The Hudson River Estuary corridor, extending from the Troy Dam to the 
Verrazano Narrows below Manhattan Island, and including the counties bordering the 
estuary, is the focus of New York States Hudson River Estuary Program.  In order to 
fully appreciate, understand, and manage the Hudson River Estuary, it is necessary to 
consider it in the context of its surrounding landscape and watershed.  For the Estuary to 
be healthy, the neighboring lands and forests, and tributary rivers that flow into it must 
also be healthy.

To date, results from our efforts have revealed that the ecosystems surrounding the Hud-
son River Estuary support a remarkable array of vegetative cover types.  This diversity 
of land cover is reflected in an abundance of wildlife species, some of which have all or 
a significant portion of their entire New York range within the Hudson River Estuary cor-
ridor.  For example, 25 of 31 vegetative cover types identified for all of New York State 
occur within the 4.2 million acre Hudson River Estuary corridor, an area representing 
about 13.5% of the land area of New York.  For all New York terrestrial vertebrates com-
bined, 86% (308 species) have predicted occurrences from the corridor.  Within this total, 
the Hudson River Estuary corridor provides habitat for 85% (28 species) of New Yorks 
amphibian species, 73% (27 species) of New Yorks reptile species, 87% (199 species) of 
New Yorks breeding bird species, and 92% (54 species) of New Yorks mammal species 
(Smith et al. 2001).

This remarkable diversity in some instances takes on global significance.  In the case of 
turtles, the Hudson River watershed has a rich diversity of species, many of which are 

1

endangered.  The number of species found in the Hudson River watershed is matched in 
only a few other rivers in the world, including the Suawanee (Florida), Mekong (south-
east Asia), and Irrawaddy (Myanmar).

In the last five years, the Biodiversity Program of the Hudson River Estuary Program has 
completed a number of projects in collaboration with partners to conserve the Hudson 
River Estuarys rich ecosystem.  These collaborative projects include identification and 
mapping of wildlife habitats from satellite imagery, surveys of rare plant and animal com-
munities and significant ecological communities, monitoring of PCB levels to determine 
potential affects on nesting eagles, expansion of the Hudson River Valley portion of the 
NYS Amphibian and Reptile Atlas, initiation of a Hudson River Valley Breeding Bird At-
las to expand and complement the statewide effort, development of a manual and related 
training for biodiversity assessment, collection and continued analysis of the movement 
of contaminants in the food chain, grants for conservation and stewardship projects, out-
reach and technical assistance to Hudson Valley municipalities, surveying bog turtles in 
the lower Hudson River Watershed, and publication of this conservation framework.

Development of a conservation framework evolved out of the need to provide current 
information on the biological resources of the area and strategies by which agencies, 
organizations, and individuals could work collaboratively to achieve realistic conserva-
tion goals.  This project emphasizes voluntary approaches that can be undertaken in the 
context of local home rule.  No new state regulations are proposed.  The conservation of 
our biological diversity will likely be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, from 
outreach aimed at land-use planners, to open space protection, to partnerships with land-
owners to foster conservation practices at home.

Truly effective biodiversity conservation in the Hudson River Estuary corridor will em-
brace all available conservation tools and will result from empowering people and com-
munities to make informed decisions in their daily lives.  Indeed, a conservation program 
cannot succeed without a high level of public involvement.  The Hudson River Estuary 
Program has initiated a biodiversity outreach and technical assistance program to con-
tinue expanding voluntary partnerships with local communities.  In addition to training, 
outreach, and education, biodiversity conservation will be carried forward by projects to 
develop maps and other informational products that interpret biological survey results; 
examine the contribution of public lands to biodiversity conservation; continue local 
training for biodiversity assessment; monitor changes in the regions land use and wildlife 
communities, and continue to offer grants for conservation and stewardship projects.

Purpose of the Framework
Given the tremendous biological diversity of the region and the complexity of the issues 
that surround its conservation, a document is needed to identify the biological resources 
of the Hudson River Estuary corridor and to recommend strategies for the conservation 

2

of those resources.  This report should help to coordinate the activities of conservation 
agencies and organizations in the Hudson River Valley by establishing a framework and 
approach for biodiversity conservation.

The purpose of the Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Framework is to provide a founda-
tion for a coordinated biodiversity conservation program that includes research, manage-
ment, education, and outreach, and that incorporates conservation considerations into 
sound land-use planning through the use of a broad range of voluntary measures and 
conservation tools.

This report establishes a framework that can be applied to:

1)   Defining conservation objectives and priorities;

2)   Integrating biodiversity conservation considerations into sound land-use planning 

practices in the context of local home rule;

3)   Promoting the use of a broad range of conservation tools, especially measures that 

can be undertaken voluntarily; and

4)   Establishing partnerships among federal, state, and local governments, as well as 

communities, businesses, private organizations, and individuals.

The Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Framework is a product of the Hudson River Es-
tuary Biodiversity Program of the New York State Department of Environmental Conser-
vation (NYSDEC) Hudson River Estuary Program.  It was developed under the direction 
of a steering committee representing more than 20 organizations interested and experi-
enced in biodiversity conservation in the Hudson River Valley (Appendix I).

Intended Audience
We hope that the Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Framework is useful for those orga-
nizations and individuals working to conserve the biological diversity and uniqueness of 
the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  In particular, it is intended to aide conservationists in 
establishing coordinated efforts.

While these efforts should evolve at different levels of organization, biodiversity conser-
vation is most effective when it takes place at the local level through a variety of indi-
viduals and groups (i.e., citizens, citizens groups, community organizations, planning 
boards).  Resources are available for these groups as part of the Hudson River Estuary 
Biodiversity Program.

Overview of the Conservation Framework
This report is organized into three sections, Part I: An Approach to Biodiversity Conser-
vation, Part II: Significant Habitats of the Hudson River Valley, and Part III: Conservation 
Strategies and Recommendations. 

Part I: An Approach to Biodiversity Conservation
Part I provides an overview of the Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program and 
discusses biodiversity conservation within the context of the Hudson River Estuary 
corridor.  The section focuses on the value of biodiversity in our lives, primary threats 
to biodiversity in the region, and considerations for biodiversity conservation.

Part II: Significant Habitats of the Hudson River Valley
Part II provides an overview of significant habitats in the Hudson River Valley and 
includes general information on the ecology and conservation of cave and cliff 
habitats, coastal habitats, open uplands and barrens, tributaries and riparian habitat, 
unfragmented forests and habitat corridors, and wetlands.  Following each description 
is a list and map of significant biodiversity areas that contain that habitat type.  Then, 
descriptions are provided for each significant biodiversity area in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor.

Information presented in Part II is the foundation of a habitat-based approach to bio-
diversity conservation in the Estuary corridor.

Part III: Conservation Strategies and Recommendations
Part III outlines key program areas and strategies that should be developed or expand-
ed to meet regional conservation goals and address the primary threats to biodiversity 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  The conservation strategies recommended in 
this document emphasize voluntary measures that can be undertaken in the context of 
local home rule and individual property rights.  Implementation of conservation strat-
egies should occur through a variety of mechanisms involving federal, state, and local 
governments, as well as private organizations with a common vision for conserving 
biodiversity.

In general, conservation program areas presented in this document can be grouped 
into three major categories: biological inventories  and ecological research, land man-
agement and environmental quality, and education.  Some recommendations require 
a long-term commitment (e.g., ecological monitoring) and may rely substantially on 
funds provided by state and federal agencies.  Other strategies will require broad-
based support from a variety of organizations ranging from government agencies to 
local communities and citizens.  Lastly, for some strategies, significant involvement 
by communities will be required to address issues at the local level.

Periodic Updates
The Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program embraces an adaptive approach to bio-
diversity conservation whereby we learn from both our successes and failures and adjust 
our approach accordingly, using all available information.  It is recommended that the 
information contained in this report be evaluated every two years and updated as needed.

Conditions in the Hudson River Valley are continually changing.  Threats to biodiversity 
evolve over time; some threats will be resolved through concerted conservation action 
while new threats could arise.  New conservation strategies and actions will need to be 
undertaken and old strategies discontinued (as appropriate) in response to changing con-
ditions.  In addition, available information and knowledge of biodiversity will also grow 
with time.  The databases on which conservation strategies and actions are based are 
continually updated.  Regular updates are essential to maintaining an effective and mean-
ingful conservation program.

PART I:  An Approach to Biodiversity Conservation

Introduction
The Hudson River Valley is one of New York States most impressive regions, rich in 
history, and cultural, geological, and biological diversity (Figure 1).  At the heart of this 
region is the Hudson River Estuary, which ranges from saline to fresh water, and pulses 
daily with four-foot ocean tides.  The Hudson River Estuary corridor is one of the most 
densely populated areas of the country and has long been the fastest growing region of 
the state.  Additionally, it is one of the states primary industrial centers.  As a result, 
tremendous pressures have been placed on the health and sustainability of the regions 
natural resources.  Despite these stresses, it remains highly productive with thousands of 
species of plants and animals. 

Because of the diversity and complexity of both the biological resources and the threats 
that face these resources, partnerships involving landowners, municipalities, non-profit 
organizations, government agencies, and others must be developed to effectively con-
serve biodiversity in the Hudson River Valley.  Successful implementation of the strate-
gies and actions presented in this report will require a commitment to both developing 
and sustaining these partnerships.

The Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program
The purpose of the Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program is to support the conser-
vation, recovery, and sustainable use of the biodiversity of the Hudson River Estuary cor-
ridor, especially as it relates to terrestrial ecosystems.  The program emphasizes voluntary 
approaches to biodiversity conservation in the context of local home rule.

The broad goals of the program are:

1.  To maintain biodiversity in the Hudson River Estuary ecosystem by ensuring the 
health of all native, terrestrial ecological communities, including plant and animal 
species, and by protecting ecological processes and overall ecosystem function.

2.  To assure opportunities for the public to experience, learn about, and enjoy the 

abundant biodiversity resources of the Hudson River Estuary ecosystem.

Conservation Area
The Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program and this report address biodiversity 
and conservation opportunities for the terrestrial portions of the Hudson River Estuary 
ecosystem within the Hudson River Valley.  The conservation area is the entire upland 
area (terrestrial habitat and non-tidal and tidal wetlands) of the ten counties bordering the 
Hudson River Estuary from the Troy Dam south to the Verrazano Narrows.  Also includ-
ed are the 5 New York City Boroughs (New York, Bronx, Queens, Kings, Richmond).  
The Hudson River Estuary corridor spans approximately 152 miles and covers more than 

7

 

6,500 square miles, greater than the combined areas of Rhode Island and Connecticut 
(Figure 2).  This definition of the conservation area closely matches the drainage basin 
boundaries for the Hudson River Estuary, which is tidal as far north as the Federal Dam 
at Troy.
 
 
Areas beyond the Hudson River Estuary Watershed can and do have a profound effect on 
the estuary and surrounding lands.  What happens deep in the neighboring watersheds of 
the Upper Hudson River in the Adirondacks, the Delaware in the western Catskills, and 
throughout the Northeast influences biodiversity in and around the Hudson River.  Con-
servation strategies must consider these areas as well, but are not covered in this report.
 
 
Biodiversity Defined
Biological diversity, or biodiversity, refers to the abundance and variety of all life on 
earth.  It embodies all of the variety among animals, plants, and microorganisms, their 
genetic makeup, and the variety of ecosystems in which they live.  The definition of 
biodiversity encompasses three different levels: genetic diversity, species diversity, and 
ecosystem diversity.  Genetic diversity includes genetic variation between species, as well 
as within and between populations of the same species.  Species diversity refers to the 
variety of different plants, animals, and microorganisms.  Ecosystem diversity refers to 
variability in scale, process, and abiotic factors that define the system.  Genetic, species, 
and ecosystem diversity are all essential to maintaining long-term biodiversity.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Biodiversity Value
Biodiversity has tremendous value to humans and should be protected for many reasons.  
Humans are interdependent with other organisms on the planet.  Our quality of life is 
inextricably tied to a healthy and diverse environment.  We have benefited tremendously 
from an environment rich in biological variety, from ecological services to aesthetics, 
recreation, and spiritual benefits.

An investment for the future
One reason we engage in biodiversity conservation is to maintain environmental systems 
that support quality of life, both for the present and for future generations.  Without 
conservation, future generations may be left with impoverished biological resources. 
Biodiversity can help ecosystems recover more readily from disturbances resulting from 
drought, flooding, fire, disease, or human activities. Maintaining biodiversity provides us 
with options for adapting and responding to changing environmental conditions. 

Value for soil, water, oxygen, and ecological balance
Humans derive many benefits from the services provided by intact biological systems.  
For example, properly maintained natural hydrological cycles, such as those found in 
unaltered wetlands, stabilize water runoff.  Naturally functioning wetlands help prevent 
flooding or drought and regulate underground water tables while also filtering and puri-
fying water.  Sustaining biodiversity also aids in the formation and maintenance of soil.

counties and New York City boroughs bordering the tidal portions of the Hudson River.

Soil productivity is enhanced by the storing and recycling of nutrients through decompo-
sition and reabsorption.  Additionally, ecosystems and ecological processes are essential 
in the production of oxygen and the recycling of carbon as well as the absorption and 
decomposition of some pollutants in both air and water.

Services are not only a function of ecological processes but also are provided by species.  
Breeding populations of predatory birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, spiders and 
insects help control insect and rodent pests in human-inhabited areas.  This natural 
biological control potentially reduces the need for and cost of controlling agricultural 
pests with chemicals.  Also, the maintenance of natural habitats supports the birds and 
insects that play a key role in crop pollination.

Value for recreation and cultural heritage
The number of people taking part in recreational activities involving biodiversity 
is growing each year.  Biodiversity in the Hudson River Valley provides residents 
and tourists alike with a great number of choices in recreational activities including 
fishing, hunting, trapping, hiking, biking, boating, camping, photography, and wildlife 
observation.  The culture, economy, and beauty of the Hudson River Valley is linked to 
the biodiversity of the region.

Spiritual value
Perhaps the greatest value in biodiversity is the least measurable.  Biodiversity helps 
fulfill the spiritual, aesthetic, and inspirational needs of people and promotes the 
emotional health of our modern society.  Poets, painters, and musicians have been 
celebrating the spiritual and aesthetic value of biodiversity in the Hudson River Valley for 
centuries.

Biodiversity also has intrinsic value, independent of what it provides humans or how it 
serves our needs and desires, and so, we are moved to treasure and protect it. 

Biodiversity Conservation Considerations
The focus of biodiversity conservation efforts should reflect regional conservation 
goals.  Biodiversity conservation initiatives that focus solely on individual elements 
such as a single species or even a small number of species can lead to inefficient and 
competing management strategies.  It is important not to fall into the trap of focusing 
all conservation efforts and energies on endangered, threatened, and rare species to the 
detriment of those that are common.  A narrow focus may leave some species unprotected 
or in jeopardy.  Some rare species today were once common and some common species 
may be at risk of becoming rare.  Effective biodiversity conservation can only be 
accomplished through coordinated efforts across spatial scales and taxonomic levels.   
The ultimate purpose of biodiversity conservation is to conserve the entire complement 
of species, habitats, and processes so that ecological function can be sustained. 

10

Elements of biodiversity exist at many spatial scales; all of which require consideration 
in a comprehensive conservation program.  At its largest spatial scale, the Hudson 
River Estuary ecosystem encompasses many smaller, distinct ecosystems.  Each nested 
ecosystem is a complex, interacting collection of biodiversity elements and includes all 
living and non-living components.

Ecological communities are a primary component in the structure of an ecosystem.  
Ecological communities are uniquely defined by the plants and animals that compose 
them and are closely related to soil type, elevation, and other abiotic factors.  A mosaic 
of communities make up the Hudson River Estuary ecosystem, some of which are rare 
or otherwise exemplary (see Reschke 1990).  A community is home to many species of 
plants and animals.  Protecting one community can protect hundreds of species.

A basic, fundamental level and measure of biodiversity is species diversity and includes 
populations of all species of living organisms.  Total species conservation is an inherent 
goal of biodiversity conservation.  Species may be grouped by category indicating their 
particular contribution to biodiversity and human use.  Among these are both vulnerable 
(rare, threatened, endangered, and species of special concern) and common species, 
reflecting their relative abundance in the ecosystem.  As defined here, vulnerable species 
include those that are recognized by the federal or state government as being rare (i.e., 
federal- or state-listed) as well as those species that may not be federally or state-listed, 
but are rare in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  In addition to vulnerable species, 
there are some categories of species that may require specific attention.  Economically 
significant species are those species that have an effect on local and/or regional 
economies.  Generally thought of as species that are fished, hunted, trapped, and observed 
recreationally, these also include pest species.  Regionally significant species are those 
deemed important due to their aesthetic, cultural, or social value to local communities.

Critical to species diversity and species conservation is habitat conservation.  Simply 
stated, habitat is where a wildlife population naturally occurs and obtains support for 
living (i.e., food, cover, water).  Plant and animal species are dependent on their habitat 
for survival and reproduction, and therefore, the conservation of enough suitable habitat 
is critical for the effective conservation of overall biodiversity.  Setting aside land for 
habitat is not enough however, if the ecological processes that sustain that habitat are not 
maintained.

Community Involvement
Biodiversity exists at several scales and comprehensive conservation requires that 
multiple scales be included.  There is no inappropriate scale for conservation.  Ultimately, 
state and federal agencies can provide only a part of the total effort needed to ensure that 
regional project goals will be achieved.  Private lands constitute 90% of the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor.  Therefore, it is essential to work with counties and municipal 
governments involved in land use planning as well as individual landowners.  It follows 

11

that an integral component of biodiversity conservation is an emphasis on developing 
voluntary approaches and encouraging and assisting voluntary conservation efforts.  Only 
by embracing conservation at all levels through the involvement and cooperation of local 
communities and landowners will conservation of the Hudson River Estuary ecosystem 
be successful.  If we are to be successful in achieving our goals, it is imperative that 
people have access to the information necessary to carry out conservation in their local 
communities.

Partnerships
One of the primary objectives of this report is to create a framework for the coordination 
of conservation activities and the development of conservation partnerships.  It is 
generally understood that the future of successful conservation lies in our ability to 
form effective partnerships.  Pressures and demands on biodiversity are continually 
growing and biodiversity is increasingly jeopardized.  Even with the dedication of the 
many individuals and public and private conservation organizations in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor, the challenges are too great if each acts independently.  Experience has 
demonstrated that dedicated individuals and organizations working together cooperatively 
for a common cause can make tremendous accomplishments.  Conservation must 
therefore be a cooperative effort.

There are numerous individuals and organizations involved with biodiversity 
conservation in the Hudson River Estuary corridor (Appendix I) and conservation 
partnerships can occur at many levels among several potential partners.  Potential 
partners include, but are not limited to:

Land Trusts
Environmental Organizations

Soil and Water Conservation Districts
Environmental Management Councils

	 Non-profit Organizations
 
 
	 Federal Agencies
	 State Agencies
	 County Agencies
 
 
	 Local Government Agencies

Threats to Biodiversity in the Hudson River Estuary Corridor
There are numerous important issues facing biodiversity and biodiversity conservation 
efforts in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  The following are some of the main factors 
affecting biodiversity and biodiversity conservation across the region.  Program areas and 
specific strategies for addressing these threats are presented in Part III.

  Habitat Change and Fragmentation 

The Hudson River Valley landscape is continually changing as a result of natural and 
human processes.  Habitat change is occurring throughout New York State, including 
within the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  In particular, the state is becoming 
more forested as agricultural land uses diminish.  Early-successional habitats 
and the species that rely upon these habitats are in decline.  The Hudson River 
Estuary corridor is one of the fastest growing regions of New York State in terms of 
population and urbanization.  As a result, there is considerable clearing of natural 
areas that leads to habitat fragmentation.  Additionally, small-scale losses of wetlands, 
and in particular vernal pools, continues to be a threat to biodiversity.

Habitat fragmentation is the breaking up of contiguous areas of habitat into smaller, 
less connected pieces.  When already small parcels of land are further fragmented 
by development, they might become too small to support the complex interactions 
required to maintain an ecosystem. Fragmentation can be detrimental to area-sensitive 
species and advantageous to invasive or generalist species.  Forest interior birds and 
wide-ranging mammals that require large, unbroken tracts of habitat are particularly 
vulnerable.  Patterns of land use development can significantly affect biodiversity.  
As the region continues to develop, land-use management that considers biodiversity 
conservation should be encouraged.  For example, decisions made by local planning 
boards on how a subdivision is laid out can have a substantial negative or positive 
effect on biological resources.

 

Invasive and Overabundant Species 
Invasive native and exotic plant and animal species pose a serious threat to 
biodiversity in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Generally, invasive and exotic 
species pose a threat to biodiversity by out-competing and displacing native species 
and altering ecosystems.  The Hudson River Valley is particularly vulnerable to 
invasion of exotic plants and animals because it is a passageway for commercial 
goods from other countries as well as other parts of the United States.  These invasive 
species often come as stowaways on foreign vessels.  Invasive exotic plants are 
capable of driving out other native plant species in an area and may have reduced 
value to wildlife in terms of cover, nesting substrate, or as a food source.  Invasive 
native plant and animal species often indicate a disruption in the processes that 
typically hold native populations in balance. 

The more than 100 invasive plant species in the Hudson Estuary corridor include the 
exotic purple loosestrife (scientific names of species mentioned throughout this report 

13

are provided in Appendix II) and common reed that have overrun wetlands across the 
region choking out native wetland plants and possibly harming wildlife populations.  
Examples of invasive animal species include the exotic European starling, mute 
swan, and zebra mussel, and the native brown-headed cowbird.  Invasive, exotic 
species are a significant threat to our forests, for example, in the Hudson River Valley 
the hemlock woolly adelgid is moving northward, beech bark disease is moving 
southward, and the Asian longhorned beetle is threatening sugar maple in New York 
City and on Long Island.

Similarly, overabundant native species can lead to direct and indirect displacement 
of other species.  For example, white tailed deer can have a tremendous influence on 
the distribution and abundance of plant species which in turn affect populations of 
other species, ultimately affecting overall biodiversity in the area.  Lastly, changes 
in the landscape have caused some animals such as raccoons and skunks to increase 
in abundance, particularly in urban and suburban areas.  Large population increases 
of these generalists are not only a nuisance to homeowners, but can also result in 
local reductions in biodiversity as they prey on the eggs and juveniles of many other 
species.

  Pollution (Air, Water, Soil Quality) 

Air, water, and soil quality profoundly influence biodiversity.  Pollution has many 
sources and impacts biodiversity in a variety of ways.  Air pollutants can lead to 
soil and water pollution through atmospheric fallout (e.g. rain, snow), which can 
alter soil and water pH, and ultimately habitats and species.  Lichens are extremely 
sensitive to air quality and are unable to live where the air is polluted.  Increasingly, 
non-point source pollution from pesticides and fertilizers carried as water runoff from 
lawns, agricultural lands, and roads have a negative effect on biodiversity.  There 
is also evidence that pollution can work its way into the food chain as chemical 
contaminants (e.g., PCBs, pesticides, and heavy metals) in fish and amphibians and 
ultimately the reptiles, birds, and mammals that prey on them.  In the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor, pollutants of concern include heavy metals, organochlorines such as 
pesticides, urban runoff, acid rain, endocrine distuptors, and industrial pollutants such 
as PCBs.

  Management Conflicts on Public Lands

State and other public lands in the Hudson River Estuary corridor contain significant 
habitats that are vital to the biodiversity of the region and need to be managed in a 
manner that directs recreational uses away from ecologically sensitive areas.  

Tourists and residents of the Hudson River Valley take part in numerous recreational 
activities.  Commonly, the demand and timing of recreational pursuits exceeds the 
availability of natural areas for these activities.  As a result, tremendous pressures 
are placed on open space and natural areas, putting a growing stress on biodiversity.  
Because recreational activities have the potential to negatively affect biodiversity, 

14

there are times when recreational use of an area may need to be limited in order 
to protect biodiversity.  Conserving additional open space and providing directed 
opportunities for recreation that consider biodiversity conservation are actions needed 
to ease this pressure.  A great part of the value of biodiversity lies in what it offers 
to us as a source of recreation, learning, enjoyment, and inspiration.  The challenge 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor is to balance the need for conservation and the 
demand for access and recreation. 

  Lack of Scientific Knowledge of Biodiversity

In spite of ongoing, targeted inventory programs, we still lack important knowledge 
about the abundance and distribution of important elements of biodiversity.  We know 
perhaps even less about how these elements interact to form ecosystem functions.  It 
is necessary to recognize that in some cases, not enough information is available.  It is 
important to collect baseline information on the biodiversity of the region in order to 
assess changes over time and evaluate success in meeting conservation objectives.

We need to identify those areas where our knowledge is limited and make a 
commitment to filling in the gaps.  We are limited in our knowledge of the 
invertebrates, microorganisms, and fungi that account for the majority of species 
diversity in the region.  We are also limited in our knowledge of how to best conserve 
the entire range of biodiversity.  For example, what we have learned about conserving 
organisms such as vertebrates and vascular plants may not be appropriate for 
invertebrates or microorganisms. 

The Hudson River Valley has been studied extensively.  However, tremendous 
amounts of data from these studies are largely inaccessible and therefore remain 
unused.  Retrieving this information and making it accessible to researchers and the 
public alike could contribute greatly to our current understanding of biodiversity in 
the Hudson River Estuary corridor.

  Lack of Public Awareness and Understanding

Humans have been and continue to be the principle determinant of the present and 
future viability of much of the biodiversity in the Hudson River Valley.  Commonly, 
people are unaware of how their everyday decisions affect biodiversity.  It is vital 
that we are adequately informed about both the costs and benefits of our actions on 
elements of biodiversity.  Educating the public and providing the means to make 
informed decisions will help in the effort to conserve biodiversity.  Many people in 
the Hudson River Valley have a deep concern for the environment and want to do 
more for conservation, but do not know how.

PART II: Significant Habitats of the Hudson River Valley

Introduction
The Hudson River Estuary corridor contains a rich diversity of habitats, ranging from 
the highly productive estuarine and coastal habitats and their beaches, mudflats, marshes, 
swamps, and tributaries; to the mountainous forests of the Highlands, Catskills, Taconics, 
and Shawangunks.   In addition, the Estuary corridor contains exceptional features in-
cluding the Albany Pine Bush, Shawangunk grasslands, cave complexes, large freshwater 
wetlands such as the Great Swamp, and globally rare freshwater tidal wetlands. 

This diverse assemblage of landforms, cover types, and habitats helps to sustain a multi-
tude of plant and animal species.  The lakes, ponds, and wetlands of the region provide a 
major stopover point for tens of thousands of birds migrating along the Atlantic Flyway 
and also support resident populations of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.   The re-
maining unfragmented forests of the Catskills, Highlands, Rensselaer Plateau, and Sha-
wangunks maintain populations of migratory songbirds, black bear, bobcat, fisher, sala-
manders, snakes and other interesting animals.  In the last century, some forested habitats 
have recovered to the point that they now support species such as coyotes, ravens, fisher 
and black bear that have been gone from the Hudson River Valley since at least 1850.  
Meanwhile, farmlands and other open uplands continue to provide early stage succes-
sional habitat for populations of grassland songbirds and invertebrate species such as 
butterflies and dragonflies.

Overall, the Hudson River Estuary region is home to more than 2,000 plant and verte-
brate animal species (Smith et al. 2001; Mitchell and Tucker 1997). Additionally, there 
are numerous less glamorous, but ecologically important species of invertebrates, fungi 
and bacteria in the region.  Although few species have their entire worldwide population 
within the Hudson River Estuary corridor, a number of species have their only New York 
State occurrence within the Hudson River Estuary corridor: including the fence lizard, 
northern cricket frog, and sable clubtail dragonfly.  Other species have the majority of 
their state occurrences or their best remaining populations in the Hudson River Estuary 
corridor, including the Kentucky warbler, bog turtle, timber rattlesnake and the federally 
endangered Karner blue butterfly and Indiana bat (Finton et al. 2000). 

Terrestrial biodiversity benefits the Hudson River Estuary in important ways.  Valuable 
ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, water purification, resistance to disease and 
pest infestations, forest regeneration, and plant pollination are dependent upon biologi-
cal diversity.  Whether these processes operate near the estuary or in the highlands of 
the Hudson River Watershed, they can affect the quality of the estuary.  Upland areas are 
linked with the estuary through smaller waterways such as creeks, rivers, and ditches that 
drain the land and empty into the Hudson River.  As water flows from the uplands to the 
estuary, its chemical, physical and biological nature is modified.  As a result, the condi-
tions of these tributaries and the lands they drain directly affect the estuarine environ-
ment.

16

While some species flourish in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, others are threatened 
by habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and competition with invasive or overabun-
dant species. Approximately 150 species in the Hudson River Valley are listed by the 
NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) as threatened, endangered, 
or of special concern in New York.  A recent Gap Analysis Project (Smith et al. 2001) 
found that of the terrestrial vertebrate animals, most (272 of 308 species) have only 10% 
or less of their predicted distribution within public lands, including all of the regions am-
phibians. Twenty-three species were not predicted to occur at all on public lands.  These 
results highlight the importance of conservation efforts by both public and private land-
owners and indicate a need for prioritization of conservation efforts.

Significant Habitats and Biodiversity Areas
The entire Hudson River Estuary corridor is a significant biodiversity area within the 
context of New York State and the New England and mid-Atlantic portions of the U.S.  
Within the State of New York, it forms a regional matrix that nurtures and sustains the 
Hudson River Estuary.  Areas within the Hudson River Estuary corridor that are represen-
tative of biodiversity are shown in Figure 3.  Their unique topography, geology, hydrol-
ogy, and plant and animal communities distinguish them from neighboring areas. These 
areas contribute a fascinating variety and uniqueness to the region.  Often, they contain 
high concentrations of biological diversity or unusual ecological features that contribute 
to regional biodiversity. 

The areas shown in Figure 3 carry no regulatory designation whatsoever.  Instead, it is 
hoped that recognition of distinct areas will serve as a basis for their voluntary conserva-
tion.  Recognition of these areas can encourage coordination of conservation partnerships 
between willing stakeholders.  In addition, the identification of different biodiversity 
areas serves as a mechanism for communicating information on biodiversity to the pub-
lic.  Also, identification of significant areas supports scientific analysis of the patterns and 
processes that maintain biodiversity at a regional scale.

Biologists analyzed existing data to determine the general locations of significant biodi-
versity areas within the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  The areas were then inventoried 
and further refined following two years of field study (Howard et al. 2002).  Information 
used to identify biodiversity areas was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(USFWS 1997), New York Natural Heritage Program (Finton et al. 1999, Finton et al. 
2000, Howard et al. 2002), the National Audubon Society of New York State (1998), and 
the New York Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at Cornell University (Smith 
et al. 2001). 

These significant biodiversity areas tend to contain uncommon and ancient geologic 
features, large wetland complexes, unfragmented forests, or sharp changes in elevation.  
It is important to note that lowland landscapes, whether rural or urban, are as important 
to the health of the Estuary as mountainous settings.  The biodiversity areas range in size 
from 360 to 361,000 acres.  However, over half of the areas are larger than 25,000 acres.

The highest richness of biodiversity elements occurs in the Highlands West, Shawangunk 
Ridge, and the Hudson River Estuary in relation to other biodiversity areas their own 
size (Howard et al. 2002).  There are two likely reasons for these areas to rank higher in 
biodiversity.  One is that the overall biodiversity is actually higher within the area com-
pared to the other areas.  The other reason is that these areas have been more intensively 
sampled than the others.  Almost certainly both of these factors play a role.  Biodiversity 
element occurrences tracked by the NY Natural Heritage Program in Hudson River Estu-
ary corridor and significant biodiversity areas are shown in Figure 4.  The NY Natural 
Heritage Program tracks the distribution and health of viable populations of rare species 
and significant ecological communities.

The significant biodiversity areas tend to be large in size, but they by no means contain 
all of the important wildlife, habitat, and ecological elements important to the Hudson 
River Estuary ecosystem.  Significant habitats, some of which are profiled later in this 
section, may be found throughout the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Ecological pro-
cesses such as water and nutrient cycling, pollination, and habitat renewal necessary for 
the maintenance of biodiversity and environmental quality operate throughout the Estu-
ary corridor.  Residents of the Hudson River Valley are invited to identify the biological 
features that make their local area unique and that support environmental quality.  The 
strategy of identifying large areas important to biodiversity must be complimented by 
local approaches that identify landscape configurations that support biodiversity over the 
long-term, especially as these landscapes develop and become more populated.  Ad-
dressing the habitat requirements of common species that are affected by urban sprawl 
will prevent these species from becoming rare and in need of legislative protection in the 
future.  Significant biodiversity areas are integral parts of landscapes that support stable 
populations of species and can serve as core habitat areas.

The following sections highlight some of the habitats, species, and significant biodiver-
sity areas that are found in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  First, a general description 
of the entire Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern is provided.  This is fol-
lowed by information on the contribution of parks and preserves to biodiversity conserva-
tion within the area of biological concern.  Then, examples and descriptions are provided 
for the following significant habitat types: cliff and cave habitats, coastal habitats, open 
uplands and barrens, tributaries and riparian habitat, unfragmented forest and habitat cor-
ridors, and wetlands.  The descriptions do not provide exhaustive information about the 
habitats, but they give the reader a general understanding of their ecological importance 
and offer strategies for their conservation.  Additional information on the ecological com-
munities described in this section can be found in Reschke (1990) and Kiviat and Stevens 
(2001).  The habitat descriptions are followed by information on 22 significant biodiver-
sity areas within the Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern.  Both significant 
habitats and significant biodiversity areas are presented in alphabetical order.  Informa-
tion on specific threats to biodiversity and appropriate conservation strategies is provided 
in Part III of this document.

Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern

Site Description:
The Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern is a region of biological and 
geological diversity, and has a long and rich human history.  A dynamic geologic past has 
contributed to a great diversity of landscapes, habitats, natural communities, and species.  
This stunning history includes the workings of continental glaciers, dunes formed when 
wind carried sand from drained glacial lakes, the movements of great rivers that have 
eroded mountains, the cliffs that have resisted erosion for eons while softer materials 
crumbled, and the formation of a mountain chain the size of the Himalayas 450 million 
years ago in what is now eastern New York. 

The unique geologic setting of the 
Hudson River Valley is one the rea-
sons the region is so biologically di-
verse.  Although only 13.5% of New 
Yorks land area, the counties border-
ing the estuary from New York City 
to the Troy dam are home to approxi-
mately 86% of the different varieties 
of terrestrial vertebrate animals that 
occur in New York State (Smith et al. 
2001).  The Hudson River Estuary 
corridor is nationally and globally important for the occurrence of turtles and dragonflies 
in particular.  Residents of the Hudson River Estuary corridor have benefited greatly from 
the rich biological abundance and clean water this region produces.  Many local econo-
mies are dependent upon biodiversity, from pollination of important food crops and the 
production of timber, to recreational opportunities such as boating, fishing and hiking.  
Increasingly, biodiversity is recognized as a critical component of human and environ-
mental health.

The 150-mile stretch of the Hudson River from the federal lock and dam in Troy to the 
ocean is tidal and thus defined as an estuary.  An estuary includes the entire portion of 
a river that shows daily influence of ocean tides, and the associated wetlands along the 
rivers edge.  There are approximately 60 tributaries of the Hudson River Estuary that 
transport nutrients, pollutants, organisms, dissolved minerals, and organic and inorganic 
suspended materials into the Hudson Rivers main channel.  Because the tributaries 
drain water from the land to the Hudson River, the environmental health of the estuary is 
closely linked to the condition of tributary watersheds.  Some of the Hudson River Estu-
arys fisheries are negatively impacted by such factors as urban/suburban development, 
clearing of riparian forests for agricultural and other uses, barriers to fish passage, and 
contamination by industrial chemicals and pathogens that occur within tributary water-
sheds.  Yet other tributaries in the Hudson River Estuary Watershed provide world-class 
coldwater fisheries and high quality drinking water.  Many wildlife species depend upon 
tributaries and associated riparian areas for all or a part of their life cycles. 

21

Land ownership in the Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern is classified as 
mostly private (approximately 89%) while most of the remaining lands are managed by 
the State (approximately 10%) (Smith et al. 2001).  The Hudson River Estuary Area of 
Biological Concern can be described as predominately forest/woodland (approximately 
77%), with important components of crop and pasture lands, urban and suburban areas, 
and water.  Vegetation along the estuarys shores in undeveloped areas is deciduous for-
est, which includes oak, maple, beech, birch, hemlock, white pine and other trees.  Dry 
rocky slopes, such as the Palisades Ridge and Highlands, support red oak and chestnut 
oak.  Areas with deeper soils, generally located in the mid to upper reaches of the estu-
ary, as well as moist ravines downriver, support oak, sugar maple, tulip tree, black birch, 
beech, hemlock and flowering dogwood.  Major changes in the species composition of 
hardwood forests have occurred and continue to occur.  American chestnut and Ameri-
can elm were lost to fungal diseases of European origin, while other species expanded, 
including red maple and invasive woody species such as black locust and Norway maple.  
More recently, beech bark disease (beech blight), caused by another introduced fungus, 
has dramatically affected American beech in the Catskills, and an introduced insect, the 
hemlock woolly adelgid, is attacking hemlock, especially in the southern region of the 
Hudson River Valley.

The Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern is one of the most densely popu-
lated areas of the country and is one of the states primary industrial centers.  Thus, open 
spaces are rapidly declining and large unbroken expanses of forest and wetland are be-
coming fragmented.  The heavily populated corridor between Albany and New York City, 
bordering the Hudson River Estuary, includes more than 50% of New Yorks population 
within a land area only 13.5% of the total state land area.  There is no significant area 
of the Hudson River Valley that has not been affected in some way by human activities, 
though the scale and intensity of those activities have varied over time and space.  During 
the 20th century, the common pattern of landscape change in New York State and in most 
of the Northeast has been one of increasing forested acreage and urbanization following a 
decline in agricultural activities.  In 1880, nearly 80% of the state land area was in farms.  
In the wake of clearing for agriculture, grassland species moved into the state and may 
still be more common today than they were in pre-settlement times.  

Much of the information above can be found in reports on the Hudson River Valley Gap 
Analysis Project (Smith et al. 2001),  New York Natural Heritage Program inventory 
results (Howard et al. 2002), and the Hudson River Estuary Action Agenda 2005-2009.

Ecological Significance:
The biodiversity of the Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern is greater than 
can be expected by chance alone for a land area of similar size within the State of New 
York.  This diversity can be attributed to many factors, including the range in elevation 
from lowlands to high peaks, a diversity of soils and bedrock geology, and gradients of 
fresh to salt water.

Among terrestrial vertebrates, 85% (28 species) of New Yorks total amphibian species, 
73% (27 species) of New Yorks total reptile species, 87% (199 species) of New Yorks 
total breeding bird species, and 92% (54 species) of New Yorks total mammal spe-
cies can be found in the Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological Concern (Smith et al. 
2001).  The Hudson River Estuary corridor offers opportunities found nowhere else in the 
state for conservation of amphibian and reptile biodiversity.  In the case of turtles, a 200 
million year old group of reptiles, the Hudson River and its tributaries is one of the most 
important river systems in the world.  The number of turtle species found in the Hudson 
River Valley is matched only by the Suawanee River (Florida), the Mekong River (south-
east Asia), and the Irrawaddy River (Myanmar).

23

Among vegetative communities, the Hudson River Estuary corridor has proportionally 
more Sugar Maple-Mesic Forest, Oak Forest, and Appalachian Oak-Pine Forest than 
found elsewhere in New York State, embedded predominately in an urban/suburban ma-
trix.

Grassland habitats of the Hudson River Estuary corridor support several rare or declining 
bird species, including Henslows sparrow, vesper and savannah sparrows, sedge wren, 
northern harrier, meadowlark, and bobolink.  Wetlands and coastal areas greatly contrib-
ute to the diversity of birds found in the region.  Tidal wetlands along the estuary support 
egrets, least bittern, American bittern, black rail, osprey and many species of waterfowl.  
Wooded swamps support breeding red-shouldered hawks and concentrations of migrat-
ing warblers.  Other notable bird habitats in the Hudson River Estuary Area of Biological 
Concern include the westernmost section of Long Island Sound (the Narrows) and the 
north shore bays of this area, marshes associated with bays, sand beaches, and the Arthur 
Kill area of the lower estuary.

Large wetlands scattered across Dutchess, Putnam, Ulster, and Orange counties support 
the highest diversity of turtles in New York State.  These counties contain concentrations 
of important turtle habitats such as floodplain forest, dwarf shrub bogs, shrub swamps 
and calcareous fens.  Six turtle species found in the Hudson River Estuary corridor (other 
than sea turtles) are state-listed as endangered, threatened and special concern species 
including the bog turtle, Blandings turtle, eastern mud turtle, spotted turtle, wood turtle, 
and eastern box turtle.  Numerous areas throughout the Hudson River Estuary Area of 
Biological Concern have been documented as containing crucial habitat for salamanders 
and frogs, including the northern cricket frog, blue spotted salamander, marbled salaman-
der, four-toed salamander, spotted salamander, Jefferson salamander, and longtail sala-
mander.

Hudson River tributaries and their area of confluence with the main stem provide impor-
tant habitat for migratory fishes, including striped bass, American shad, rainbow smelt, 
alewife, and blueback herring, as well as resident species, such as white sucker, yellow 
perch, spottail shiner, white perch, and smallmouth bass.  Tributaries with largely intact 
natural processes have food webs that support diverse plant and animal life.  These sys-
tems convert carbon and nutrients into biodiversity rather than excessive algae or nutrient 
exports, which in turn protects the estuary.  In addition, streams with intact floodplains 
soak up and store flood waters, while replenishing ground water, filtering nutrients and 
chemicals, depositing sediments onto floodplains, and limiting erosion.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
While tens of thousand of acres, and numerous species and natural communities are 
protected by state, local and private landowners, the full range of diversity in the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor has no legal or management protection.  As a result, the voluntary 
management of private lands for biodiversity, and improved management of public lands, 
will largely determine the success of biodiversity conservation.  Key conservation issues 
facing private and public land managers within the region include:

24

  Loss and fragmentation of habitats, particularly those with high ecological signifi-

cance;

  Loss of old ecosystems such as mature forests or wetlands with deep organic soil;
  Maintaining the natural cycles and processes that support biodiversity (such as pred-

ator-prey relationships, hydrologic regimes, land-forming processes, climate regimes, 
fire regimes, and many kinds of natural disturbance);

  Maintenance of habitat connectivity across the landscape;
  Maintenance of the composition and structure of habitats within natural ranges (re-
placement of native species by non-native invasive species is a particular concern); 
and

  Pollution and disruption of habitats that threatens wildlife and human health.

Many of the measures necessary for biodiversity conservation can be addressed by 
individual landowners, either on their own property or through representation by local 
governments.   Biodiversity protection can be fostered in many small ways, but to stem 
the ultimate loss of species and habitats in the Hudson River Valley, biodiversity concerns 
need to be considered in land use planning and land stewardship.  The following planning 
and stewardship measures are recommended for consideration and application where ap-
propriate (Kiviat and Stevens 2001):

  Protect large, contiguous, unaltered tracts wherever possible;
  Preserve links between natural habitats on adjacent properties;
  Preserve natural disturbance processes such as fires, floods, tidal flushing, seasonal 

drawdowns, and wind exposure, wherever possible;

  Restore and maintain broad buffer zones of natural vegetation along streams, along 
the shores of other water bodies and wetlands, and at the perimeter of other sensitive 
habitats;
In general, encourage development of altered land instead of unaltered land wherever 
possible;

 

  Promote redevelopment of brownfields, other post-industrial sites, and other previ-

ously altered sites, instead of breaking new ground in unaltered areas;

  Encourage pedestrian-centered developments that enhance existing neighborhoods, 

instead of isolated developments requiring new roads or expanded vehicle use;

  Concentrate development along existing roads and discourage construction of new 

roads in undeveloped areas.  Promote clustered development wherever appropriate, to 
maximize extent of unaltered land;

  Direct human uses toward the least sensitive areas, and minimize alteration of natural 

features, including vegetation, soils, bedrock, and waterways;

  Preserve farmland potential wherever possible;
  Minimize area of impervious surfaces (roads, parking lots, sidewalks, driveways, roof 

surface) and maximize onsite runoff retention and infiltration to help protect ground-
water recharge, and surface water quality and flows; and

  Restore degraded habitats wherever possible, but avoid destruction of existing intact 

habitats.

Parks and Preserves

Description:
The Hudson River Estuary corridor contains an abundance of parks and preserves (Fig-
ure 5).  Parks and preserves are protected lands that often have multiple (and sometimes 
restricted) uses associated with them.  Because of their protected status, these lands offer 
unique opportunities to conserve biodiversity.  They include state parks, wildlife manage-
ment areas, state forests, state reforestation areas, county parks, town and city parks, as 
well as private conservation lands.  The Nature Conservancy, the Open Space Institute, 
the Audubon Society, and local land trusts are private groups that own conservation lands 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, some of which are open to the public. 

State and federal lands comprise about 10% of the Hudson River Estuary corridor, with 
less than 1% under federal and 9.6% under state stewardship authority (Smith et al. 
2001).  Federal lands are clustered in the southern third of the Estuary corridor with the 
largest contiguous block managed by the Department of Defense (West Point Military 
Reservation).  State government agency lands are generally well distributed, but large 
clusters do occur in the Catskill Mountains in the western portion of the Estuary corridor, 
and the Highlands and Mohawk/Black River Valley in the south.  The Hudson River Es-
tuary corridor is about 77% forested and nearly 12% of these forests are managed by state 
agencies, while 87% are privately managed (Smith et al. 2001). 

Substantial responsibility for biodiversity conservation on public lands within the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor lies with the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation 
(DEC) and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation 
(OPRHP).  These two organizations manage approximately 85% of the total public land 
area.  The distribution of public land stewardship in the Hudson River Estuary corridor is 
as follows:

The lands offering the greatest protection of biodiversity have a documented long-term 
intent, or preferably a written management plan or legal mandate to ensure long term 
protection of the existing natural habitat.  Land stewardship units were assigned to major 
categories of biodiversity protection for the Hudson River Valley Gap Analysis Project 
(Smith et al. 2001).  Land stewardship units are listed under their various levels of protec-
tion, which are roughly described in Table 2.

Table 2.  Examples of biodiversity stewardship on conservation lands in the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor (Smith et al. 2001). For the Hudson River Valley Gap Analysis, 
each individual land unit was classified by level of stewardship. Some conservation lands 
appear in more than one category, because individual land units under the same agency 
were managed differently.

Ecological Importance:
The ecological importance of parks and preserves relates in part to their protected status.  
However, parks and preserves afford widely differing levels of protection of biodiversity.  

The Gap Analysis Project (Smith et al. 2001) mapped the proportion of land cover types 
under different levels of biodiversity protection.  Four forest types accounted for 90% 
of the land cover in permanent protection: Sugar-Maple Mesic, Evergreen-Northern 
Hardwood, Oak, and Spruce Fir.  Eighty-eight percent of vertebrate species native to the 
Hudson River Estuary corridor had less than 10% of their predicted habitat in permanent 
protection.  Nearly all (94%) of the listed or ranked species (by NYSDEC, USFWS, or 
The Nature Conservancy) have less than 10% of their predicted distribution in permanent 
protection.  The low degree of protection afforded to certain land cover types (such as 
grasslands or water related habitats) may be one reason some species can maintain only 
small populations with limited distribution in the Hudson River Estuary corridor (Smith 
et al. 2001). 

While some parks and preserves contain nationally and globally rare elements of biodi-
versity, their larger role may be to support more common ecological communities that 
are locally rare due to surrounding land uses.  For example, Van Cortlandt Park and Ward 
Pound Ridge Reservation are park lands in close proximity to New York City where some 
rare species are found and natural vegetation is mostly intact.  In a recent analysis (Miller 
and Klemens 2002), the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation was found to be a hub or large 
core area that is better able to support healthy, viable wildlife populations than smaller 
areas in eastern Westchester County.  The report identified other areas in the region that 
could act as hubs and also broad swaths of habitat (used by wildlife as migration corri-
dors) that connect the hubs.  Based on biological surveys completed within a three-town 
area, the project identified a biodiversity corridor (Figure 6) that complements preserva-
tion of the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation and recommended that the lands be kept in a 
relatively unfragmented state.

Conservation Strategies:
Conservation strategies for parks and preserves should address maintaining habitats and 
ecological communities in their natural state.  Where appropriate, habitat restoration can 
be considered.  Potential threats to biodiversity (e.g., invasive and overabundant species, 
potential impacts from permitted land uses) should be evaluated and addressed.   

29

Opportunities to educate the public about biodiversity conservation can be encouraged on 
these lands through a variety of mechanisms such as interpretive trails, field walks led by 
naturalists, and educational pamphlets and brochures. The New York State Open Space 
Plan (draft 2005) suggests that both public land acquisition and private land conserva-
tion strategies are necessary to achieve adequate biodiversity protection.  Guidelines for 
acquisition or private conservation should consider the need to buffer parks and protect 
their ecological communities by strategically acquiring adjacent land or limiting degrad-
ing land uses around the park.

Significant Habitat Descriptions:

31

Cave & Cliff Habitats

 

 
Description:
Caves: Caves in the Hudson River Valley include natural rock formations as well as 
abandoned mines.  Both provide important roosting and wintering habitat for a number of 
bat species.  Ice cave talus communities with unique plant communities also exist on the 
Shawangunk Ridge.  

Cliffs:  Cliff communities occur on vertical 
exposures of resistant rock with minimal soil 
development and vegetation.  Cliffs have 
shallow, droughty soils, are exposed to the 
brunt of winter and summer weather, and 
generally are difficult places for plants to 
grow.  These communities range from bare 
rock, to lichen or moss-covered rock, to 
grass or forb dominance, to (occasionally) 
shrub thickets, to tree groves or forest.   
Bedrock types that predominate along the 
Hudson River Estuary include diabase, granite, gneiss, schist, quartzite, sandstone, slate, 
and shale, approximately in order from harder to softer rocks.  Cliff communities are 
also found on rocky hills or ridges underlain by carbonate rock: limestone, marble, and 
similar types of rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate.

The trees growing on cliffs are generally stunted and many dead or damaged trees are 
often present.  Among the most typical trees on harder bedrock are red oak, chestnut oak, 
red maple, and pitch pine.  Typical trees on softer bedrock are basswood, sugar maple, 
white ash, hackberry, chestnut oak, and American beech.  Crevice-using animals (e.g., 
winter wren, porcupine, small mammals, several species of snakes) are associated with 
cliff communities.

Ecological Importance:
Caves: Caves in the Hudson River Estuary corridor are critical for a number of bat 
species, including several that are rare.  Bats use these caves as winter hibernacula 
because temperatures remain stable.  Characteristic bats that use caves include little 
brown bat, Keens bat, big brown bat, and eastern pipistrelle.  Rare species include the 
eastern small-footed bat and the federally endangered Indiana bat, which hibernates in 
limestone caves.  The Hudson River Estuary corridor is an especially important area 
for rare bats in New York State, because it contains approximately 40% of the state 
occurrences of the eastern small-footed bat and three of the eight Indiana bat hibernacula 
in the state (Finton et al. 2000).

Ice cave talus communities occur on rock and soil at the base of talus slopes and 
emit cold air where winter ice remains throughout the summer.  The vegetation in the 
immediate area is distinctive because it includes species that occur in much cooler   

32

climates (e.g., black spruce, hemlock, mountain ash, creeping snowberry).  Some rare 
bryophytes have also been found in these communities.  Other characteristic wildlife 
includes timber rattlesnake and certain small mammals (Reschke 1990).

Cliffs:	 Because of their unique geology, cliffs are important for a number of plant and 
animal species.  Rare plants that may occur in cliff communities include mountain 
spleenwort, prickly pear, purple cliffbrake, and three-toothed cinquefoil.  Cliff areas 
provide overwintering habitat for a number of snakes.  Cliffs and crests constitute many 
of the important pathways for migrating hawks.  The common raven and peregrine falcon 
nest on cliffs.  A characteristic invertebrate of shale cliffs is the silvery blue butterfly.  
West of the Hudson River the falcate orange tip butterfly occurs where rock-cresses are 
abundant.  An extremely rare earthstar fungus, Geastrum pectinatus, has been found on a 
limestone boulder within the Hudson River Estuary corridor (Kiviat and Stevens 2001). 

Conservation Strategies:
Caves: Because of their critical importance as bat hibernacula, inventories of caves in the 
Hudson River Valley should be continued.  All carbonate formations should be inspected 
for caves.  If a cave is located, assistance from an amateur or professional cave specialist 
should be sought.  Cave entrances can be dangerous.  Appropriate conservation measures 
should be taken to protect these communities from land-use practices that would threaten 
their long-term viability.  A buffer is needed around the mouths of caves in order to 
support the species that use them, particularly bats.  Mining activities close to cave 
habitats can cause physical disturbances that disrupt bat communities.  Spelunking can 
also be disruptive, and should be discouraged in caves known to be used by bats.

Cliffs:  Cliff communities in the Hudson River Valley can be negatively impacted by 
disturbances associated with clearing, heavy pedestrian use, and soil damage by off-
road vehicles.  All of these activities lead to invasion by weedy introduced plants.  
Additionally, Reschke (1990) points out that more data on cliff communities are 
needed.  Some of these areas are also extremely popular for rock climbing. Therefore, 
conservation strategies should address land-uses that threaten the viability of these 
communities and should include outreach, easements, and balancing recreation with 
conservation.  In some cases, restoration of damaged areas should be considered.

Coastal Habitats

Description:  
Coastal areas of the Hudson River Valley include a variety of diverse habitats.  Examples 
include sand beaches, dunes, offshore islands, rocky intertidal areas, tidal wetlands, tidal 
rivers, tidal creeks, salt marshes, mudflats, open-water coves, and coastal grasslands. 

Ecological Importance:
Coastal areas within the estuary 
corridor contain regionally sig-
nificant fish and wildlife habitat.  
Waterfowl, colonial wading birds, 
neotropical migrants, raptors, 
marine and estuarine fishes, and 
sea turtles rely upon these diverse 
habitats for foraging, nesting, and 
wintering.  Coastal habitats sup-
port many regionally rare species 
that are at the northern limits of 
their geographical range.

Conservation Strategies:
Effective conservation of coastal habitats in the 
Hudson River Estuary corridor will require a 
coordinated and collaborative effort involving 
federal, state, and local governments, private 
organizations, and coastal communities.  Because 
of the diversity of both the habitats and issues sur-
rounding their conservation, specific strategies are 
not covered here, but rather are presented within 
the descriptions of the significant biodiversity 
areas listed below.

Open Uplands & Barrens

Description:
Open uplands and barrens in the Hudson River Valley encompass a variety of ecological 
communities, including grasslands, pitch pine-scrub oak barrens, serpentine barrens, and 
rocky summit grasslands.  Many of these community types are rare and support threat-
ened, endangered, or special concern species.  In general these habitat types are dominat-
ed by non-woody plant species.   Much of the information on open uplands and barrens 
presented below is adapted from Kiviat and Stevens (2001).

	 Grasslands

Grassland habitats include a variety of ecological communities, from native grassland 
communities to successional old fields to agricultural habitats, including cropland and 
pastureland. Fields abandoned from crops, livestock grazing, mowing, or other man-
agement become covered by grasses, forbs, shrubs, saplings or root sprouts of trees.  
Oldfields often support diverse vegetation with a variety of plant species and may 
provide habitat for rare birds, plants, and butterflies.  Some grasslands in the state are 
native and were maintained historically by natural and human-induced burning.

These communities are important for a number of grassland bird species including 
the field sparrow, grasshopper sparrow, vesper sparrow, Henslows sparrow, bobolink, 
mourning dove, upland sandpiper, horned lark, and northern harrier.  Grassland com-
munities provide essential habitat for these species for breeding, nesting, foraging, 
rearing young, and roosting (Sample and Mossman 1997).
  

 

 

 

     
	 Pitch pine-scrub oak barrens

   

This is a shrub-savanna community with pitch pine as the dominant tree.  Pitch pine 
may grow in dense thickets of small trees (dwarf pine plains), or in a more open 
canopy (as in the Albany Pine Bush).  The dominant shrub layer includes scrub oak 
with a lower shrub layer composed of sweet-fern, blueberries, and black huckleberry.  
Scrub oak thickets cover 60 to 80% of the community, and contain small patches of 
grassland.  These grasslands are dominated by big bluestem, little bluestem, and In-
dian grass.  Representative forbs include bush-clovers, pinweed, milkwort, goats-rue, 
and wild lupine. 

Pitch pine-scrub oak barrens occur on deep, glacial sands (usually derived from the 
bottoms of drained glacial lakes).  The sandy soils are generally nutrient-poor and 
moderately well drained to somewhat excessively drained, creating poor growing 
conditions for most plant species.  Sand plains, more than any other habitat, are peri-
odically swept by fires, which may kill the tops of woody plants, but not the crowns 
from which new shoots rapidly grow.  Topography may be flat or hilly, the result of 
former moving dunes now stabilized by the overlying vegetation.  Barrens may con-
tain streams, wetlands, vernal pools and patches of mesophytic forests (in moist place 

37

such as stream valleys), grassland, or bare sand with only mosses and lichens. Herbs 
are few, but include species not found in other habitats. 

Characteristic fauna includes frosted elfin, the federally endangered Karner blue 
butterfly, rufous-sided towhee, common yellowthroat, field sparrow, prairie warbler, 
brown-headed cowbird, indigo bunting, brown thrasher, and whip-poor-will. 

 

 

 
	   Rocky summit grasslands

 

 

 

 

Rocky summit grasslands are found in the Highlands on rocky summits and exposed 
slopes of hills.  They occur on non-carbonate bedrock (e.g., quartzite, sandstone, 
schist) and carbonate bedrock (e.g., limestone, dolomite). Many of the community oc-
currences have originated following fires.

Characteristic flora includes little and big bluestem, common hairgrass, poverty-grass, 
and Indian grass.  Common forbs include downy and other goldenrods, bristly sarsa-
parilla, rock-cresses, and rock polypody.  Foliose and crustose lichens may be abun-
dant.  Mosses are usually present in small patches.

	   Serpentine barrens

Within New York State, this grass-savanna community is known only from Staten Is-
land.  A variety of grasses and forbs characterize the community, and trees and shrubs 
comprise approximately 20-40 and 15-30% of the flora, respectively.  The Arogos 
skipper is a characteristic butterfly of the serpentine barrens.

 
Ecological Importance:
Open upland and barrens communities provide 
habitat for a number of rare animal and plant species 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, most notably 
grassland birds, invertebrates, and timber rattlesnake.  
Grassland species, particularly grassland-breeding 
birds that expanded their range into New York fol-
lowing the extensive clearing of forests for agricul-
ture, are now declining in the state due to reforesta-

tion.  Some grassland species such as grasshopper sparrow are declining throughout their 
former range, including areas outside of New York State. 

Grassland bird species of particular interest include northern harrier, upland sandpiper, 
sedge wren, bobolink, eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, Henslows sparrow, 
and vesper sparrow.  Fields and field edges are important feeding habitats for eastern 
bluebird.  Grasslands are known to support rare plants, especially on calcareous soils.  
Rare plant species found in wetland areas of the Shawangunk grasslands include Franks 
sedge, Bushs sedge, small white aster, swamp agrimony, coontail, and pointed water-
meal.  More common species in oldfields include goldenrods, asters, Kentucky bluegrass, 
orchard grass, little bluestem, gray dogwood, multiflora rose, berries, hawthorns, stag-
horn sumac, eastern red cedar, gray birch, red maple, black locust, oaks, quaking aspen 

38

and white pine.  Dry oldfields may support any of several rare butterflies, including the 
Aphrodite fritillary.

Rocky grasslands provide habitat for the threatened timber rattlesnake.  Other reptiles and 
amphibians that  may use these habitats include northern copperhead, eastern hognose 

snake, black rat snake, worm snake, east-
ern fence lizard, five-lined skink, eastern 
box turtle, slimy salamander, and marbled 
salamander.  Rocky summits are important 
for rare and uncommon mammals, such 
as bobcat, fisher, porcupine, and boreal 
redback vole.

Sand plain communities are in them-
selves rare and specialized.  The deep, 
sandy soils support greater biodiversity

of non-woody plants and other groups of 
organisms.  Herbs such as wild lupine, sandspur, purple boneset, eyebane, stiff gentian, 
dotted horsemint and blunt-leaf milkweed do not occur naturally on rock substrates.  In 
the Northeast, buck moth, which in the larval stage feeds on leaves of scrub oak, occurs 
almost exclusively in sand barrens and rarely in rocky barrens.  Over 300 species of ver-
tebrates, over 1,500 species of plants, and over 10,000 species of invertebrates have been 
reported from the Albany sand plains area (Kiviat and Stevens 2001).  

Conservation Strategies:
One threat to these areas in the Hudson River Valley is the conversion of these open 
canopy habitats into closed canopy forest that do not support the typical plant and animal 
species.  Additionally, invasion by exotic plant species can out-compete native species.  
Therefore, in addition to land protection, management activities aimed at maintaining 
these habitats should be implemented.  This may involve a combination of techniques 
(e.g., mowing, burning, brush hog clearing) designed to maintain a specific community 
or reduce the amount of woody vegetation.  However, the timing of these management 
techniques must be carefully considered in relation to the biology of the species that are 
present.  In some cases, habitat restoration may be warranted (e.g., serpentine barrens on 
Staten Island).

Grasslands are generally tolerant of human use.  However, areas known to support rare 
plants, rare breeding birds, or rare butterflies should be protected from human distur-
bance. Rocky summit grasslands may be protected by minimizing habitat fragmentation, 
soil erosion, and direct and indirect disturbance to wildlife from recreational, extrac-
tive, and other land uses.  Rocky summit grasslands and other grasslands are threatened 
by succession, often as a result of fire suppression. Habitats of rare species may require 
management such as infrequent mowing, selective removal of trees, or prescribed fire to 
retard development of tree cover.

39

Land protection may be implemented through a variety of methods including acquisition 
(on a voluntary, willing seller basis), conservation easements, cooperative land agree-
ments, and outreach.  Grassland bird management is an example of how land protection 
strategies may be used to benefit a variety of species.  Areas managed for grassland birds 
should be at least 250 acres in size, but preferably larger (Vickery et al. 1997).  Oppor-
tunities to provide adequate habitat for grassland bird species in the Hudson River Val-
ley may come primarily through 
cooperative land agreements 
that, collectively, meet minimum 
habitat requirements.  Sample and 
Mossman (1997) provide detailed 
recommendations for managing 
habitat for grassland birds.

Within the Hudson River Estuary 
corridor, cropland, old field/pas-
ture, and barrens comprise approx-
imately 6.5, 1.7, and 0.1% of the 
land area, respectively (Smith et 
al. 2001).  Because the majority of 
the Hudson River Valleys open uplands are considered cropland, outreach to the agricul-
tural community may be especially relevant.  Developing Best Management Practices for 
farming activities (e.g., tilling, planting, harvesting, crop and pasture rotation, pesticide 
and fertilizer use) as they relate to grassland bird conservation should be a priority.

Tributaries & Riparian Habitat

Description:
The health of the Hudson River Estuary is closely linked to the health of its tributaries 
and their watersheds. There are roughly 65 major tributaries to the Hudson River Estuary 
with over 3,600 miles of streams in the estuary watershed.  These tributaries and adjacent 
riparian areas provide important habitat for fish and wildlife.  Migratory fish, like herring 
and eel, and resident species, such as black bass, rely on tributary habitats to complete 
their life cycles.  Blue crabs use the tributaries for nursing and overwintering.  In the 
Hudson River Estuary, the mouths of tributary streams and rivers are influenced by daily 
tides, and are thus unique communities.  

Streams include channel habitat and riparian areas 
on the tops of the banks, the floodplain, and non-
floodplain areas adjoining the stream. A typical 
stream channel exhibits a sequence of microhabi-
tats in the form of pools, riffles, and runs.  Pools 
and slow runs might support submerged vegeta-
tion while channel bars and portions of low banks 
can support plants such as willows, alder, silky 
dogwood, spotted jewelweed, stinging nettle, and 
Intertidal swale. Photo courtesy of Kathryn Schneider.
whitegrass.  Streambanks and floodplains are often dominated by plants tolerant of flood-
ing and ice damage.  The floodplain is the low-lying area that is flooded by a stream at 
statistical intervals.  The 100-year floodplain for example, is predicted to be flooded once 
per century.  Floodplains contain a variety of habitats, including but not limited to upland 
meadow, wet meadows, swamps, marshes, and lowland forests.  Although once common, 
floodplain forest is now rare in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.

Riparian habitats represent only a small portion of the landscape, but are a critical source 
of biodiversity.  A riparian zone is an interface between aquatic and terrestrial systems.  
Riparian ecosystems cover the land bordering a stream, wetland, lake, tidewater, or other 
body of water.  The suitability of these zones for supporting aquatic and terrestrial plants 
and animals can be altered by agricultural and timber harvesting activities, the creation of 
physical structures such as buildings, roads, and dams and other human disturbances such 
as recreation.

Ecological Importance:
Riparian zones serve a variety of functions, including those related to physical and 
chemical characteristics of streams (e.g., moderating water temperature, controlling 
stream erosion and sedimentation, controlling non-point source pollution) and they pro-
vide habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species.  Many aquatic invertebrates, which 
are food for predatory fish, use riparian vegetation as habitat and depend upon leaves as 
a source of food.  Leaves fallen from streamside trees are the carbon source that fuels 
the entire aquatic food chain in small to medium-sized tributary streams.  Riparian trees 

42

also help to create critical habitat features, such as cover, undercut banks, and piles of 
woody debris that trap nutrients.  Even a narrow band of woody vegetation contributes 
to edge of channel habitat structure (such as undercut banks) and temporary bank sta-
bilization.  Riparian vegetation is a source of woody debris that helps to create micro-
habitat within the stream channel.  In addition to supporting the aquatic environment, 
riparian areas are unique ecosystems in themselves, and present optimal conditions 
for a number of plant and animal species.  The soils and microclimate within riparian 
areas often contain the right conditions for ferns, orchids, and other plants that prefer 
rich, moist soils and environs.

Riparian zones tend to be biodiverse, because they provide a close juxtaposition of 
wildlife habitat requirements, an increased number of niches due to increased plant 
diversity and structural heterogeneity, and high edge-to-area ratios resulting from their 
linear shape. Riparian corridors are networks that provide potential routes for animal 
movement, seed dispersal, and gene flow across landscapes, and may serve as a source 
area for recolonization of nearby disturbed areas.  Loss of mature, riparian forest 
remains an issue of concern in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.   Wildlife species 
that depend upon wide bands of mature riparian forest, riparian wetlands, and silt-free 
channel beds are the most imperiled.

Terrestrial animals utilize riparian areas 
for foraging, breeding, migration, hiber-
nation, and refuge.  Semi-aquatic mam-
mals that use tributary habitats include 
mink, muskrat, and river otter.  Bats and 
birds forage on insects above the water.  
A variety of birds use tributaries and 
riparian habitat, including waterfowl, 
woodcock, belted kingfishers, osprey, 
eagles, herons, and many songbirds. 
Streams support fish and aquatic macro-
invertebrate communities, stream salamanders, green frog, snapping turtle, eastern 
painted turtle, wood turtle, and northern water snake.  A number of invertebrates use 
these habitats, including damselflies, butterflies, and dragonflies.

Pollutants released in the watershed find their way to the estuary through tributaries.  
In the Hudson River Estuary corridor, pollutants of concern include excessive sedi-
ment and nutrients, toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and pathogens.  Other significant 
causes of water quality impairment in tributary streams include noxious aquatic plants 
(particularly at tributary mouths), thermal modification, flow alteration and other habi-
tat modifications.  Many pollutants readily attach to sediment, which in excess, is also 
considered a pollutant.  Potential pollutants such as pathogens, phosphorus, and some 
pesticides readily attach to sediments and are resuspended in the water column dur-

43

ing disturbances, or transported downstream to drinking water reservoirs or the Hudson 
River Estuary.   All stream systems naturally erode and redeposit sediments.  However, 
sediment erosion or deposition beyond natural rates can create conditions that aquatic 
organisms are unable to tolerate.  Common sources of sediment include eroding banks 
(although some bank erosion is natural), construction sites, agricultural fields, and urban 
runoff.

The obstruction of fish migration by dams and other structures, and habitat alteration re-
lated to activities such as gravel mining or reservoir water releases, can also degrade trib-
utary habitats.  Dams alter river continuum and connectivity, disrupt sediment transport, 
and alter natural fluctuation in water supply.  Increasingly, increased impervious surfaces 
are causing changes to watershed hydrology, particularly in the rapidly urbanizing por-
tions of the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Impervious surfaces such as roads, rooftops, 
and parking lots direct stormwater 
to streams as runoff, rather than 
allowing it to infiltrate the soil and 
reach the stream as groundwater.  
Because water is not stored in the 
soil and released to the stream at 
slower rates, the result is that low 
flows are more severe and last lon-
ger during summer months, while 
storm flows may peak at higher and 
more destructive levels.  Both the 
increased flow rate and amount of 
water reaching the stream can cause 
devastating changes in channel and 
riparian habitats.

Conservation Strategies:
The cumulative effects of channelization, point and nonpoint source pollution, gravel 
mining, dam construction, floodplain filling, and riparian vegetation removal throughout 
a stream system can lead to dramatic declines in biodiversity.  Best Management Prac-
tices designed to reduce these disturbances should be developed based on an understand-
ing of how disturbances affect certain species, at what intensities, and during which times 
during the species annual life-cycle.  Management of stream and riparian habitats may 
involve the establishment of buffers, limiting livestock and human access during criti-
cal time periods, and limiting certain types of activities.  Conservation easements, local 
zoning ordinances, and set-aside of riparian areas, can create a space for natural stream 
processes to operate. 

Minimizing development in the riparian corridor, and minimizing hydrologic alteration of 
the stream system within the watershed (including intermittent tributaries and wetlands) 
will help to protect stream biodiversity.  Restoration of native riparian meadows and for-

44

ests, as well as natural channel morphology is essential for the protection of water qual-
ity.  Stream managers should consider that alterations of floodplain, channel, and riparian 
habitats in one section of the stream can cause unwanted changes in downstream habitats.

Management approaches to conserving riparian zones 
must address both the loss and degradation of these habi-
tats and the effects of human disturbance.  The USDA 
Forest Service (Welsch 1991) provides specific guide-
lines for the conservation and maintenance of riparian 
zones, including recommendations for the size of forest 
buffer widths.  In general, riparian buffer widths should 
be at least 300 feet to support wildlife habitat.  However, 
conservation buffers of this size are not always possible.  
Buffers of at least 50 feet protect some streamside func-
tions, although their long-term effectiveness should be 
examined for the particular stream and the probability 
of channel adjustments.  Recommended buffer sizes can 
also be based on particular stream processes and species-
specific habitat requirements (Wenger 1999).  Riparian 
buffer recommendations should be incorporated into 
forestry and agricultural Best Management Practices and 
communicated to interested landowners.

Unfragmented Forest & Habitat Corridors

Description:
Unfragmented forests are relatively large forest or woodland tracts that are unbroken by 
major roads or other developments.  Some of the forest types found in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor include pitch pine-oak forest, Appalachian oak-hickory, chestnut oak 
forest, beech-maple mesic forest, hemlock-northern hardwood forest, spruce-northern 
hardwood forest, mountain spruce-fir forest, and mountain fir forest.  Some examples of 
large forested blocks in the Hudson Valley include the Rensselaer Plateau, the Highlands, 
and the Catskill, Taconic, and Shawangunk mountains. Lowland forest floors that have 
deep leaf litter and uncompacted soils are rare remnants of features that may once have 
covered large areas in the Hudson River Valley.

Ecological Importance:
Unfragmented forest blocks are important for a number of species sensitive to distur-
bance and dependent on large areas to meet their habitat requirements.  These species are 
typically defined as interior or area-sensitive species and include several large mammals 
(e.g., bobcat, black bear, fisher), raptors (e.g., red-shouldered hawk, Coopers hawk), and 
songbirds (e.g, woodland warblers, forest thrushes).  Furthermore, some species de-
pend on the clean, cold water provided in headwater streams in forested regions.  These 
streams are critical habitat for trout as well as several species of amphibians.

Habitat corridors that link intact forest blocks are ex-
tremely important features in the landscape.  Corridors 
are habitat for dispersing animals, and most importantly 
connect species populations.  In many cases these corri-
dors represent riparian habitat as well.

Although few examples of old-growth lowland forest 
remain, forests of moderate-sized and moderate-aged 
trees continue to provide valuable habitat and might 
provide valuable mature forest habitat in the future.  
Typical trees in a lowland forest include sugar maple, 
oaks (black, red, chestnut, white), American beech, and 
hemlock.  Other trees that may be present include shag-
bark hickory, white ash, basswood, tulip tree, and black 
birch.  Characteristic animals of unfragmented forests 
are red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, pileated wood-

pecker, ovenbird, wood thrush, cerulean warbler, and Acadian flycatcher.  A diverse small 
mammal community and invertebrate community are usually also present.   Rare fungi, 
lichens and bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) are associated with remaining lowland 
old-growth forests. The red-shouldered hawk may be rare in part due to fragmentation of 
this habitat.

47

Conservation Strategies:
Habitat change and fragmentation are substantial pressures negatively affecting biological 
diversity in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Floodplain forest and mesic lowlands are 
especially at risk of fragmentation, and are under-repre-
sented on public lands (A. Finton, NY Natural Heritage 
Program, pers. comm.).  Therefore, it should be stressed 
that intact, forested habitats should be conserved regard-
less of size.  Within fragmented landscapes, the conser-
vation of habitat corridors that link intact forest blocks 
is of particular importance. On a local level, this will 
involve the identification of forest blocks and corridors.  
Once identified, conservation tools aimed at protecting 
these areas (e.g., conservation easements, acquisition on 
a willing seller basis) should be implemented. Forestry 
plans for these areas should emphasize selective and low-
impact harvesting, particularly of mature lowland forest.  
Forest management practices that reduce the impact of 
roads and compaction and disturbance by vehicles should 
be encouraged.

On a regional level, strategies to address habitat change and fragmentation should focus 
initially on identifying those lands most at risk, assessing the juxtaposition of protected 
forest blocks and corridors with unprotected land, and identifying critical areas for 
maintaining or establishing habitat connectivity.  Spatial analyses of these features 
could be conducted using remote-sensing products.  Other studies that examine the 
effects of human demographics on habitat fragmentation could be extremely important 
for identifying priority areas for conservation efforts and directing development to less 
sensitive areas.

Wetlands

Description:
Much of the information on wetlands provided below was adapted from Kiviat and 
Stevens (2001).
 
	 Tidal and Non-Tidal Wetlands

The Hudson River Estuary corridor contains a rich diversity of wetland types, which 
in turn supports a variety of plant, wildlife, and fish species. About 29 of the 57 wet-
land community types occurring in New York have been documented in the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor (Howard et al. 2002, Edinger et al. 2002).  Wetlands represent 
a transition between aquatic and terrestrial systems and as such, generally support 
high species diversity.  Some wetlands (e.g., bogs) support low species diversity but 
represent an important component of biodiversity at the landscape scale.

Tidal wetlands occur along the 152-mile Hudson River estuary and include brack-
ish tidal marsh, brackish intertidal mudflats, freshwater tidal swamp, freshwater tidal 
marsh, and freshwater intertidal mudflats.  The species composition of Hudson River 
Estuary wetlands change as the water characteristics change from brackish to fresh.  
Examples of non-tidal wetlands include fens, bogs, scrub-shrub swamp, and forested, 
floodplain, and headwater wetlands. 

Tidal wetlands of the Hudson River Estuary corridor include (Kiviat and Stevens 
2001):

Fresh and Brackish Subtidal Shallows: The subtidal shallows is the zone 
between the mean low water  elevation and approximately 6.5 ft below mean low 
water.  This zone supports beds of submerged vegetation, which are well-known 
for their importance to fish and waterfowl.  In some areas, the subtidal shallows 
extend into portions of tidal tributary mouths. This habitat is found throughout the 
tidal Hudson, but is more extensive in shallower reaches of the river, including the 
Haverstraw Bay-Tappan Zee and areas north of Saugerties.

Fresh and Brackish Intertidal and Supratidal Marsh: The intertidal marsh 
is the herbaceous wetland (i.e., dominated by non-woody plants) and mudflat 
zone between mean low water and mean high water.  A supratidal marsh is a 
predominately herbaceous wetland occurring at elevations between mean high 
water and approximately 3.3 ft above mean high water.  Possibly the best-studied 
Hudson River habitat, the marshes attract attention because of their documented 
importance to fish and birds.  These habitats also support many rare plant species, 
are important for recreation, and appear to play a beneficial role in Hudson River 
water quality.  The combined intertidal and supratidal zones cover approximately 
26% of the 58,000 acre high-tide surface area of the tidal Hudson River between 
the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and the New York-New Jersey state line.  The 
intertidal marhes probably comprise somewhat less than half of the 26%.

50

Intertidal and Supratidal Swamp: The intertidal swamp is a wooded 
wetland, dominated by trees or shrubs, occurring in the upper intertidal zone, 
but below mean high water.  A supratidal swamp is a wooded wetland lying 
between mean high water and approximately 3.3 ft above mean high water.  It 
thus receives tidewater only during spring tides and storm tides.  Tidal swamps 
have been studied little in the Hudson or elsewhere on the Atlantic coast.  Hudson 
River intertidal and supratidal swamps are known to support rich biological 
communities, including numerous rare plants and a few rare animals.  Most tidal 
swamp is in highly sheltered areas where tidal wetlands predated the Hudson 
River railroads, on dredge spoil deposits between the railroad and mainland, or at 
stream mouths, between islands and the mainland, and in protected coves.  The 
largest examples are at Mill Creek, Stockport Flats, Rogers Island, Rams Horn 
Creek, and Tivoli Bays.

Tidal Tributary Mouth: The mouths of tributaries where nontidal and tidal 
waters mix, differ in substrate and chemistry from the adjoining aquatic habitats 
of the tributary and Hudson River.  Tidal tributary mouths often have relatively 
scoured, rocky bottoms, fluctuating turbidity, and a shorter ice season than the 
adjoining bays or coves.  These areas are important foraging habitats for fishes 
and water birds, and important spawning habitats for ocean and Hudson River 
fishes.  Tidal stream mouths are found throughout the estuary, although in urban 
areas some streams have been diverted into culverts or artifical channels.

Non-tidal wetlands of the Hudson River Estuary corridor include (Kiviat and Stevens 
2001):

Wet Clay Meadow:  Wet clay meadows are wet meadow or wet oldfield habitats 
on clayey soil; most were formerly agricultural fields.  Post-agricultural wet 
meadows may seem unexceptional on first inspection, but some are significant 
habitats for rare plants.  This habitat should be expected wherever level, non-
forested expanses of clayey soils occur in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, 
generally at 100-200 ft elevation.

Fen and Calcareous Wet 
Meadow: These are open (i.e., 
unshaded by trees), herb-dominated 
(usually sedge-dominated), 
calcerous, shallow wetlands.  Fens 
are distinguished by groundwater 
seepage, and a fen plant community, 
typically including shrubby cinquefoil.  
Calcareous wet meadows may have 
a variety of water sources, and a less 
specialized plant community.  Fens and calcareous wet meadows occur where 
bedrock is limestone or other carbonate rock, or where the soils contain glacier-
transported materials from carbonate rocks.  These habitats support many rare

plants and animals, and are sensitive to hydrological changes and pollution.  Most 
fens and calcareous wet meadows are at low elevations.

Non-Calcareous Wet Meadow: These 
are wetlands with non-calcareous soils and 
groundwater where the soil is saturated for 
part or all of the growing season, but only 
shallowly and briefly inundated, if at all, and 
which support predominantly herbaceous 
(non-woody) vegetation.  Non-calcareous wet 
meadows are common in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor.  They occur where there is 
seepage, or accumulation of rainwater or  
runoff, on soils that are moderately to highly acidic.  Wet meadows usually occur 
where there is or was livestock grazing, mowing, hay cutting, recent abandonment 
of crops, or where woody vegetation has recently been cleared.  Wet meadows 
also occur in beaver meadows (abandoned beaver ponds) and some partially 
drained marshes.  Wet meadows are often associated with the margins of marshes 
or swamps.  Biodiversity values of non-calcareous wet meadows are poorly 
studied.

Hardwood Swamp: In prevalent usage the term swamp refers to a wetland 
dominated by trees or shrubs.  Non-tidal hardwood swamps are fairly common 
in the study area; conifer swamps are very rare, very different ecologically, and 
very important for biodiversity.  Swamps may be inundated throughout, may 
contain only small streams or pools, or may border larger streams, ponds, or 
lakes. Springs or seeps (groundwater discharge) may be present within or at 
the edges of swamps.  Hardwood swamps are more extensive in areas of lower 
human population and are more common and extensive at lower elevations. 
Kettle shrub pools are an important type of swamp habitat, particularly to the 
threatened Blandings turtle.  Kettle shrub pools are deep-flooding, seasonal, 
shrub-dominated wetlands on glacial outwash, originally formed by the melting of 
stranded blocks of glacial ice.

Beaver Pond: Beaver ponds are created by beavers building dams across 
small to medium-sized perennial streams. Beaver ponds flood portions of the 
riparian area for a few years or sometimes longer.  The pond accumulates silt, 
organic matter, and nutrients.  Eventually the beavers die or leave the pond, the 
dam deteriorates, and the water level of the pond draws down, leaving a beaver 
meadow  a silty marsh or wet meadow.  Beaver ponds and beaver meadows 
are different from surrounding habitats and are used by many other animals and 
plants.  Beaver ponds are widespread in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, 
except in areas of high human population density where beaver ponds are usually 
drained to prevent damage to roads, yards, and ornamental trees.

52

Circumneutral Pond Lake: These are calcareous spring-fed water bodies 
with deep, organic substrates, and supporting vegetation of both acidic bogs and 

calcareous marshes.  Floating peat mats and rafts are often present.  Circumneutral 
bog lakes contain a variety of habitats for rare and uncommon species.  Bog lakes 
are probably widespread near the Hudson River Estuary although many (and the 
best known) examples occur farther inland.

Acidic Bog: Acidic bogs are perennially wet, very low-nutrient wetlands 
dominated by low shrubs and peat mosses, with acidic, organic soils.  Bogs are 
rare in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, are strikingly different from other 
wetlands, and support many uncommon and rare plants.

Marsh: Marshes are wetlands dominated by herbaceous (non-woody) plants, 
and with standing water through all or much of the growing season.  Marshes are 
very important habtitats for many species of birds.  A marsh may be isolated from 
other surface waters, may adjoin a pond or stream, or may have a stream flowing 
through it.  Nontidal marshes are widespread throughout the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor, but are mostly at low elevations where more water and nutrients 
collect.

	 Vernal Pools

Vernal pools are seasonal or ephemeral wetlands that form in shallow depressions and 
alternate on an annual basis between a stage of standing water and extreme drying 
conditions.  They are found in a variety of settings, including depressions in upland 
forests, in floodplains, in wet meadows, and as part of large wetland complexes.  By 

definition, vernal pools are free of fish and thus 
can support a rich community of amphibians and 
invertebrates that would be difficult to sustain if 
fish were present.  Vernal pools are a common, but 
threatened habitat type that look unassuming, but 
are critical breeding areas for several species (see 
below).

vation. Photo by Dennis DeMello.

Overall, characteristics of vernal pools vary greatly 
in terms of recharge, discharge, source of water, 
and geology.  Largely fed by precipitation, these 
small pools may be most readily identified in the spring. Often occurring in small 
depressions, many dry up in late summer.  However, a few have water year round.

Ecological Importance:

	 Tidal and Non-Tidal Wetlands

Wetlands are unparalleled in their importance to many fish and wildlife species, 
providing a variety of habitat components such as breeding grounds, nesting sites, 
foraging areas, and other critical habitat.  Because of historical losses in wetlands 
across North America, including New York State, these habitats often support 
endangered, threatened, and special concern plant and animal species.  For example, 

53

the Hudson River Valley contains critical wetland habitat for the federally listed 
bog turtle, Blandings turtle, and northern cricket frog. Additionally, wetlands along 
the Hudson River Estuary are especially important for migratory waterfowl in the 
Atlantic Flyway.  Tidal wetlands of the estuary represent some of the states rarest 
ecological communities and are important as nursery areas for a number of marine 
and anadromous fish.  Furthermore, wetlands perform a variety of unique physical, 
chemical, and biological functions that are essential to the health of the environment.  
Wetlands regulate water flow, protect lake and river shore areas from erosion, and 
improve water quality. 

Quality tidal habitats have low densities of introduced plants such as water-chestnut 
and Eurasian watermilfoil, and smaller fractions of artificial materials (cinder, 
demolition debris, railroad ties) in the sediments.  Many state-listed rare plants (e.g., 
Longs bittercress, spongy arrowhead, estuary beggar-ticks, smooth bur-marigold, 
goldenclub, Fernalds sedge) and other species 
in the Hudson Estuary corridor that are almost 
or completely restricted to the Hudson depend 
upon tidal marsh habitats.  Extensive cattail 
stands, and to some extent mixed cattail stands, 
support breeding birds that depend to a variable 
degree on grass-like marsh plants.  The mouths 
of tributaries, where nontidal and tidal waters 
mix, are important foraging habitats for fishes 
and water birds, and important spawning habitats 
for ocean and Hudson River fishes.

Common animals of nontidal wetlands include white-footed mouse, raccoon, red-
winged blackbird, swamp sparrow, and green frog.  Wetlands are used by muskrat, 
mink, beaver, tree swallow, waterfowl, herons, shorebirds, northern water snake, 
turtles, frogs, and many invertebrates.  Larger live or dead trees often contain cavities 
used by bats, owls, woodpeckers, eastern bluebird, gray treefrog, and other cavity-
using animals.  In addition, many species use the buffer areas surrounding wetlands, 
which may not be protected. 

In general, higher quality nontidal wetlands have a large extent, absence or rarity 
of invasive plants (e.g., purple loosestrife, common reed, reed canary grass), an 
intact buffer zone with minimal impingement by intensive land uses, absence of 
landfills or dumps upstream or upgradient, and light or no livestock grazing.  Large 
mats of floating filamentous algae that cover pools for long periods each year 
indicate overfertilization from external sources.  High quality fen and calcareous 
wet meadows have minimal cover of tall herbs, tall shrubs, or trees.  Higher quality 
wet clay meadows have a greater abundance of sedges (other than tussock sedge).  
Hardwood swamps of high quality have larger trees and more large downed wood in 
the swamp.

	 Vernal Pools

Vernal pools are a common, but threatened habitat type in the Hudson River Estuary 
corridor.  They are often damaged because they are overlooked or not appreciated 
by landowners, or in environmental reviews for development.  Vernal pools and 
their surrounding terrestrial areas provide 
critical habitat for a number of amphibians 
and invertebrates, some of which breed 
only in vernal pools.  Vernal pools are the 
only significant breeding areas for Jefferson 
salamander, spotted salamander, marbled 
salamander, and wood frog.  Other typical 
users include spring peeper, spadefoot toad, 
gray treefrog, American toad, and other 
amphibians that depend on pond habitats for 
reproduction.

Frogs move from the forest to vernal pools where they mate and lay eggs and then 
return to the woods after breeding.  The deposited eggs hatch into tadpoles, which 
transform into adults sometime within 6 to 15 weeks.  Salamanders spend much of 
the year underground in tunnels made by small woodland mammals.  They emerge 
from the ground in early spring and migrate up to half a mile on warm, rainy 
nights to vernal pools.  Once they have deposited their eggs, the adult salamanders 
typically wait for the next rainy night, when they return to the forest.  The developing 
amphibians prey on fairy shrimp, copepods, daphnia, phantom midge larvae, and 
mosquito larvae.  Young adults leave the vernal pools once they have lost all traces of 
gills and return to breed about two to four years later. 

Because these species are largely dependent on vernal pools for breeding success 
(the risk of predation is high in permanent wetlands), the loss of vernal pools in 
upland areas will lead to the loss of amphibian species that depend on them, and thus 
loss of biodiversity.  Amphibians in general are declining worldwide, as are many 
vernal pool dependent amphibians in the Northeast.  Jefferson salamander, marbled 
salamander, and blue-spotted salamander are listed as special concern in New York 
State.  The four-toed salamander, spotted salamander, and wood frog are vernal pool-
using species threatened in the Northeast.

Vernal pools are also important habitat for other species, such as wetland dependent 
turtles (including the state-listed Blandings turtle and spotted turtle), birds (including 
the federally listed American black duck), and small mammals.  In Dutchess County, 
kettle shrub pools (a type of vernal pool formed by the melting of stranded blocks 
of glacial ice) support populations of the threatened Blandings turtle.  Neotropical 
migrant birds such as the worm-eating warbler, veery, and wood thrush also use 
vernal pools.

Conservation Strategies: 

	 Tidal and Non-Tidal Wetlands

Freshwater tidal and non-tidal wetlands in New York State are protected under the 
Freshwater Wetlands Act, Article 24 and salt-water tidal wetlands in the lower estuary 
are regulated under theTidal Wetlands Act, Article 25 of the Environmental Conservation 
Law.  However, most small freshwater wetlands less than 12.4 acres are not covered 
under this legislation. Exceptions are certain smaller wetlands of unusual local 
importance and wetlands above one acre in size that are regulated within the Adirondack 
Park. Efforts to identify and protect smaller wetlands should be encouraged.  Adequate 
protection of the uplands buffering wetlands is essential to preserving the integrity of 
wetland ecosystems and habitat quality for wildlife. 

Physical disturbances to tidal wetlands should be avoided or minimized, and tidal 
flushing should be fully maintained.  Dredge spoil disposal in the last century has 
eliminated large areas of tidal wetlands, especially between Saugerties and Albany.  
Large areas have also been filled for 
construction of the railroads and for 
urban-industrial development, especially 
in the Westchester and Albany areas.  
Pervasive chemical pollutants, such as 
PCB and metals, have contaminated 
the water and substrates of the Hudson 
River tidal habitats.  Power boating 
and jet skiing in the shallows can have 
numerous effects, including pollution 
and toxic effects on organisms.  
Motorized craft should be excluded from 
shallows as much as possible to prevent 
pollution, and disturbance of animals and 
plants there.  Abandoned and derelict duck blinds should be removed from tidal wetland 
habitats and duck hunters encouraged to use temporary blinds that are removed each 
season.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NYSDEC are studying the potential for 
restoring some of the subtidal and intertidal habitat altered by spoil disposal.

The mouths of tributaries are degraded by stream channel alteration and water pollution, 
particularly near urban-industrial areas.  Removal of obsolete dams and other structures, 
and restoration of stream bank plant communities would benefit tributary mouths.  In 
some cases, fish ladders may be needed to provide access for spawning above dams that 
cannot be removed.  Boat traffic in some areas constitutes intense disturbance of tributary 
mouth and tidal habitats.  Finally, restoration of tidal flow should be emphasized and may 
require the installation of structures that allow flows to bypass obstructions.

Without mowing, burning or grazing, wet meadows are likely to be overgrown by purple 
loosestrife, shrubs and trees.  Common reed is also a potential problem.   Invasive species 
monitoring and control efforts will be particularly effective on sites that currently have 

56

minimal invasive species problems. Recent advances in reducing purple loosestrife are 
encouraging and may present opportunities for local community involvement in the 
future.

Non-tidal wetlands, like tidal wetlands, are sensitive to hydrological changes and 
pollution.  Filling, dumping, damming, excavation (to create ponds), siltation, 
pollution (from road or agricultural runoff), alteration of vegetation, and drainage are 
destructive to wetlands.  Upstream changes in water quantity (changes in hydrology) 
or quality also impact wetlands.  The woody vegetation in communities such as red 
maple-hardwood swamps and dwarf shrub bogs is often killed by higher water levels 
caused by downstream dams or road-bed impoundments.  Low-intensity grazing or hay 
cutting may be compatible with biodiversity in some types 
of wetlands, depending on the kinds of rare or uncommon 
biota present.  Restoration or protection of wetland 
hydrology, restoration of wetland plant communities, 
maintenance of buffer zones, control of invasive species, 
identification and protection of smaller wetlands, and 
management of certain types of wetlands through mowing, 
grazing or burning are conservation management actions 
needed for wetlands.  Best Management Practices (BMPs) 
for timber harvesting (Welsch et al. 1995) and agricultural 
operations to promote wetland conservation should be 
encouraged and implemented in the Hudson River Valley. 

	 Vernal Pools

Identification and mapping of vernal pools is a necessary first step in their 
conservation.  Learning how to recognize these pools, even in the dry season, is of 
critical importance. Vernal pools can be identified through a variety of signs and 
plant species that may indicate their presence.  Some of these identifiers include 
blackened and compressed leaf litter, buttressed tree trunks, water marked tree trunks, 
and vegetation such as red maple, highbush blueberry, and buttonbush.  Pools should 
be identified in late winter or early spring when they are most readily recognized.  
Calhoun and Klemens (2002) recommend Best Development Practices and planning 
tools for conserving vernal pool wildlife and Welsch et al. (1995) provides Best 
Management Practices for timber harvesters.  Management plans for foresters and 
local governments (master planning or open space planning) should call for identifying 
the location of any vernal pools, and the establishment of protective buffer zones 
around these areas.  Reschke (1990) points out that more data on characteristic plants 
and invertebrates are needed.

Albany Pine Bush

Site Description:
The Albany Pine Bush includes the remaining undeveloped sandplain habitat in the Al-
bany Pine Bush, including all parcels of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve, the intervening 
lands that connect these protected parcels, and some of the surrounding areas adjacent to 
the Preserve.  The area encompasses the regionally rare pine barrens communities and 
interspersed forest and wetland communities that support rare and highly localized insect 
species populations as well as rare amphibians, reptiles, and plants.  The area is about 
6.54 miles long by 3.5 miles wide and covers about 9,000 acres.

The Albany Pine Bush is underlain by 
shale (Normanskill shale) from the Or-
dovician period, however the overriding 
influence on the Pine Bush comes from the 
surficial deposits of sand.  These are dune 
deposits formed when wind carried sand 
from drained glacial lakes about 10,000 
years ago.  The deep, well-drained sand 
deposits left poor soils that had a large 
influence on the communities that could 
establish there.

Ecological Significance:
The Albany Pine Bush is regionally significant as the largest remaining inland pine bar-
rens in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  The Albany Pine Bush contains exemplary 
occurrences of the globally rare pitch pine scrub oak barrens and several exemplary oc-
currences of pine-barrens vernal pools. A rare plant associated with pine-barrens vernal 
pools is the red rooted flatsedge. Other significant plant species in the area include the 
globally rare and federal species of special concern bog bluegrass, the globally rare 
orchid, Bayards malaxis, and the only extant occurrence in the state of the globally rare 
adders-mouth.  The Albany Pine Bush is nationally recognized for its populations of rare

butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). There are hundreds of Lepidoptera species found in 
the Pine Bush, including the federally listed Karner blue butterfly and over 40 noctuid 
moths (Noctuidae) considered to be pine barrens specialists.  The Karner blue depends on 
dry, open, sandplain communities such as the pitch pine-scrub oak barrens found at the 
Albany Pine Bush.

Animal species of state special concern and on the NY Natural Heritage watch list 
found in the Albany Pine Bush include Jeffersons salamander, blue-spotted salamander, 
eastern spadefoot toad (one of only three occurrences known north of Long Island), spot-
ted turtle and eastern hognose snake.

Fire suppression has resulted in the conversion of some of the pine barrens to succession-
al hardwood forest.  However, active management and the use of prescribed fire are re-
storing the area to a more characteristic and functioning pine barrens.  The restoration and 
repeated burning has created a complex of related communities that form a gradient from 
grassy openings to dense canopy forests.  Part of this gradient is pitch pine-oak forest and 
pitch pine-scrub oak barrens that form a shifting mosaic.  Nested within these areas are 
pine barrens vernal ponds that are important breeding habitat for amphibian species.

Conservation issues and recommendations:
Invasive exotic species, as well as native invasives such as aspens and black locust have 
altered the composition and structure of the ecological communities and the habitat of 
many rare species. Plant succession, often as a result of fire suppression, has had similar 
effects. The Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission, a multi-agency team, has under-
taken efforts for many years to address these concerns, resulting in the protection of 
many globally rare species and communities in the Pine Bush.  The management plan 
for the Pine Bush developed by the Albany Pine Bush Commission should be supported 
and implemented. Prescribed burning and other management techniques in the Albany 
Pine Bush should be carried out to restore the successional forests to pine barrens and to 
maintain the mosaic of existing pine barrens communities.  Ongoing protection efforts 
are focused on high priority parcels.  See the management plan developed for the Albany 
Pine Bush Preserve Commission for additional information.  Additional inventory work 
is needed.

Location Description:
This area is an expanded representation of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 
Albany Pine Bush Significant Habitat Complex.  The site generally follows the Conrail 
railroad tracks on the north and the Albany city line on the south as far east as Interstate 
87; the western portion of the site is defined by the outer limits of the Preserve and any 
adjacent natural areas that have the potential to be restored to a pine barren community 
type.

Arthur Kill

Site Description: 
The Arthur Kill includes important nesting and foraging sites for several species of her-
ons, egrets, and ibises as well as for gulls and waterfowl. The freshwater wetland areas 
and forested buffers are also extremely important as some of the only remaining open 
space in metropolitan New York suitable as feeding and roosting areas for waterbirds 
and migratory stopover habitat for songbirds and raptors. This area also contains several 
plants and natural communities reaching their northeast limit, thus making them rare in 
New York State.

Site Location:
The Arthur Kill includes the northwestern corner of Staten Island in New York City and 
adjacent portions of the Arthur Kill and Kill van Kull in both New York and New Jersey.  
Although not considered part of the Hudson River Estuary Watershed, this site is included 
in this report due to its presence in the conservation area, which is defined as the counties 
bordering the Hudson River Estuary.

Ecological Significance:
The Arthur Kill is notable for the network of remaining upland and wetland open space 
within a highly industrialized area. These remaining natural communities support region-
ally significant fish and wildlife populations, especially wading birds.  Of primary signifi-
cance in this area is the presence of major nesting colonies and foraging areas of herons, 
egrets, and ibises in a complex of closely associated natural habitats occurring within a 
major metropolitan area.  The three island colonies established in the area represent the 
largest heronry complex in New York State and support thousands of pairs of a variety of 
species of colonial wading birds, many of which are of special concern in the region.  The 
Arthur Kill also serves as an important location for nesting waterfowl and many neotropi-
cal migrant songbirds. Examples of significant and regionally rare species and communi-
ties occurring in this area include red maple sweet gum swamp, southern leopard frog, 
and the globally rare Nantucket juneberry.

62

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
This unique and regionally significant wetlands and heronry complex is within one of 
the most intensively industrialized and urbanized corridors in the northeastern United 
States, and is subject to both physical and qualitative losses of habitat due to chemical 
and nutrient pollution stresses, storm water and sewage discharges, stream channeliza-
tion, nonpoint source runoff, illegal filling and dumping activities, fragmentation and 
loss of connecting corridors, loss of upland buffers, invasive species, mammalian preda-
tors, uninformed or poorly planned land and waterfront development, human related 
disturbances, and dredging and other changes in 
channel flows, among other impacts.  Protection 
of the heronries, wetland foraging areas, and rare 
plants and communities of this regionally significant 
habitat complex should be accorded high prior-
ity and sought through a multitude of appropriate 
land protection mechanisms, including cooperative 
conservation and management agreements with land 
owners, improved local zoning and land use regula-
tions, easements, land exchanges and, in some cases, 
acquisition. Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
This area is included in the USFWS Arthur Kill Significant Habitat Complex.  The area 
consists of a contiguous area on the northwest corner of Staten Island, the entire length of 
the Arthur Kill from its junction with Newark Bay south to the Outerbridge (Route 440) 
on the south, and several tributary corridors to the Arthur Kill in New Jersey. The con-
tiguous Staten Island area is bounded by the Kill van Kull and Newark Bay on the north, 
by Fresh Kills and Isle of Meadows on the south, and by several road systems on Staten 
Island on the east. On the western side of the Arthur Kill, the area includes several New 
Jersey tributary corridors.

Catskill Mountains

Site Description:
The Catskill Mountains contain major unfragmented forests, including first growth forest, 
as well as alpine communities, gorges, pristine headwater streams, and reservoirs; the 
area supports regionally significant populations of forest interior nesting birds, bald eagle, 
large mammals, coldwater fish, reptiles, and rare communities and plants.  The Catskill 
Mountains significant biodiversity area is roughly circular and about 40 miles across at its 
widest point.  The entire area coves 485,000 acres, of which 361,000 acres fall within the 
Hudson River Estuary conservation area (435,000 acres are in Greene and Ulster Coun-
ties).

63

Schoharie Creek runs out of the Catskill Moun-
tains to the north.  Esopus Creek drains the ma-
jority of the mountain range as it runs through its 
center and into Ashokan Reservoir at the south-
eastern edge of the area.  Rondout Creek fills 
Rondout Reservoir at the southwestern border of 
the area.  The Catskill Aqueduct, a major water 
source for New York City, begins at Ashokan 
Reservoir.

Two community types occur as matrix forests in the Catskills.  Beech-maple mesic forest 
is common on the valleys and slopes while hemlock-northern hardwood forest is com-
mon in cool ravines and steep-sided slopes.   The rare Bicknells thrush breeds in moun-
tain spruce fir and mountain fir communities on Hunter Mountain and its satellite peaks.  
Large patch communities include chestnut oak forest, mountain spruce-fir forest, red 
maple-tamarack peat swamp, and spruce-northern hardwood forest.  Small patch com-
munities include cliff community, ice cave talus community, hemlock-hardwood swamp, 
mountain fir forest, mountain spruce-fir forest, spruce-fir rocky summit, pitch pine-oak-
heath rocky summit, and sedge meadow.  Many of these patch communities occur in 
relatively stable, bounded geographic regions defined by the mountainous landscape.

The Catskills make up the eastern edge of the Allegheny Plateau in New York.  This pla-
teau is of Devonian age (410 to 360 million years ago) and formed when New York was 
covered in a shallow sea; the Catskill deposits were mainly from the mouths of rivers and 
the edge of the sea.  Surface deposits are shallow and usually classified as rock or til.

The Catskill Mountains are in eastern New York on the west side of the Hudson River 
Valley.

Ecological Significance:
The ecological significance of the Catskill Mountains relates to its large, continuous for-
est and pristine headwater stream habitats, and the species dependent on these habitats.  
The Catskill area includes important areas of old-growth forest (areas that were never 
logged due to their inaccessibility), of which less than 1% remains in the eastern decidu-
ous forest region of eastern North America.  The total area of first growth forests in the 
Catskills is estimated to be between 53,400 and 63,300 acres.  The Catskills are home to 
numerous rare plant species.  Examples include the federally listed threatened Northern 
monks hood, the globally rare Jacobs ladder, the state-listed endangered roseroot stone-
crop, and the state-listed threatened fragrant cliff fern.  East of the Mississippi River, 
muskroot is only known from within refrigerated talus slopes within the Catskills.  Some 
of the worlds best populations of the federally protected Northern monks hood are found 
within the Catskills.  In fact, the only places within the northeast to see this plant in its 
native landscape are within the Catskill Mountains.  Additionally, exemplary occurrences 
of a number of significant communities can be found in the Catskills. Examples include 
many ecologically significant cliff and ledge communities associated with steep-sided 
ravines, and exemplary occurrences of red maple-tamarack peat swamp and hemlock-
hardwood swamp. 

65

The Catskills are home to more than 120 species of breeding birds including the rare 
Bicknells thrush and several regionally rare raptors such as bald eagle (also a large 
wintering population), red-shouldered hawk, broad-winged hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, 
and barred owl.  Other important animals that live in the Catskills include regionally rare 
reptiles and amphibians such as timber rattlesnake, eastern hognose snake, spotted turtle, 
wood turtle and spotted salamander, and several large mammals such as black bear, bob-
cat, and fisher.  Black bear and bobcat depend on the large tracts of unbroken forest that 
this region provides.

Recent surveys resulted in the discovery of the White Mountain tiger beetle, a globally 
rare species that occurs on the vegetated sections of stream cobble bars, along Esopus 
Creek (Howard et al. 2002).  A survey for rare Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths) 
resulted in the discovery of West Virginia White in this area (Howard et al. 2002).  This 
species is recorded from only three other locations in the state and this location is the 
only within the Hudson River Estuary corridor.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Agricultural, residential, and commercial activities and roads are most concentrated in the 
Catskill valleys.  The highest conservation priorities in the Catskills are the protection of 
riparian and upland habitat in the valleys, old growth forests, and habitats of rare plants 
and animals. This should be accomplished through cooperative efforts among the state, 
New York City, local communities, and private landowners.  Additional inventory work is 
also needed.

Location Description:
This area is also identified by the USFWS as the Catskill High Peaks Significant Habi-
tat Complex.  The Catskill Mountains significant area is a roughly circular area about 
40 miles in diameter that includes the core forested high elevation area of the eastern 
Catskill Mountains and adjacent reservoirs and reservoir lands. The site follows the break 
in slope along the escarpment between the Catskills and the Hudson Valley on the east, 
the southern boundaries of the Ashokan and Rondout Reservoir watersheds on the south, 
and generally follows the 2,000 foot contour on the west and north. With the exception of 
the reservoir lands, this area generally corresponds to the Catskill High Peaks Ecozone as 
defined by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

 

 

Delaware/Mongaup Rivers

 

 

Site Description:
The Delaware/Mongaup Rivers includes the New York State bald eagle buffer protection 
zone and the New York State Mongaup Wildlife Management Area (WMA).  This area 
is nationally and regionally significant for its pristine landscape.  It contains exemplary 
populations of state and federally listed plant and animal species and regionally rare eco-
logical communities.  Although not considered part of the Hudson River Estuary corridor, 

66

this site is included in this report due to its presence in the conservation area, which is 
defined as the counties bordering the Hudson River Estuary.

Site Location: 
Along the border of New York and Pennsylvania, near the tri-state junction of New York, 
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

Ecological Significance: 
The Delaware River is the longest free-flowing river 
in the northeastern United States.  It supports the 
largest wintering bald eagle concentrations in New 
York State and one of the largest in the northeastern 
United States.  Other regionally rare animal species 
in the area include the red-shouldered hawk and the 
timber rattlesnake.  The area also contains exemplary 
occurrences of significant ecological communities 
including pitch pine-oak-heath woodland community 
and riverside ice meadow community.
   
Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Encourage landowner practices that protect wildlife

Location Description: 
The Delaware/Mongaup River significant area is a 2-mile (radius) buffer that begins at 
the Shawangunk Ridge significant area boundary and follows the Upper Delaware Na-
tional Scenic and Recreational River for the length of Orange County and then follows 
the Mongaup River extending from the Delaware north to the Mongaup Falls Reservoir. 

Dutchess County Wetlands

Site Description:
The Dutchess County Wetlands area is a network of four major wetland complexes that 
provide important habitat for a variety of amphibian, reptile, and bird species.  This area 
contains the highest diversity of turtles in New York State.  The significant area encom-
passes several wetlands and their watersheds, and wetland buffer zones that are biologi-

67

cally significant for breeding waterfowl, rare turtles, plants, and other species, as well 
as intervening areas that contain potential habitat for these species.  Floodplain forest 
communities also exist within this area. 

The four separate wetland complexes total 66,000 acres.  Two of the complexes (Milan 
Window and Stissing Mountain sites) feed Wappinger Creek, which then flows along the 
eastern edge of Poughkeepsie and through Wappinger Falls before flowing into the Hud-
son River.  The southernmost complex (La Grange/East Fishkill site) contains wetlands 
that flow into Fishkill Creek, which flows through Beacon and then directly into the Hud-
son River about 8 miles after leaving the area.  The East Park/Hyde Park site encompass-
es most of Crum Elbow Creek, from its beginning near Wurtemburg to approximately 0.5 
mile of the Hudson River. 

The Dutchess County Wetlands fall mostly in the lowlands of the Hudson River Wa-
tershed, and consist mainly of soft sedimentary rocks that are easily eroded and with 
relatively little topography.  These lowlands tend to facilitate slow moving water and 
extensive wetland formation.  Some of the Dutchess County Wetland sites, particularly 
Stissing Mountain, are part of the Taconic ranges more resistant metamorphic rocks.  The 
high variety in rock types helps support a high diversity of flora and fauna.

Site Location:
The wetlands occur east of the Hudson River in western Dutchess County from Interstate 
84 north to the Dutchess Columbia county line.

Ecological Significance:
Dutchess County is made up of wetland complexes with many habitats that are unusual 
or scarce in the region. In addition to being valuable in their own right, these wetlands 
support a number of local populations of the state listed threatened Blandings turtle, one 
of the few sites for this species in the northeastern United States.  These wetlands also 
support the state-endangered bog turtle.  Other rare reptile and amphibian species in this 
area include the state listed northern cricket frog (the only known occurrence of this spe-
cies east of the Hudson River), and the regionally rare blue-spotted salamander, marbled 
salamander, four toed salamander, spotted turtle, wood turtle, eastern box turtle, red 

68

bellied snake, and eastern ribbon snake.  The only documented consistent overwintering 
by golden eagles in the region occurs in this area.  Additionally, pied-billed grebe nest-
ing sites and great blue heron rookeries have been documented in the area. The extensive 
complex of diverse wetlands and upland forests include rich red maple hardwood swamps 
containing the state rare swamp cottonwood, floodplain forest, deep emergent marsh, rich 
sloping fen, and medium fen communities.  Other rare plant species include prairie sedge 
and the state listed rare smartweed dodder.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:

Suburban expansion, along with runoff from nearby 
roads, agricultural lands, and developed areas, pose the 
most serious threats to this wetland ecosystem.  Fur-
ther study of the distribution, population status, habitat 
use, and movement patterns of the bog and Blandings 
turtles, and other species, is needed. Protection of 
wetlands and their buffer zones, as well as of the move-
ment corridors and road crossings between wetlands, 
is the highest priority.  Additional inventory is greatly 
needed, especially with respect to amphibians and reptiles, and mapping of habitat com-
plexes for the Blandings turtle.

Location Description: 
This area is similar to the USFWS Dutchess County Wetlands Significant Habitat Com-
plex.  The four wetland complexes included within this area are, from south to north: La 
Grange/East Fishkill, East Park/Hyde Park, Milan Window, and Stissing Mountain.

 

 

Esopus/Lloyd Wetlands and Ridges

 

 
Site Description:
Esopus/Lloyd Wetlands and Ridges contain wetland and upland habitat that is of par-
ticular importance to amphibian species and breeding waterfowl.  Upland communities 
include ridges, ledges, and a mature hemlock-northern hardwood forest.  The area has 
32,391 acres.  The main drainages in this area are the Swarte Kill, which flows into the 
Wallkill River to the north and Black Creek, which flows into the Hudson River to the 
east. 

Most of this area is underlain by glacial till with large sections of soil underlain by bed-
rock along the eastern side of the area.  Also of continental glacial origin, there are many 
small kame deposits; these are deposits with similar components of glacial till, but with 
the fine grains (silts and clays) removed by water action.  These fine-grained materials 
were re-deposited in places such as the lacustrine (lake) silt and clay, lacustrine delta, and 
lacustrine sand deposits.  More recent surficial deposits are the swamp deposits high 
in organic matter, and the river and stream deposits labeled as recent alluvium.  The 
bedrock geology consists of shale (Normanskill shale and Austin Glen formation) in the 

69

western lowland portion of the area and more resistant quartzlike (Quassaic quartzite) in 
the hills in the eastern section of the area.  The quartzlike localities were more resistant 
to the erosional forces of the glaciers and thus are now elevated above the nearby locales 
and are not buried in till.  Communities on the quartzite deposits consist of more upland 
and drier community types, while those on the lowland-till-overlaying-shale substrate 
will be more mixed, with wetland and upland communities.

Ecological Significance:
The area encompasses significant wet-
land communities that serve as critical 
habitat for threatened amphibian spe-
cies as well as breeding populations of 
waterfowl.  The state-threatened small 
flowered crowfoot has been documented 
in this area.  Only 16 sites are known for 
this species statewide, all of which occur 
within the Hudson River Estuary cor-
ridor.  This area provides crucial habitat 
for the state-listed northern cricket frog.  
The northern cricket frog prefers shal-
low vegetated shorelines and bays.  It also includes several significant and rare ecologi-
cal communities including one of the largest dwarf shrub bog occurrences in the Hudson 
River Valley.  The area contains a mature, good condition hemlock northern hardwood 
forest and good condition red maple hardwood swamp, Appalachian oak-hickory forest, 
and beech-maple mesic forest.  One of the wetlands contains one of the largest popula-
tions of the state-rare twayblade (Liparis lilfolia) in the Northeast.  In general, these wet-
lands contain many regional rare or uncommon plants with specific habitat requirements 
(e.g. grass pink, pitcher-plant, rose pogonia).  Without proper protection, these plants are 
likely to be placed on the state rare plant list.
 
Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Suburban expansion, along with runoff from nearby roads, agricultural lands, and devel-
oped areas, pose the most serious threats to the wetland ecosystem and associated cricket 
frog populations and other species and communities. Local planning and the reduction of 
polluted runoff in the vicinity of the wetlands will support the viability of these elements 
of biodiversity.  Additional inventory work is needed.

Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Site Description:
The Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands are composed of the valleys and adjacent ridges 
in the Taconic Highlands.  Wetland communities include red maple-hardwood swamp, 
floodplain forest, fens, and shallow emergent marsh.  These areas contain high quality 
habitat for a number of wetland-dependent species and some of the best bog turtle habi-
tat in the Hudson River Valley.  This area also includes adjacent upland ridge and ledge 
habitat that is especially important for northern copperhead, timber rattlesnake, and five 
lined skink. 

The area is made up of two separate wetland complexes totaling 94,000 acres.  Both com-
plexes occur in the valleys and adjacent ridges of the southern Taconic Highlands.  The 
Northeast-Ancram fen complex occurs in Columbia and Dutchess Counties (the northern 
complex).  The portion within the Hudson River Estuary Watershed includes wetlands 
drained by Punch Brook Swamp, the Noster Kill, and the Roeliff Jansen Kill.  The Great 
Swamp area (the southern complex) is in Dutchess and Putnam Counties.  The portion 
within the Hudson River Estuary Watershed includes the headwaters of the Croton River 
and the South Flow of the Great Swamp.  The portion in the Connecticut River Water-
shed includes the North Flow of the Great Swamp and the headwaters of the Housa-
tonic River.

The majority of the Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands biodiversity area consists of 
Stockbridge Marble, a metamorphic rock composed of the minerals calcite or dolomite.  
It is formed when limestone is treated to very high temperature and pressure, such as the 
Taconics mountain forming process.  Because of the proximity of this area to the Taconic 
Mountains, other bedrock components of the area are also mostly metamorphosed rocks 
(e.g., gneiss, schist, and to a lesser extent, quartzite).  These materials are more resistant 
to erosion than their non-metamorphosed relatives, however their basic (non-acidic) 
composition maintains wetlands high in pH.  Interestingly, because of the nearby Taconic 
Mountains and the convoluted nature of the bedrock (many layers, wide ranges in meta-
morphism), water upwellings and springs are common in this region.  The result is a 
preponderance of communities dependent on freshwater upwellings of high pH water, 
namely fens.  Other calcareous regions (Hudson Valley Limestone and Shale Ridges, 
Dutchess County Wetlands, Esopus Lloyd Wetlands) have much fewer occurrences of fen 
communities than the Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands biodiversity area.  Most of the 
surficial geology deposits are of glacial origin, such as till, kame deposits, and outwash 
sand and gravel.  Other deposits, such as those in the wetlands, consist of more recent al-
luvium and organic deposits.

71

Wetland matrix communities consist of red 
maple-hardwood swamp and floodplain for-
est.  The upland matrix community tends to 
be Appalachian oak-hickory forest.  Patch 
communities include inland Atlantic white 
cedar swamp, red maple-tamarack peat 
swamp, rich graminoid fen, rich shrub fen, 
rich sloping fen, and shallow emergent 
marsh.  Upland patch communities include 
pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit, rocky 
summit grassland, and hemlock-northern 
hardwood forest.

Site Location:
This area is within easternmost Putnam, Dutchess, and Columbia Counties. Two separate 
wetland complexes are recognized: the Great Swamp from Brewster, New York north 
to South Amenia, New York, and the Northeast Ancram fen complex from Sharon, 
Connecticut, north to Copake Falls, New York. The lowlands occupy a long north south 
valley west of the Taconic Mountains called the Harlem Valley (after the railroad line) 
from which this complex takes its name.

Ecological Significance:
The site encompasses the calcareous wetlands and uplands and ridgetop habitat that sup-
port rare reptiles, waterfowl, and raptors, as well as rare plant habitats and communities.

The mosaic of calcareous wetlands and adjacent uplands in the Harlem Valley supports 
regionally significant rare reptile populations and rare calcareous communities and plant 
species. These calcareous wetlands have truly exceptional concentrations of rare ele-
ments. The significant area is considered to contain the best bog turtle habitat in this Hud-

72

son Valley region.  Three additional fens within the area were recently found to contain 
the state endangered (federally listed threatened) bog turtle (Howard et al. 2002).  In all, 
26 occurrences of bog turtle have been recorded for the Harlem Valley Calcareous Wet-
lands biodiversity area.  This area also contains 11 hibernacula for the state-threatened 
timber rattlesnake.  Other rare animals recorded include Eastern pondmussel and upland 
sandpiper.  Recently, The Nature Conservancy purchased a very significant rich sloping 
fen with a bog turtle population, increasing protection of the bog turtles, fen communi-
ties, and rare plants present there.

Some of the fens and fen like areas of the site also support regionally rare plants. Great 
Swamp has several rare calcareous communities and plants.  In addition to timber rattle-
snake populations, the ledges, talus, acidic rocky crest savannas, woodlands, burn areas, 
and associated habitats also support northern copperhead and five lined skink.  The area 
supports several regionally rare species such as bladderwort, three toothed cinquefoil, and 
the dogwood thyatirid moth. The deeper marshes and some of the ponds in this area are 
important habitats for waterfowl and marsh birds.  The extensive wooded swamps sup-
port breeding red shouldered hawk and concentrations of migrating warblers.  Also no-
table in the region is an extensive, old growth, hardwoods floodplain savanna with huge 
ashes and maples, unlike anything else in the region.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Suburban expansion and invasive species are the 
two central conservation issues in this area. Further 
study and field surveys of the distribution, popula-
tion status, habitat use, and movement patterns of the 
bog turtle, in particular, and other species are needed 
throughout the entire complex of calcareous wetlands 
in the tri state region. Protection of wetlands, their 
Ledge habitat.  Photo by Paul Jensen.
buffer zones, and movement corridors connecting wetlands, is a high priority.  These ef-
forts should help direct suburban development to less sensitive areas.      

Location Description:
This area is similar to the USFWS Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands Significant Habi-
tat Complex.  The Great Swamp follows the ridgetops that form the immediate watershed 
of the wetlands.  Great Swamp habitat area includes the wetlands of the Harlem Valley 
adjacent and proximate to the East Branch of the Croton River, Swamp River, and Ten 
Mile River; marble hills emerging from the floor of the Harlem Valley; and mountain-
ous slopes on the east and west sides of the Harlem Valley.  There is a drainage divide 
between the Hudson River and the Housatonic River Watersheds at the village of Pawl-
ing where the East Branch of the Croton River flows to the south into the Hudson and the 
Swamp River flows to the north into the Housatonic Watershed. Although the watersheds 
are separate, the swamp itself is continuous over both watersheds.

73

The Northeast Ancram fen complex follows the ridgetop of the Taconic Mountain range 
(Washburn, Alander, Brace, and Thorpe Mountains) from Copake, New York, southward 
to State Line, Connecticut. Included is the wetland complex at State Line and the ridges 
just west of Indian Lake south to Sharon Station Road. This site includes the wetlands 
and immediate watershed of the Drowned Lands Swamp, Punch Brook, and Bashbish 
Brook on the western half of this complex, and the chain of wetlands along the Noster 
Kill and Webatuck Creek on the eastern half of this complex; it includes the Panhandle or 
Oblong of the northeastern corner of Dutchess County southward towards Millerton, and 
the western escarpment of the Taconic Mountains. The southern portion of the Panhandle 
wetlands and the wetlands south of Millerton drain southeastward to the Housatonic 
Watershed. The northern portion of the Panhandle wetlands and the Drowned Lands area 
drain into the Roeliff Jansen Kill, which is part of the Hudson River Watershed.

Highlands

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Site Description:
The Highlands are noteworthy as a relatively undevel-
oped corridor of forests, wetlands, and grasslands of 
regional importance to breeding and migratory birds, 
resident amphibians and reptiles, and rare plants and 
communities close to the New York City metropoli-
tan area.  It is significant for its high concentration of 
species and communities of special regional emphasis 
dependent on large, unfragmented forest and wetland 
habitats.

The portion of the Highlands west of the Hudson River 
includes 190,243 acres within the State of New York 
and continues west to cross the entire State of New Jer-
sey.  The portion of the Highlands east of the Hudson 
River totals 215,137 acres in Dutchess, Putnam, and 
Westchester counties extending from the Hudson River 
to the Connecticut border.  Ridgelines and valleys, including stream courses and wetlands 
and lakes are generally in a northeast to southwest alignment.  Streams run directly into 
the Hudson River Estuary, otherwise they generally run into the Ramapo River, which 
flows south through the center of the Highlands west of the Hudson River.  Major streams 
east of the Hudson River include Canopus Creek, Peekskill Hollow Creek, and the Cro-
ton River.  The Delaware Aqueduct, a major water source for New York City, begins at 
the West Branch Reservoir within the Highlands.

The Highlands.  Photo by Paul Jensen.

There is a large diversity of bedrock types in the Highlands.  These rocks are the oldest 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor at 1.3 billion years old; they were formed during 
the same process that formed the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York.  The high 
complexity indicates that these layers have been compressed, bent, twisted, and otherwise 
metamorphosed into erosion-resistant bedrock that form the mountains of southeastern 

74

New York.  The folds and faults in the bedrock are generally parallel to each other and 
generally determine the positions of the ridges and valleys.  A large fault, the Ramapo 
Fault, coincides with the path of the Hudson River and separates the Highlands East from 
the Highlands West.  The complexity of the Highlands bedrock acts to increase the di-
versity of the communities and taxa (animal and plant species and subspecies) present by 
increasing the types and range of minerals and nutrients available.  Areas on the surface 
that are not bedrock outcrops usually consist of glacial till or more recent riverine or lake 
deposits.

The matrix communities of the Highlands in-
clude Appalachian oak-hickory forest, chestnut 
oak forest, and oak-tulip tree forest.  Recently, a 
5,681-acre chestnut oak forest was documented, 
along with a 2,071-acre Appalachian oak-hick-
ory forest.  A large matrix chestnut oak forest 
of 45,000 acres links the West Point Military 
Academy with the occurrence of this community 
in Black Rock Forest and Harriman and Bear 
Mountain State Parks.  Hemlock-northern hard-
wood forest acts as a large patch community here, in comparison to the more northern 
Catskill Mountains where it may be matrix forest as well.  Dispersed among the matrix 
forests are patch communities such as pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit, rocky sum-
mit grassland, and acidic talus slope woodland, which may be either large patch or small 
patch, and red cedar rocky summit, inland white cedar swamp, rich graminoid fen, dwarf 
shrub bog, highbush blueberry bog thicket, and cliff community, which tend to be small 
patch communities.

Ecological Significance:
This significant area represents one of the largest unfragmented landscape blocks in 
New York State that creates an important landscape corridor that links the mid-Atlantic 
states (New Jersey and Pennsylvania) with New England.  Along with the continuous 
and relatively unfragmented forests, the area contains higher elevation ridges and several 
networks of relatively undisturbed wetlands in the valleys.  The ecological significance 
of this area relates to its large, contiguous forest and wetland habitats and the disturbance 
sensitive species dependent on these habitats, as well as the diversity of plants, communi-
ties, and animals unique to this region.

Species populations in the Highlands are indicative of large contiguous areas of undis-
turbed forest and wetland habitats and include wood turtle, timber rattlesnake, red shoul-
dered hawk, barred owl, warblers and thrushes, black bear, and bobcat.  The rare cerulean 
warbler, a forest-interior specialist, has a thriving population in the deciduous forests of 
the Highlands, one of the few concentrations of this species in the state.

There are numerous abandoned mines in the High-
lands, many of which are currently being used as 
winter bat hibernacula. The federally listed en-
dangered Indiana bat and the state special concern 
eastern small-footed bat are known to occur in the 
Highlands.  Regionally rare ridge top communities 
include rocky summit grasslands and pitch pine-
oak-heath rocky summit community.  The great 
species diversity that is supported throughout the 
region is an indication of the high ecological value 
of the areas habitat.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
The most significant threat to the Highlands is the continued conversion and fragmenta-
tion of the areas forests and wetlands.  Conservation efforts should focus on maintaining 
the unfragmented forest core from the glacial moraine north to the Hudson and across the 
Hudson to the Connecticut border with linkages on forested ridges to the Delaware River 
to the south.  Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
This area is similar to the USFWS New York-New Jersey Highlands Significant Habitat 
Complex.  The physiographic region of the Highlands follows the boundary between 
the Highlands and Piedmont physiographic provinces on the southeast, and between the 
Highlands and the Appalachian Ridge and Valley provinces on the northwest.  Though the 
physiographic region proper extends from the Delaware River in New Jersey northeast 
across the Hudson River to Candlewood Lake in southwestern Connecticut, the extent of 
the Highlands biodiversity area described in this document is confined to the study area. 
The Highlands province is distinguishable from the adjoining provinces by differences in 
geology, topography, and geomorphology (landforms).

Hudson River Estuary and Tidal Wetlands

 

 

 

 

 

         

 
Site Description:
The Hudson River Estuary contains significant freshwater and brackish tidal wetlands, as 
well as other riverine and estuarine habitats, islands, riparian zones, and important tribu-
taries.  These habitats support a high diversity of fish, birds, and mammals.  Tidal wet-
lands exist along the entire reach of the estuary and include some of the rarest ecological 
communities in the state.  Some of the islands contain significant upland communities, 
including pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit and hemlock-northern hardwood forest.

The Hudson River extends 152 miles from the mouth of the river to the Federal Dam near 
Troy, New York.  The width of the river ranges from 1/6 mile to 2.5 miles and the surface 
area at high tide is 82,000 acres.  Intertidal wetlands and subtidal shallows consist of 26% 
or 21,200 acres of this surface area. 

77

The Hudson River Estuary has a four-foot tidal pulse that extends all the way to Troy.  
In years with average amounts of precipitation falling in typical seasonal patterns, the 
leading edge of salt water is held downriver between the Tappan Zee and Yonkers during 
spring runoff.  As runoff slackens during the summer, the salt front pushes northward to 

Newburgh Bay, and during droughts to Poughkeepsie and 
beyond.  Because of the changing levels of salinity and 
tidal nature of the Hudson River, species assemblages 
vary by locality and overall diversity is high.  In addition 
to the tidal riverine community, brackish intertidal mud-
flats, brackish tidal marsh, freshwater intertidal mudlflats, 
freshwater intertidal shore, freshwater tidal marsh, and 
freshwater tidal swamp all together form a matrix down 
the shoreline of the river.  Brackish, or lower salinity, 
tidal wetlands are regularly flooded by ocean water that 
has been diluted by freshwater from upstream.  These

wetlands are found south of the Highlands down to Manhattan.  Freshwater tidal swamps 
found along the Hudson are globally rare.  Saltwater marshes are now rare in New York 
Harbor, although they once extended for thousands of acres around Manhattan.  Patch 
communities within the tidal portion of the Hudson River include calcareous shoreline 
outcrop, cliff community, and tidal creek. 

The Hudson River Valley is broad and gently rolling with a bedrock of shale, siltstone, 
sandstone, limestone, and dolostone.  Most of these are relatively soft sedimentary rocks 
and easily eroded.  These bedrock formations have been eroded away to low plains with 
the Hudson River flowing through them.  Most of the surficial deposits near and within 
the river are modern river channel deposits.  River margins are made nutrient rich as the 
river carries fresh sediment from the uplands and deposits them along the rivers banks.  

Site Location: 
The Hudson River Estuary is the portion of the Hudson River extending from the Battery 
at the southern tip of Manhattan north to the Federal Dam in Troy, New York.

Ecological Significance:
The Hudson River is one of the most extensive freshwater tidal river systems in the north-
eastern United States.  The tidal communities found here are regionally and globally rare.  
Wetland habitats are the cornerstone of the Hudson River Estuary ecosystem because 
they play a critical role as nursery grounds for fish and shellfish species, nesting sites and 
migration stops for birds, and sources of nutrients to the food chain.  The marshes and 
tidal flats of the Hudson River Estuary contribute essential nutrients to aquatic and ter-

79

restrial food webs that extend throughout the river system and far into the Atlantic Ocean.  
Besides serving as important habitats, the wetlands that border the Hudson River Estuary 
perform other valuable services.  Pollutants are filtered from water that flows through 
fresh and saltwater marshes, and these same wetlands buffer valuable real estate from 
floodwaters and storm surges.  Estuarine plants also help to prevent erosion and stabilize 
the shoreline.

Estuaries are transition zones from inland freshwater ecosystems to saltwater ecosystems 
found in coastal environments.  Estuarine environments are among the most productive 
on Earth, creating more organic matter each year than comparably sized areas of forest, 
grassland or agricultural land.  Several measures of the importance of estuaries are that 
more than half of the commercial fish species caught globally and more than 75% of 
Americas commercial fish catch spend part of their lives in an estuary.  Key commercial 
and recreational species such as striped bass, bluefish, and blue crab depend on nursery 
habitat in the Hudson River Estuary.

During recent field surveys, populations of the state-endangered plant Hudson River wa-
ter nymph were rediscovered in a freshwater intertidal mudflats community.  The entire 
global range of this plant is limited to the Hudson River Valley; therefore, it is considered 
endemic.  This is the only endemic plant to all of New York State.  Other globally rare 
plants still found in the Hudson Rive Estuary include estuary begger-ticks, Longs bit-
tercress, and salt-meadow grass.  Rare animals of the Estuary include shortnose sturgeon, 
Atlantic sturgeon and Atlantic needlefish.  Harbor seal are periodically reported and the 
Northern diamondback terrapin is present in some of the lower Hudson River Estuary 
tidal marshes.

The Hudson River Estuary ecosystem has been stressed by multiple activities such as the 
discharge of raw sewage that leads to high bacterial counts and low dissolved oxygen 
levels, landfilling that has destroyed valuable wetlands, cooling water intakes that kill 
millions of fish, and food webs contaminated by toxic chemicals.  Among fish of com-
mercial, recreational and ecological importance, the American shad, Atlantic sturgeon, 
river herring (blueback herring and alewife), American eel, and largemouth bass are in 
decline.  Little is known of the status of blue crab, smallmouth bass, and other species.  
Striped bass have increased over the last few decades, but fishing pressure in the Estuary 
and along the Atlantic coast must be carefully managed or it could lower current popula-
tion levels.  Although tidal wetlands have been protected by state and federal law since 
the 1970s, erosion, sea level rise, changes in salinity, introductions of nonnative species 
and other factors have caused changes in wetland plant and animal communities over 
time.

Further description of the Hudson River Estuary is divided below into general salinity 
habitat zones based on average annual salinities.
 
	 Lower Hudson River Estuary

80

The lower Hudson River Estuary zone from Manhattan to Stony Point is an area that 
approaches marine habitat characteristics, having very strong semi diurnal (twice 

daily) tidal currents and moderate salinities.  This section of the Hudson is gener-
ally the zone of greatest mixing of river water and ocean water. The lower Hudson 
is rich in benthic resources and provides a significant nursery for fish populations.  It 
is an important source of food resources for populations of wintering and migratory 
birds.  This stretch of the river has significant concentrations of wintering waterfowl, 
especially canvasback. Other important animal species living in this area include 
osprey, fiddler crabs, blue crab, and diamondback terrapin.  There are several region-
ally significant plants that occur in the Lower Hudson including the state endangered 
cylindrical headed bulrush.  Piermont Marsh is a sizeable intertidal brackish marsh 
community and one of the largest undeveloped wetland complexes on the Hudson.  It 
includes the northernmost occurrence of salt marsh species on the Hudson.  Because 
it represents an exemplary ecological community type, Piermont Marsh has been 
designated as one of four sites that make up the Hudson River National Estuarine 
Research Reserve.

	 Mid-Hudson River Estuary

The productive and regionally significant Mid-Hudson River estuary is generally 
fresh water in winter and has low salinity in summer.  This section encompasses 
regionally significant spawning migratory and nursery habitat for anadromous, estua-
rine, and freshwater fish, important winter feeding and roosting areas for the federally 
listed threatened bald eagle, and globally and regionally rare brackish and freshwater 
tidal communities and plants.  The open water and tidal wetlands in this reach are 
spawning and nursery habitats and a migratory pathway between the upper and lower 
estuary for anadromous and resident fish. 

The habitat contains many unusual features, including deep tidal river habitat that is 
a rare ecosystem type in the eastern United States, and an important winter foraging 
area for the bald eagle. The numerous creeks and 
tidal brackish and freshwater marshes in this stretch 
serve as breeding, nursery, and migration corridors 
for fish and wildlife.  Iona Island supports important 
winter roost sites for bald eagles that feed in the ad-
jacent deepwater segment of the river.  Iona island 
also has several rare plants including Bushs sedge, 
slender knotweed, and pinweed.  Con Hook Marsh 
is a small, brackish tidal marsh with several rare 
plants, including cylindrical headed bulrush, spongy 
arrowhead, necklace sedge, and pinweed.  Con Hook Marsh is also an important win-
tering area for waterfowl, especially mergansers. Constitution Marsh is a freshwater 
to brackish tidal marsh and is the largest undeveloped brackish tidal wetland on the 
Hudson River.  It is a prime breeding and feeding area for marsh nesting birds.

	 Upper Hudson River Estuary

The open water, tidal wetlands, and tributaries in the upper reach of the Hudson are 
regionally important fish spawning habitats for anadromous fish, especially Ameri-
can shad, striped bass, Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon, and provide habi-
tat for all life stages of resident freshwater species.  The numerous creeks and tidal 

81

freshwater marshes in this stretch serve as breeding, nursery, and migration corridors 
supporting waterfowl, shorebirds, herons, raptors, and passerine birds. Regionally 
and globally rare tidal communities include freshwater tidal swamp, freshwater tidal 
marsh, freshwater intertidal mudflats, and freshwater intertidal shore.  The Hudson 
River water nymph, a state-endangered endemic plant, was recently rediscovered in a 
freshwater intertidal mudflats community from the Upper Hudson River (Howard et 
al. 2002).

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
All activities that degrade water quality in the Hudson River Estuary adversely affect the 
fish and wildlife that use this habitat for various life functions.  Water pollution by chemi-
cal or oil spills; excessive turbidity; sedimentation; and other point and nonpoint source 
pollution degrade the quality and function of the estuarine habitat.  Toxic contamination 
has long term effects on the safety of food and the health of consumers due to bioaccu-
mulation and biomagnification.  Water quality improvement efforts are needed throughout 
the estuary.  Upgrades to sewage treatment facilities, control of point and nonpoint source 
pollution, and contaminant trackdown and clean-up should continue to be major goals 
throughout the watershed.  Full restoration of the hydrologic continuum (wetlands and the 
river), especially hydrologic connections under the existing railroad beds, and restoration 
of riparian corridors along the tributaries to the Hudson, will increase available upland 
habitat, improve the quality of aquatic habitat in the tributaries, and reduce sediment and 
nutrient input into the Hudson.  Improvement of habitat complexes for animals requiring 
both wetlands and uplands should be encouraged.  Additionally, measures to conserve 
and educate the public about submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds located through-
out the estuary should be continued and expanded.

Location Description:
	 Lower Hudson River Estuary

This area is also identified by the USFWS as the Lower Hudson River Estuary Sig-
nificant Habitat Complex.  The area for the lower Hudson River follows the shores 
of the Hudson River from the tip of Battery Park, Manhattan, generally referred to as 
river mile 0, north to the Stony Point area river mile 41. The area includes all riverine 
and estuarine habitats, including open water and tidal wetlands in this stretch of the 
river.

	 Mid-Hudson River Estuary

This area is identified by the USFWS as the Mid-Hudson River Estuary Significant 
Habitat Complex.  The mid Hudson River estuary follows the shores of the Hudson 
River from Stony Point, river mile 41, to Poughkeepsie, river mile 75.  The significant 
area includes all riverine and estuarine, open water and tidal wetland habitat in this 
stretch of the Hudson.

82

	 Upper Hudson River Estuary

This area is identified by the USFWS as the Upper Hudson River Estuary Significant 
Habitat Complex.  The upper Hudson River estuary follows the shores of the Hudson 
River from Poughkeepsie at river mile 75 to the northern inland extent of the tidal 
Hudson River at Troy Lock and Dam, river mile 152. The significant area includes 
the tidal freshwater portion of the Hudson River, including all riverine, open water, 
and tidal wetlands in this stretch of the river as well as supratidal wetlands and some 
adjoining uplands and nontidal wetlands. The significant area also includes the lower 
portion of major and minor tributaries feeding into this part of the Hudson, up to the 
first impediment to fish passage in each tributary.

Hudson Valley Limestone and Shale Ridges

Site Description:
The Hudson Valley Limestone and Shale Ridges consist of the limestone areas that paral-
lel the New York State Thruway, mainly to the east of the Thruway, and the parallel shale 
ridge west of the Thruway.  This area is a regionally significant geologic feature that con-
tains habitats that support several rare mammal, amphibian, reptile, bird, and plant spe-
cies.  The area covers about 127,000 acres in a curved line about 54 miles long and 5.6 
miles wide at its widest point.  The northern section consists of the band of cliffs known 
as the Helderberg Escarpment and the southern section extends along the Potic Mountain 
ridge. 

Significant natural communities in 
this area include red maple-black-
gum swamp, vernal pool, chestnut 
oak forest, Appalachian oak hickory 
forest, and pitch pine-oak-heath 
-rocky summit.  In addition, small 
patch communities in the Potic range 
to the south include shale cliff and 
talus community and shale talus 
slope woodland.  In other areas, 
calcareous cliff community, calcare-
ous talus slope woodland, red cedar 
rocky summit, and rocky summit 
grassland communities have been documented in the upland and bedrock outcrop locali-
ties.  In the lowlands, floodplain forest, limestone woodland, maple-basswood rich mesic 
forest, red maple-hardwood swamp, and silver maple-ash swamp have been documented.

The bedrock of the Hudson Valley Limestone and Shale Ridges mainly consists of lime-
stone from the early to mid Devonian Period (approximately 400 million years ago).  
These rocks were produced when the area was covered by shallow seas and fossils are 
not uncommon.  The limestone acts as a buffer to neutralize the increased acid precipita-

83

tion in the region, a helpful characteristic to the local flora and fauna.  The boundaries of 
this area also include Ordovician (450 million years ago) deposits of shale, sandstone, 
siltstone, and limestone.  The surficial deposits consist mainly of till and river and lake 
bottom deposits in the lowlands, with bedrock in the uplands.
 
Site Location: 
The Hudson Valley Limestone and Shale Ridges are about 11 miles west/southwest of 
Albany.

Ecological Significance:
The limestone bedrock supports a wide variety of diverse communities, many of which 
are rare in New York State and the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  These include calcar-
eous cliffs, calcareous talus-slope woodlands, and red cedar rocky summits.  The shale 
ridge contains what may be the best examples of 
shale cliffs and talus slopes in the region.  Several 
sizable limestone caves occur on the Helderberg 
Escarpment where eight species of bats are known 
to occur including the federally endangered Indi-
ana bat.  The limestone cliffs are one of only two 
areas in the Hudson River Estuary corridor to sup-
port a winter hibernaculum for the Indiana bat (the 
other is the Rosendale Limestone Cave Complex) 
and also includes three sites for the state special-

upland sandpiper, sedge wren, and least bittern.  One waterfowl concentration area is 
present within this area.

Numerous species of amphibians and reptiles are commonly found within the Hudson 
Valley Limestone and Shale Ridges, including the spotted salamander and several other 
rare species such as Jefferson salamander, blue spotted salamander, and wood turtle.  Nu-
merous rare plants occur in the area, including the smooth cliff brake, rams head ladys 
slipper, and American ginseng.  More rare plant species are found throughout the rich 
uplands and lowlands.
 
Conservation issues and recommendations:
Habitat conversion as a result of suburban expansion is of greatest concern in the largely 
unprotected lands of this significant area. Exploring opportunities for conservation agree-
ments (easements or acquisition) that ensure the continued existence of the least disturbed 
and unfragmented examples of the state-rare communities listed above is recommended. 
Exotic species including garlic mustard and tree-of-heaven are common throughout the 
area. Management efforts to reduce and prevent the spread of these exotic species in the 
highest quality areas are recommended. Implementing the Helderberg Escarpment Plan-
ning Guide will help to protect the unusual resources found here. More complete surveys 
of the karst areas, escarpment wetlands, and other significant habitats are needed.
 
 
Location Description:
This area is a modification and extension of the USFWS Helderberg Escarpment Signifi-
cant Habitat Complex.  The northern portion of the habitat area consists of the Helderberg 
Escarpment itself and the land both above and below the escarpment within approximate-
ly 3 miles of the escarpment face from Dormansville north to the Albany Schenectady 
County line.  South of the Helderberg Escarpment, the site extends along the Potic Moun-
tain ridge and extends as far south as Marion Mountain. From the Potic Mountain Ridge, 
the site follows south along the limestone escarpment to the Schoharie Turnpike.  It 
proceeds east and then south on Hans Vosenkill Road until just north of Catskill and then 
east on Huckleberry Hill Road a short distance to Route 9W.  It proceeds south on 9W 
until Saugerties and continues south to Esopus Creek. It follows Esopus Creek west and 
south to Plattekill Creek, west on Plattekill Creek to the shale escarpment.  It follows the 
western shale escarpment line north to the Helderberg Escarpment.

 

 

Jamaica Bay and Beaches

Site Description:
Jamaica Bay and Beaches encompass important breeding and juvenile nursery habitat 
for fisheries as well as year round foraging areas for waterfowl, shorebirds, and colo-
nial nesting waterbirds. The extensive salt marsh and upland islands in the bay provide 
nesting habitat for gulls, terns, waterfowl, and herons; foraging and roosting habitat for 
shorebirds and waterbirds; upland sites for grassland bird nesting and foraging areas; and 
butterfly concentration areas. This is an extremely valuable area for resident and migra-
tory fish and birds and for other wildlife and plant populations.

85

Site Location: 
Jamaica Bay is located on the southwestern tip of Long Island in the boroughs of Brook-
lyn and Queens, New York City and the town of Hempstead, Nassau County. The bay 
connects with Lower New York Bay to the west through Rockaway Inlet and is the 
westernmost of the coastal lagoons on the south shore of Long Island.  Although not 
considered part of the Hudson River Estuary Watershed, this site is included in this report 
due to its presence in the conservation area, which is defined as the counties bordering the 
Hudson River Estuary.

Ecological Significance:
The location of Jamaica Bay and the rich food resources found there make it a region-
ally important area for fish, wildlife, and plants. This area contains species dependent 
on coastal and beach habitats found nowhere else within the Hudson Estuary corridor 
conservation area. Its geographic location acts to concentrate marine and estuarine spe-
cies migrating between the New York Bight portion of the North Atlantic and the Hudson 
Raritan Estuary. Shorebirds, raptors, waterfowl, landbirds, and various migratory insects 
are concentrated by the coastlines in both directions. These migratory species are further 
concentrated by the surrounding urban developed land into the remaining open space 
and open water of Jamaica Bay. The waters and sediments of Jamaica Bay are a highly 
productive and regionally significant habitat for finfish, shellfish, and wildlife.  The rare 
Northern diamondback terrapin uses habitats throughout the bay for nesting and feeding. 
Jamaica Bay is also one of the most important migratory shorebird stopover sites in the 
region, especially during fall migration (July to November).

Conservation issues and recommendations:
Land-use conflicts in this area result from the high-density human population. Recre-
ational overcrowding, shoreline hardening, extensive dredging and dredge soil deposi-
tion, and invasive species are all a result.  The bay continues to be threatened by poor wa-
ter quality, loss of upland and wetland buffer, and disturbance of habitat areas. Virtually 
the entire watershed of Jamaica Bay is urban, developed land and the bay receives sub-
stantial pollution from a variety of point and nonpoint sources. Recommendations include 
directing recreational use away from areas determined to be most biologically sensitive, 

86

developing monitoring pro-
grams to study the impacts of 
recreation and invasive species 
on biodiversity, and exploring 
opportunities to mediate the 
impacts of recreation and other 
activities. Additionally, efforts 
to improve the water quality 
in the bay and throughout the 
watershed should be strongly 
encouraged. Recommendations 
for restoring the water quality, 
habitat quality and quantity, and 
species diversity are detailed in

ment of Environmental Protection.  Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
This area was also identified by the USFWS as the Jamaica Bay and Breezy Point Sig-
nificant Habitat Complex.  This significant area includes the entire Jamaica Bay estuarine 
lagoon, part of Rockaway Inlet, and the western part of the Rockaway barrier beach. The 
area generally follows the shoreline of Jamaica Bay and includes most of the tidal creeks 
and undeveloped upland areas adjacent to the bay; these serve as buffers for the bay, as 
upland habitat, and as existing and potential restoration sites. This complex also contains 
the western end of the Rockaway barrier beach and the Marine Park/Plumb Beach area 
just to the west of the main body of Jamaica Bay to include beach and dune habitat for 
nesting bird and rare plant species.

Narrows

Site Description: 
The Narrows is notable for its wading colonial bird rookeries, island heronries, and 
significant coastal habitats. 

Site Location: 
The Narrows constitutes the westernmost section of Long Island Sound between Hell 
Gate, at the convergence of the Harlem and East Rivers, and the Hempstead Sill, a 
major shoal area extending north and south across the Sound from Matinecock Point 
on Long Island, near Glen Cove, Nassau County, to the New York Connecticut line. 
This significant area also includes a small area of southwestern coastal Connecticut in 
the vicinity of Greenwich.  Although not considered part of the Hudson River Estuary 
Watershed, this site is included in this report due to its presence in the conservation area,

Ecological Significance:
The principal habitat types of significance in this area are offshore islands with colonial 
wading bird rookeries; rocky intertidal areas; and tidal wetland areas consisting of vari-
ous combinations of associated salt and brackish marshes, mudflats, tidal creeks, and 
protected open water coves.  The wetlands systems in this area are diverse and relatively 
undeveloped, with tidal rivers and creeks, salt marshes, mudflats, freshwater marshes 
and shallow water areas occurring over the general area.  The three north shore bays, 
Little Neck Bay, Manhasset Bay, and Hempstead Harbor, are collectively among the 
most important waterfowl wintering concentration areas in the surrounding region.  Sand 
beaches in this area provide essential nesting habitat for piping plover, a federally listed 
threatened species, least tern, and Northern diamondback terrapin.  Marshlands associated 
with the bays are valuable feeding and nesting areas for green backed heron, clapper rail, 
American black duck, and are feeding areas for several species of wading birds.  North 
and South Brother Islands are the site of the largest black crowned night heron colony in 
New York State.  The wetlands along the mainland in this area provide important nest-
ing habitat for several species of special emphasis in the region, including green backed 
heron, yellow crowned night heron, American bittern, Canada goose, American black 
duck, and clapper rail.  Several regionally rare plants occur at Pelham Bay Park, includ-
ing purple milkweed, persimmon, Bushs sedge, globose flatsedge, slender blue flag, 
short fruited rush, yellow giant hyssop , and woodland lettuce.
 
Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Industrial, commercial, and residential expansion in the extremely urbanized environ-
ment of the Narrows continues to influence existing natural ecosystems and fish and 
wildlife populations. In spite of this, many important and regionally significant areas 
persist, although their future appears uncertain without intensive and coordinated protec-
tion, management, and environmental safeguard programs in place.  Protective measures 
should be taken, whether by regulation, zoning, planning, cooperative agreements, or ini-
tiatives such as the National Estuary Program, to restore, maintain, enhance, and protect 
the aquatic, terrestrial, insular, and benthic habitats of the Narrows, the major bays, and 
the lesser embayments and coves along the mainland.  Protective measures will ensure 
that these areas continue to support the regionally significant populations of waterfowl, 
fish, and colonial breeding birds that utilize and depend upon these habitats.  Additional 
inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
This area was also identified by the USFWS as the Narrows Significant Habitat Com-
plex.  The site corresponds approximately with that of the Narrows proper, and includes 
most of the mainland wetlands and nearshore waters and islands of western Long Island 
Sound and portions of the East River within this area. Specifically included in this area 
are the three major bays on the north shore of western Long Island, in Nassau and Queens 
Counties: Little Neck Bay, Manhasset Bay, and Hempstead Harbor, which are recognized 
here as an interrelated complex of regionally significant fish and wildlife aquatic habitats. 
Although the overall area of this complex is considerably more extensive than the indi-
vidual significant habitat areas identified in the East River section and the Westchester/
Bronx and Connecticut shorelines of the Narrows, these habitats were felt to be linked, or 
potentially so, and thus were included together.

Neversink River

Site Description:
The Neversink River flows into the Dela-
ware River and contains globally signifi-
cant populations of the dwarf wedgemus-
sel, as well as other rare mussels including 
the brook floater and alewife floater.

Site Location: 
The Neversink River runs along the west 
side of the Shawangunk Mountains joining the Delaware River near the tri-state junction 
of New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.  Although not considered part of the Hud-
son River Estuary Watershed, this site is included in this report due to its presence in the 
conservation area, which is defined as the counties bordering the Hudson River Estuary.

Ecological Significance:
The Neversink River is most notable for its exemplary occurrences of the globally rare 
dwarf wedgemussel.  It also contains several significant communities including flood-
plain forest, and shale cliff and talus community.  Regionally rare animal species in this 
area include the bald eagle and timber rattlesnake.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Changes in water level, flow, or chemistry in the Neversink River would likely impact the 
rare mussel populations found there.  A management plan for the lower Neversink River 

89

involving federal, state, county, and local agencies and organizations focused on protect-
ing the habitat and water quality for mussels would be beneficial. The lower Neversink 
River, floodplain, and adjacent uplands need to be protected through a variety of mecha-
nisms, including acquisition and easements, to prevent impacts to the globally significant 
mussel population. The water quality, water flow, and water chemistry must be main-
tained, and appropriate flows from the Neversink Reservoir must be maintained. Research 
should be conducted to determine host fish and other life history requirements of all the 
rare mussel species in the lower Neversink River. Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description: 
The Neversink River significant area follows the Shawangunk Ridge significant area 
boundary on the east down to the boundary for the Delaware/Moungaup rivers significant 
area.  The Neversink River significant area conservatively follows route 209 on the west 
and extends up the western reach of the Neversink for approximately 3.3 miles.

Palisades

Site Description:
The Palisades include regionally rare talus slope and traprock communities, and is an 
important open space within the urbanized zone along the Hudson River Estuary.  It is 
used by migratory and resident raptors and songbirds.  The entire Palisades area consists 
of a 12,000-acre region in Rockland County and adjacent New Jersey and of this, 8,600 
acres fall within New York State.  In New York, the Palisades biodiversity area is about 
18 miles long and 1.5 miles wide at its widest point. 

The Palisades is a narrow ridge along the western 
shoreline of the Hudson River consisting mainly of 
upland, outcrop, cliff, and talus slope communities.  
The matrix communities consist of Appalachian oak-
hickory forest and chestnut oak forest.  Good quality 
rocky summit grassland patch communities have 
been documented.

About 195 million years ago, liquid magma pushed 
into a large fracture somewhat near the surface of 
the earth.  The magma cooled to form a very resis-
tant rock called diabase.  Because the magma filled 
a relatively horizontal fracture at the current ground 
surface, this intrusion is termed a sill.  The Pali-
sades Sill forms an east-facing cliff 120-130 meters 
thick.  The diabase appears with column-like struc-
tures formed when the magma cooled, contracted 
and subsequently cracked in the regular column-like

pattern.  On both sides of the Palisades Sill are reddish brown mudstones and sandstone 
that formed about 200 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the land.  For todays 
plants, animals, and communities, the diabase offers a very different rock type than most 
in the region to grow on.  This igneous rock offers cliff habitats and the potential for com-
munities quite different from the standard, calcareous substrate common in the region.

Site Location:
The Palisades is a narrow ridge located along the western shoreline of the Hudson River 
Estuary in southeastern New York, at the northern end of the metropolitan New York City 
region.

Ecological Significance:
The Palisades biodiversity area supports several significant ecological community types 
and numerous regionally significant species including several federally and state listed 
species. One of the highlights of this area includes the 1998 discovery of the globally rare 
basil mountain mint as well as seven other rare plants.  Fewer than 25 populations are 
known worldwide for the basil mountain mint and Torreys mountain mint and two of the 
largest remaining populations exist within this area of the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  
Prior to this find, basil mountain mint was last seen in New York in the late 1800s. 

Talus slope communities and rocky summit grassland communities occur in only a few 
locations in the region. The talus slope community provides dens and basking areas 
for regionally rare reptiles including the northern copperhead and five lined skink. The 
only known remaining occurrence for the Allegheny woodrat in the region occurs in the 
Palisades.  The Allegheny woodrat was thought to be extirpated from New York, until a 
survey and trapping effort in 2001 found the only known extant woodrat population in the 
state (Howard et al. 2002).  The Palisades Ridge is also important as a migratory corridor 
and nesting area for raptors and songbirds. The hawk watch each fall at Hook Mountain 

91

counts about 25,000 hawks, as well as other 
landbirds and waterfowl, and constitutes the 
largest fall counts of any hawk watch in New 
York State.  The relatively unfragmented forest 
habitats on the Palisades also support popula-
tions of two declining turtle species, the wood 
turtle and the eastern box turtle.

Conservation issues and recommendations:
Several management issues on the public lands of this area could be improved to reduce 
threats to many of the rare plant occurrences. Invasive exotic species and natural suc-
cessional processes threaten to crowd and overtop rare species populations. Misplaced 
bike trails and hiking trails can threaten to trample and erode sensitive populations. Trail 
re-routing, exotic species removal, and brush clearing activities should be designed to 
benefit rare species populations. The Allegheny woodrat population is also threatened, 
probably by parasitic roundworm. Active protection of the Allegheny woodrat may be 
necessary, including trapping and removing raccoons, inoculating rats against round-
worm, and reintroducing them to historically occupied habitats. Additional inventory 
work is needed.

Location Description:

This area was also identified by the USFWS as the Palisades Significant Habitat Com-
plex.  The eastern portion of the Palisades significant area follows the west shore of the 
Hudson River from just south of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jer-
sey, north about 22 miles to Haverstraw, New York, and then west another 4 miles. The 
inland (western) portion of the site parallels the river boundary; the two encompass the 
open space on the Palisades Ridge.  The significant area ranges from about 0.6 mile to 1.5 
miles in width.

Rensselaer Plateau

 

 
Site Description:
The Rensselaer Plateau contains a diverse mix of wetland and upland communities that 
are more common in northern New York and New England, including spruce-fir swamp, 
shallow emergent marsh, sedge meadow, hemlock-northern hardwood forest and spruce 
flats.  The large, contiguous nature of this area provides habitat for a number of large-
ranging mammals and forest-interior bird species. 

The Rensselaer Plateau is an expansive plateau of contiguous high elevation northern 
forests.  In comparison with the nearby more mountainous Taconic range, the topography 

92

is rolling and contains many swamps and lakes among the forests.  The area is 121,236 
acres.  The Little Hoosic River drains the northeast side of the Rensselaer Plateau, while 
the Poesten Kill, Quacken Kill, and tributaries to Kinderhook Creek (Black Brook, Roar-
ing Brook, Black River, West Brook) flow from the west and southern portions. 

Matrix forest in the Rensselaer Plateau contains hemlock-northern hardwood forest com-
munities (including two large blocks of 2,400 and 2,500 acres) and spruce flats com-
munity.  Many patches of other community types exist within the matrix forests, such 
as hemlock-hardwood swamp, spruce-fir swamp, shallow emergent marsh, and sedge 
meadow.  Other patch communities include talus cave community, calcareous talus slope 
woodland, oligotrophic dimictic lake, inland poor fen, dwarf shrub bog, black spruce-
tamarack bog, and maple-basswood rich mesic forest.

The majority of the Rensselaer Plateau is covered by glacial till from the last glaciation.  
Till usually consists of a mixture of material ranging in size from large boulder-sized 
rocks to very fine silt and clay.  Nearly the entire area (including all the bedrock outcrops) 
consists of a bedrock of Rensselaer Graywacke, a dark gray, clay-rich sandstone or fine-
grained conglomerate.  This one region is the only remnant of this rock type, and was 
originally formed about 540 million years ago, during the early Cambrian Period.  This 
ancient sedimentary rock is more resistant to erosion than other rocks to the west, result-
ing in the higher elevations on the Plateau.  Other major bedrock components include 
shale and quartzite.

From a biological perspective, all of the bedrock components tend to have good buffering 
capabilities against acid deposition.  The extensive surficial deposits of till produce rocky 
soils that are difficult to farm, likely one of the main reasons the forests remain so exten-
sive on the Rennselaer Plateau.  However, the mix of silts, clays and sands in till deposits 
result in good quality soils for the natural communities.

Ecological Significance:
Rensselaer Plateau represents one of the larger unfragmented forested areas of high qual-
ity in the region.  The ecological significance of this area relates to its large, contiguous 
forest and wetland habitats and the species 
dependent on these habitats, as well as the 
diversity of plants, communities, and animals 
unique to this region.  Area-sensitive animals 
found in this area include a variety of forest 
interior songbirds as well as large mammals 
that occur in low densities such as moose, 
black bear, bobcat, fisher, and river otter.  In 
addition to the continuous and relatively un-
fragmented northern forests, the area contains 
Rensselaer Plateau meadow.  Photo by Andy Finton.
regionally significant boreal wetland commu-
nities that occur within the forests.  Examples include dwarf shrub bog, sedge meadow, 
spruce-fir swamp, and inland poor fen.  The acidic ponds within the Rensselaer Plateau 
contain some of the best populations of Farwells water milfoil, a state-threatened aquatic 
plant, and algae-like pondweed, an aquatic plant recently moved to the NY Heritage Pro-
gram watch-list.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations: 
The conservation of habitat corridors that link intact forest blocks is of particular impor-
tance. Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
The Rensselaer Plateau significant area is similar to the Rensselaer Hills ecozone (Will et. 
al 1982).  This area encompasses the expansive plateau of contiguous and largely road-
less high elevation forests (approximately 180 square miles).  Elevations start at 700 feet, 
however, most of the area is above 1,000 feet.  

         

 

Rosendale Limestone Cave Complex

Site Description:
This area encompasses a series of extensive abandoned limestone mines that serve as 
critical habitat for several native bat species.  Wetlands within the area provide habitat for 
a number of animal species, including the state-listed endangered northern cricket frog.   
The state-rare plant species goldenseal occurs in this significant area.

The Rosendale Limestone Cave Complex occurs right over a lower Devonian limestone 
formation called the Rondout Formation.  This formation contains a very high quality 
limestone once used in extensive production of an early type of cement and was mined 
extensively.  The resulting mine shafts and rooms are the caves the bats use as hiber-
nacula.  The surficial geology consists mostly of limestone outcrops (e.g., bedrock), but 

94

some areas also have deposits of glacial till, outwash sand and gravel, and one small 
kame deposit.  These glacial deposits facilitate the wetland communities where cricket 
frogs occur.

concern, the eastern small-

this area are among the top 
15 sites in the world for 
hibernating populations of 
both Indiana bat and small-
footed bat.  In 2000, a 
new bat hibernaculum was 
discovered that contained 
more than 10,000 Indiana 
bats as well as eastern 
small-footed bats.  The 
population estimate makes

the top 10 sites in the U.S. for Indiana bats (Howard et al. 2001).   These caves also serve 
as regionally significant hibernaculum for several other bat species including long-eared 
myotis, little brown bat, eastern pipistrelle, and big brown bat.  All species combined, this 
area has the second largest total number of hibernating bats of any site in New York State.

The wetland communities in this area are also notable for supporting regionally signifi-
cant animal species.  Principle among them is the state listed endangered northern cricket 
frog.  The northern cricket frog was discovered during 2000 surveys at two locations and 
was until then thought to be extirpated from the wetlands (Howard et al. 2002).  Another 
rare animal reported from the area is pied-billed grebe.  A population of goldenseal, a 
plant often collected and used within herbal  medicinal products, was also recently found.  
This plant is usually located within a forested landscape on top of calcareous soils and 
near wet seeps or adjacent to wetlands.  Discovery of the population raises speculation 
that additional rare plants of calcareous bedrock might exist within the area.

95

Significant natural communities of the area include calcareous talus slope woodland, 
hemlock-hardwood swamp, limestone woodland, red maple-hardwood swamp, and 
hemlock-northern hardwood forest.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Land protection may be implemented through a variety of methods including acquisition 
(on a voluntary, willing seller basis), conservation easements, cooperative land agree-
ments, and outreach.  Additional inventory work is needed, particularly for winter bat 
hibernacula.

Location Description: 
The Rosendale Limestone Cave significant area is defined by the limestone physiographic 
belt.  It is bounded by the Thruway (I-87) to the east, the Rosendale town line to the west,

Shawangunk Kill/Shawangunk Grasslands

Site Description:
The Shawangunk Kill is a relatively undisturbed Hudson River Estuary tributary. It flows 
to the northeast between the Shawangunk Ridge and Wallkill River, which drains into the 
Hudson River.  Its relatively low nutrient levels, cool water, and lack of a major water 
control structure allow the lower Shawangunk Kill to support a regionally rare biologi-
cal community.  This site includes Shawangunk grasslands, immediately adjacent to the 
Shawangunk Kill, that are important for a 
number of grassland bird species.  Addi-
tionally, wetlands within this area sup-
port a number of rare plant species.  This 
biodiversity area covers 11,470 acres and 
encompasses approximately 14 miles of 
the lower Shawangunk Kill with a 0.62 
mile buffer on either side of the river and 
an enlargement near the middle to include 
the Shawangunk grasslands (formerly the 
Galeville Military Airport).

Shawangunk Kill.  Photo by Paul Jensen.
The bedrock underlying the area easily erodes (Normanskill shale and Austin Glen 
formation), explaining the relatively low elevation and general lack of topography.  In 
accordance, surficial deposits cover all the bedrock.  In addition to glacial till, deposits of 
fine sediments (silt and clay) from proglacial lakes and variable sediments from the cur-
rent river channel are present.

Site Location: 
The Shawangunk Kill is a tributary of the Wallkill River and its headwaters originate on 
the east slope of the Shawangunk Ridge. It is located in the Wallkill River valley and runs 

96

along the base of the east slope of the Shawangunk Ridge about 12.4 miles west of the 
Hudson River, and about 62 miles northwest of New York City.

Ecological Significance:
The Shawangunk Kill supports high diversities of fish and 
mussels, unusual for the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  
Six species of freshwater mussels have been identified in 
this stretch of the river, including the globally rare swol-
len wedge mussel.  Populations of the brook floater which 
were previously found in several areas are likely in decline 
(Howard et al. 2002). Wood turtle occurs in riparian habitat 
of the Shawangunk Kill and its tributaries. The Shawan-
gunk Kill supports a number of rare plants including the 
largest known populations of beakgrass east of the Missis-
sippi. 

The Shawangunk grasslands support several rare or declin-
ing grassland bird species, including Henslows sparrow, 
northern harrier, upland sandpiper, short eared owl, long 
eared owl, and rough legged  hawk.  Other grassland nesting birds likely use this site as 
well. The grasslands are an important raptor concentration area in the Hudson River Val-
ley.  Rare plants found in wetlands of the area include Franks sedge.

Henslows sparrow.  

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Excessive water withdrawals could have significant impacts on flow and water quality. 
Water withdrawals from the Shawangunk Kill would be detrimental to the rare species 
found there. Longer low flow periods would result in increased warming of the water, 
reduced dissolved oxygen, increased concentration of nutrients and silt, and changes in 
the patterns of sediment deposition.  As much as possible, further development or agricul-
tural use should be directed at least 1,000 feet from the river.  Agencies and conservation 
organizations should work with farmers and landowners to improve stream bank buffer-
ing through fencing, plantings of native shrubs and trees, and other methods.  The local 
communities along this stretch of the river are encouraged to develop a regional plan to 
reduce impacts on the Shawangunk Kill.  Additional studies of the flora and fauna of this 
stretch of the river, as well as of other locations in the upper Shawangunk Kill and other 
locations in the Wallkill River Valley, are needed. 

97

Agreements and easements should be developed with willing farmers to delay the first 
cutting of hay to avoid impacts on grassland nesting birds.  Agricultural BMPs that 
minimize negative impacts on grassland birds should be developed cooperatively with 
producers.  Educational and outreach programs that promote the coexistence of sound 
farming practices and grassland bird conservation should be provided to the agricultural 
community.  This biodiversity area may provide an opportunity for state, federal and lo-
cal conservation partners to coordinate their efforts.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service is 
developing a management plan for the Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge 
which will include strategies for preserving wildlife habitat values, protecting rare, threat-
ened and endangered species, and providing priority public uses on refuge lands.  

Location Description:
The biodiversity area was also identified by the USFWS as the Shawangunk Kill Signifi-
cant Habitat Complex. The Shawangunk Kill includes the lower 18 river miles segment 
from the village of Pine Bush downstream to its junction with the Wallkill River and a 
buffer 0.62 mile (1 kilometer) on both sides of the river. The site also includes the Dwaar 
Kill from the village of Dwaarkill downstream to its junction with the Shawangunk Kill.  
This area is intended to encompass the regionally rare animal and plant populations as-
sociated with the river and a buffer zone to protect the river corridor.

Shawangunk Ridge

Site Description:
The Shawangunk Ridge contains an 
unusual diversity of plant communi-
ties and a high diversity of associ-
ated plant and animal species.  The 
high diversity in the area is due in 
part to the wide range of topography 
and substrate.  The area contains 
communities that range from wet-
land to ridgetop, slope, and cliff.  
The forest habitats are important as 
a migration corridor for raptors, other migratory birds, and wide-ranging mammals.  An 
adjacent portion of the lower Neversink River just west of the Shawangunk Ridge is 
included in this biodiversity area, because of the importance of the ridge in maintaining 
high water quality and the presence of globally significant mussel populations (see the 
Neversink River description).

The entire boundary of the Shawangunk Ridge extends into New Jersey and encompasses 
more than 205,000 acres.  The portion within the Hudson River Estuary Watershed is 
over 87,000 acres in area and 44 miles long and 7 miles wide in its widest part.  Streams 
within the area drain into Rondout Creek to the north and Shawangunk Kill and the 
Wallkill River to the south.  The southern portion of the Shawangunk Ridge drains away 

98

from the Hudson River Estuary Watershed to the Neversink River to the north, which in 
turn flows into the Delaware River.

The forest matrix for the majority of the Shawangunk Ridge is chestnut oak forest.  This 
community covers more than 38,000 acres.  Here, the most abundant tree species are 
chestnut oak and red oak and the most abundant shrub species are huckleberry and moun-
tain laurel.  Large patch communities include hemlock-northern hardwood forest, and 
pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit.  Hemlock-northern hardwood forest communities 
tend to occur in the cool, moist ravines and depressions in the uplands of the Shawangunk 
Ridge.  The most abundant tree species tend to be hemlock and chestnut oak, with hem-
lock also dominating in the understory.  In contrast, the pitch pine-oak-heath rocky sum-
mit communities occur in dry, well-drained uplands and rock outcroppings of the ridge.  
The largest patch of this community covers 4,000 acres.  Pitch pine is the most abundant 
tree species, while scrub oak is the common tall shrub.

The Shawangunk ridge consists mainly of a bedrock type called the Shawangunk Con-
glomerate.  This is made of quartz sand and pebbles held together strongly by a quartz 
cement.  Because of the high percentage of quartz, this sedimentary rock is very resistant 
to erosion.  Thus, as the other, less resistant, nearby formations were eroded away, this 
formation remained as a striking, very steep-sided ridge.  Deposits on top of the bedrock 
are generally thin layered or even nonexistent.  As a result, much of the surficial geology 
is simply considered bedrock.  Glacial deposits, such as till and kame deposits are also 
present.
 
Site Location: 
The Shawangunk Ridge is located in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province of 
southeastern New York, about 56 miles northwest of New York City.

Ecological Significance:
The Shawangunk Ridge is the northernmost ridge in the Appalachian Ridge and Val-
ley physiographic province.  There is a high diversity of vegetative communities on the 
ridge containing species and communities typically found north of this region alongside 
species and communities typically found to the south or restricted to the Coastal Plain. 
This results in an unusual area where many regionally rare plants and animals are found 
at or near the limits of their ranges. Other rare species found in the habitat area are those 
adapted to the harsh conditions on the ridge.

Regionally significant upland communities in this area include chestnut oak and mixed 
oak forest, pine barrens including globally and state rare dwarf pine ridges, hemlock 
northern hardwood forest, state rare pitch pine-oak-heath rocky summit and cliff and talus 
slope and cave communities. A variety of wetlands, small lakes, streams, and bogs occur 
in the area and contain regionally significant communities including state rare pitch pine 
blueberry peat swamps, globally rare inland Atlantic white cedar swamp, and  red maple 
swamps.  Numerous vernal pools are found on the ridge as well.  These pools and their 
surrounding habitats support a variety of amphibian species, including regionally rare 
salamanders such as the spotted salamander, Jefferson salamander, and longtail salaman-
der. 

Timber rattlesnake, northern copperhead, and eastern hognose snake occur at several 
locations, as does five-lined skink.  Turtles inhabiting the ridge include spotted turtles in 
the ponds and wetlands, and wood turtles in wooded riparian habitat all along the ridge.  
The diversity of relatively unfragmented, undisturbed, deciduous and coniferous forests 
and wetlands on the ridge support a variety of nesting bird species and also serves as an 
important corridor for many migrating species.  There are several area-sensitive, large 
mammal species in the area including black bear, bobcat, and fisher.

Rare species found in the 
area include state-rare 
dragonflies and arrowhead 
spiketail, which are found 
in the wetland communi-
ties.  Other unusual ani-
mals include rare moths, 
peregrine falcon, and a 
bat hibernaculum.  Recent 
findings include a new site 
for the state-threatened 
fern, mountain spleen-
wort, and two sites for the 

Bobcat.  Photo courtesy of Cornell University.

state-threatened Appalachian sandwort (Howard et al. 2002).  Within New York, known 
populations of the mountain spleenwort are restricted to the cliff faces of the Shawangunk 
Ridge.  The arctic rush is also located on these cliff faces.  The beautiful flowering shrub 
rhodora is fairly common between Lake Awosting and Sams Point and these are the best 
areas in the state to see rhodora.

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Habitat conversion of land on the ridgetops would fragment both the forest and wet-
land habitats and reduce the suitability of the ridge to support its rare plant and animal 
populations.  Deer grazing of rare plants such as the small whorled pogonia and broom 
crowberry could be a threat if the density of the deer population increases.  Radio towers 
could present a hazard to migratory raptors and other landbirds. Hemlock wooly adelgid 
threatens the hemlock forests on the ridge. Although much of the land on the top of the 
ridges is protected, ways to prevent habitat fragmentation on the remaining areas should 
be explored. Significant habitat areas along the periphery of the publicly owned lands in 
the northern Shawangunks should be identified and considered for inclusion into adjacent 
protected areas.  Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
This area is similar to the USFWS Shawangunk-Kittatinny Ridge Significant Habitat 
Complex.  The Shawangunk Ridge significant area includes the entire section of the ridge 
from its northernmost extent at the junction of Rondout Creek and the Wallkill River in 
the town of Rosendale, Ulster County, New York. The area includes only the portion of 
the ridge within New York; the ridge continues south via the Kittatiny ridge through New 
Jersey across the Delaware River at the southern end of the Delaware Water Gap into 
Pennsylvania and along the Appalachian Mountains, but that part of the ridge is beyond 
the geographic scope of this study. The boundaries of the significant area on either side 
of the ridge are generally based on the break in slope between the ridge and the adjacent 
valleys.

Staten Island Greenbelt

Site Description:
The Staten Island Greenbelt contains 4 of the 5 occurrences of the globally rare 
serpentine barrens community on Staten Island and is an important area for rare plant 
species.  Additionally, the area contains a large forest block.

Site Location:
Located on Staten Island in the far southeastern corner of New York State.  Although not 
considered part of the Hudson River Estuary Watershed, this site is included in this report 
due to its presence in the conservation area, which is defined as the counties bordering the 
Hudson River Estuary.

Ecological Significance:
Although the majority of Staten Island is densely populated, there are numerous locations 
that contain rare species and rare communities, including the Staten Island Greenbelt. 
Staten Island is the southernmost land in New York State and contains many species and 
communities that are found nowhere else 
in the state, but are more common in the 
mid-Atlantic states to the south. The geol-
ogy and coastal position of Staten Island 
add to its unique properties. Staten Island 
contains the only occurrence of serpen-
tine bedrock in New York State, and the 
island occurs at the southern terminus of 
the most recent glaciation. This significant 
area includes four of Staten Islands five 
occurrences of the globally rare serpentine

barrens community. This area also pos-
sesses the largest, more or less contiguous forested area on the Island. Found here is a 
large and diverse example of the southern variant of oak-tulip tree forest. This area has 
historic records for the globally rare adders-mouth, as well as 13 other occurrences of 9 
rare plant species.

Conservation issues and recommendations:
The growth of woody vegetation and the resulting succession of serpentine barrens to 
closed canopy communities, threatens their viability and the rare plants that utilize this 
habitat. Management plans for this area should include fire management or other means 
(cutting, brush hog, etc.) to keep woody vegetation from developing and to maintain the 
native grasses and forbs. Development of unprotected open space threatens the occur-
rences at this site, as do clearing or tree cutting operations, alterations in the hydrology of 
wetland areas, and invasive exotic species.

Additionally, management plans should allow the remaining native forest areas to mature 
without cutting and should include monitoring and removal activities of exotic species in 
high priority sites. Open space on Staten Island receives intense development pressure. 
While some forested tracts have recently been acquired by the state, additional forested 
lands, as well as wetlands, need further protection based on NY Heritage Program inven-
tories and information from local biologists.  Additional inventory work is needed.

102

Location Description: 
The Staten Island Greenbelt significant area is similar to the New York City Parks and 
Recreation boundary.  The area encompasses a relatively contiguous forest in a suburban/
urban environment.

Taconic Ridge

Site Description:
The Taconic Ridge encompasses large areas of contiguous, high quality, northern hard-
wood forest underlain by complex metamorphic bedrock.  It serves as a principle wa-
tershed and recharge area for numerous rich fens and associated rare plant and animal 
species.  The Taconic Ridge extends nearly 60 miles along the eastern edge of New York 
State and is about 12 miles wide at its widest point.  Within New York, it covers approxi-
mately 78,700 acres.  Running along the divide between the Hudson and Connecticut 
River Watersheds, 53,600 acres of this area fall within the Hudson River Watershed.

Hemlock-northern hardwood forest and Appalachian oak-hickory forest are the most 
common matrix forest types.  Patch communities include pitch pine-oak-heath rocky 
summit, acidic talus slope wetland, and rocky summit grassland. 

The Taconics contain high topographic variability that enhances diversity of community 
types and associated species.  About 450 million years ago (the Ordovician Period), col-
liding continents caused the formation of a mountain chain the size of the Himalayas in 
eastern New York and western New England.  These mountains have eroded to what is 
now the Taconic Range.  The bedrock geology consists of various types of metamorphic 
rocks; mainly deformed sedimentary rocks that were pushed up from the ocean floor 
from the advancing continent.  These bedrock formations have less buffering capabili-
ties against acid rain and other pollutants than the limestone-rich areas of the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor.  Communities in the Taconics are likely to be more sensitive to 
chemical changes in atmospheric deposition.  In the upper elevations of the Taconics, the 
surficial geology is mapped as bedrock, the lower elevations are generally considered to 
be glacial till.  Although till is very rocky, the range of particle sizes (clay and silt all the 
way to boulders) and the recent exposure/creation of these particles increases the quality 
of the soil for the plant communities.

Site Location:  
The Taconic Ridge is east/southeast of Albany and runs along the border between New 
York and Massachusetts.

Ecological Significance:
The Taconic Ridge is notable for its large, contiguous northern hardwood forests.  It is 
one of the best occurrences of northern hardwood forest communities in the region.  It 
serves a diverse population of resident and migratory bird species as wintering and breed-
ing habitat and as a migratory corridor.  The area also supports regionally rare plant and 
animal species.  Examples include bog turtle and timber rattlesnake, and the globally and 
state rare Ogdens pondweed and Hills pondweed. 

During recent biological surveys, a spruce-northern hardwood forest community, which is 
uncommon in these mountains, was documented on the summit of Berlin Mountain, and 
a relatively large beech-maple mesic forest was documented at The Knob in New Leba-
non and Canaan (Howard et al. 2002).

Conservation Issues and Recommendations:
Habitat fragmentation, especially on ridge tops, has been increasing in recent years.  Pro-
tective measures for these ridge tops need to be explored.  This area also needs additional 
inventory work.

Location Description:
The Taconic Ridge significant area is similar to the Taconic Mountains ecozone (Will et. 
al. 1982).

10-15 rare plant occurrences.

Conservation issues and recommendations:
Mowing activities and woody plant growth threaten rare plant occurrences. Mowing out-
side of flowering and fruiting season and preventing tree growth from shading plants will 
maintain rare plant occurrences. Invasive exotic species including garlic mustard, tree-of-
heaven, purple loosestrife, and common reed threaten communities and rare species and 
should be reduced and/or removed where feasible.  Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
The Van Cortlandt Park significant area corresponds to the New York City Parks and

Ward Pound Ridge Reservation

Site Description: 
Ward Pound Ridge Reservation supports exemplary populations of a variety of amphib-
ians, reptiles, and insects (in particular butterflies and moths).  This area consists of a 
3,900-acre region in eastern Westchester County.  Just east of the Cross River Reservoir, 
the Cross River flows through the northern section of the area.

Ward Pound Ridge is part of the geologic region called the Manhattan Prong.  The rocks 
of the Manhattan Prong were tightly folded and metamorphosed during the Taconian 
mountain forming process about 450 million years ago.  An especially weather-resistant 
bedrock formation, called poundridge gneiss, forms the backbone of this significant areas

hill.  Other resistant rock, Fordham gneiss, occurs in the remainder of the area, with less-
resistant Inwood marble occurring right along the edge.  Because the Ward Pound Ridge 
mainly consists of upland, hilly terrain, the main surficial bedrock features are glacial till 
and rock outcrop.

Ecological Significance:
Ward Pound Ridge is a critical area in the region supporting a diverse community of 
moths, butterflies, and other insects.  A notable example is the tiger spiketail dragonfly, 
which occurs in fewer than ten sites across New York State. Ward Pound Ridge also 
contains regionally significant community occurrences including chestnut oak forest and 
a rich variant of red maple-hardwood swamp.  Rare plant occurrences include spotted 
pondweed, featherfoil, and rattlebox.

This area is a known breeding site for the state-protected Kentucky warbler.  Watch list 
species that have been documented include the northern copperhead and four state-listed 
special concern species: marbled salamander, worm snake, hognose snake, and the east-
ern box turtle.  Natural communities are relatively disturbed in the area, mainly from deer 
overbrowse.  However, some of the wetlands are of good quality and one upland commu-
nity, an acidic talus slope woodland, was recently discovered and transcribed as a signifi-
cant community (Howard et al. 2002).
 
Conservation Issues and Recommendations: 
A burgeoning deer population is a major threat to rare plant species and communities and 
wildlife species associated with these communities.  Invasive plant species in this area are 
also a significant threat to native, rare plant species and subsequent insect populations. 
A management program is needed to effectively control the deer population and control 
invasive plant species.  Additional inventory work is needed.

Location Description:
The Ward Pound Ridge Reservation significant area corresponds to the Westchester 
County Parks boundary for the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation.

PART III: Conservation Strategies and Recommendations

Introduction
The strategies and recommendations presented in this section are intended to provide 
a long-term direction for the conservation of biological diversity in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor.  This section outlines general conservation program areas (biological 
inventories and ecological research, land management and environmental quality, and 
education) and strategies.  Program areas and specific strategies are designed to address 
the primary threats to biodiversity in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.

The Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program recommends an approach that utilizes a 
broad range of conservation tools.  No new regulatory programs are recommended in this 
report.  Instead, partnerships and outreach to landowners, local governments, and public 
land managers are the basis of the conservation strategy. 

As conservation strategies are implemented, continued ecological research and biological 
inventories will help to support science-based land management and improvements in 
environmental quality.  Efforts to prevent future degradation are a particular emphasis 
of the program.  Biodiversity outreach projects can utilize the programs biodiversity 
data and information to provide educational and training opportunities for citizens, local 
communities, land trusts, and other conservation organizations.

This report provides a foundation for coordinating actions and developing partnerships, 
a critical element influencing the future success of conservation efforts in the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor.  It creates a mechanism for individual, community, organization, 
and government involvement and identifies and directs attention to biodiversity, and 
threats to biodiversity.  In this respect, recommended conservation strategies and actions 
encompass multiple scales from local to regional.
 
Addressing Threats to Biodiversity
Addressing threats to biodiversity was considered a critical priority as conservation 
strategies were developed.  Threats were identified through a series of meetings involving 
the programs steering committee.  From this process, key conservation program areas 
and specific strategies and actions were developed to address these threats (Table 3). 

Deriving conservation strategies that target primary threats to biodiversity ensures 
that conservation effort is directed where it is most needed and where it will have the 
greatest benefit.  Many actions can be developed from these conservation strategies, and 
organizations are encouraged to work cooperatively to develop and implement specific 
actions. Importantly, most strategies can be applied to significant habitats and biodiversity 
areas, and to both public and private lands.

Conservation Program Areas & Strategies
The section below is organized from general to specific.  Broad conservation 
program areas (biological inventories and ecological research, land management and 
environmental quality, and education) are described, followed by specific activities within 
those program areas that address threats to biodiversity.  Recommended strategies are 
provided at the end of each section. 

Program Area:
Biological Inventories & Ecological Research

In a broad sense, strategies addressing the need to increase our overall knowledge 
about biodiversity and how to manage for it include identifying key areas where 
information is lacking, promoting research opportunities, and seeking new sources of 
funding.  It is important that conservation practices are based on current information.  

108

Continuing applied research efforts and inventories that update our knowledge of the 
occurrence of species and habitats will provide an objective basis for biodiversity 
conservation.  Research and inventories provide data and information necessary for 
developing techniques that will improve land management and environmental quality, 
and the information base for education and outreach activities.  Scientific information 
is also needed to develop conservation and management priorities that maximize the 
effectiveness of limited funds.

	 Biological Inventories

Inventories of common and rare plants, animals, and ecological communities (habi-
tats) within the uplands and wetlands of the region should be continued and expand-
ed.  Biological inventories provide the foundation for other program areas and allow 
us to establish baseline information and monitor trends and accomplishments. 
Adequate knowledge of the abundance and distribution of elements of biodiversity 
is the foundation of a successful conservation program.  The Gap Analysis Project 
and the New York Natural Heritage Program have been integral to the early success 
of the Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program.  Using different methodologies, 
each program has inventoried the presence and distribution of species and ecologi-
cal communities. In addition, the Natural Heritage Program tracks the quality of 
biodiversity element occurrences. Two large atlas projects have provided additional 
inventories.  The NYS Amphibian and Reptile Atlas Project collected data for all spe-
cies of amphibians and reptiles occurring in the wild in New York for the period 1990 
- 1999. The information has been mapped at the county, town and USGS topographic 
quadrangle scale and in the future more specific location data might be available.  
The Breeding Bird Atlas is a comprehensive, statewide survey of breeding birds that 
reveals the current distribution of breeding birds in New York.  The Breeding Bird At-
las was expanded and refined in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  The Atlas 2000 
Project began in January 2000 and completed in 2005.  The first Breeding Bird Atlas 
was conducted from 1980 to 1985.  These research and inventory programs allow us 
to assess the extent and quality of biodiversity occurrences and illustrate where con-
servation is most needed and would be most effective.

While the inventory programs above operate within the entire Hudson River Estu-
ary corridor, intensive inventories at the local scale have also been completed and 
are underway.  Examples include a town-wide assessment of biodiversity resources 
completed for the Town of East Fishkill (Dutchess County) by Hudsonia, Limited 
(Figure 13); and the identification of landscape components important for biodiversity 
conservation within selected towns of the lower estuary corridor by the Metropolitan 
Conservation Alliance (a program of the Wildlife Conservation Society).  Both of 
these projects support municipalities and towns in carrying out biodiversity conserva-
tion planning.

Stevens and Broadbent (2002) for descriptions of habitats. The habitat mapping project 
was funded by the Marilyn Milton Simpson Charitable Trusts.

Accurate and current inventory data establishes a baseline for monitoring and evalu-
ation programs, supports local planning for economic growth and biodiversity, facili-
tates scientific management of public lands, and provides the information base upon 
which outreach and educational programs should be developed. To date, inventory 
data have been used for the identification of significant biodiversity areas within the 
Hudson River Estuary corridor, which in turn have been used for providing recom-
mendations for New York States Open Space Plan.  At another level, inventory ef-
forts have been used to provide baseline data for town planning processes. 

Two primary sources of existing inventory data, the New York Natural Heritage Pro-
gram and the New York Gap Analysis Project, are described next.

New York Natural Heritage Program Approach
The New York Natural Heritage Program is a cooperative effort between The Nature 
Conservancy and NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). Its 
purpose is to facilitate conservation of New Yorks distinctive biodiversity by identi-
fying, documenting, and mapping the presence and distribution of rare and exemplary 
elements of biodiversity. The Heritage Program also provides information to the pub-
lic about rare species and habitat conservation strategies in New York.

The NY Natural Heritage Program considers all plant and animal species as well 
as ecological communities to be elements of biodiversity. It therefore takes both a 
species-focused and natural community approach to identifying the presence and 
distribution of rare and common elements of biodiversity. Inventory efforts begin by 
compiling lists of all vulnerable native species and classifying all ecological com-
munities in New York State. Sources used to develop the species lists and the com-
munity classification include scientific and popular literature, museum collections, 
state records, and the advice of knowledgeable professionals. The Heritage Prgram 
conducts focused field surveys to discover new rare species populations and signifi-
cant ecological communities, and to verify and update existing information on known 
occurrences.

The NY Natural Heritage Program maintains an Active Inventory List of plant and 
animal species that it monitors in New York State. This list contains most species that 
have fewer than 50 populations in the state or that are considered highly vulnerable 
to extirpation. It also contains species for which only historical collections are known 
and species thought to be extirpated from the state. For ecological communities, The 
Heritage Program actively inventories all rare natural community occurrences as well 
as common natural communities that are of exceptional quality.

Each surveyed element (i.e., species or ecological community) is ranked on state and 
global rarity scales. State rarity ranks describe the abundance and distribution of a 
species and are a measure of its risk of extirpation from New York. The global rar-
ity rank is an indication of the vulnerability of a species or community throughout its 
entire range and is more or less a measure of an elements risk of extinction. These 
ranks help land-use decision makers understand just how rare and imperiled a given 
species or ecological community is. In addition, each rare species population and 
exemplary ecological community occurrence is ranked for its quality. Quality ranks 
consider size, condition, and landscape context and are an indication of the viability 
of a given species or community occurrence.

All rare species and significant ecological community occurrences are delineated us-
ing a Geographic Information System (GIS) and entered into the Heritage Program 
biodiversity database. This database, and the methods used to populate it, are consis-
tent with similar databases maintained by Natural Heritage Programs throughout the 
United States, Canada, and Central and South America. This collaborative network of 

111

databases is coordinated by NatureServe (formerly the Association for Biodiversity 
Information), and allows for rapid analysis and interpretation of rare species patterns 
throughout the Hudson River Watershed, New York State, and North America.

The NY Natural Heritage Program recently completed inventory and analysis of 
biodiversity element occurrences within 18 biodiversity areas (Figure 4) of the 
10 counties bordering the estuary north of New York City (Howard et al. 2002).  
Previous inventories covered selected areas within the towns (Finton et al. 1999) and 
counties (Finton et al. 2000) bordering the Hudson River Estuary.  The inventory 
results demonstrate the importance of the Hudson River Valley to the overall 
biodiversity of New York State.  The surveyed 18 biodiversity areas contained 
36% of the rare animal taxa, 27% of the rare plant taxa, and 54% of terrestrial and 
palustrine (wetland) communities known in the state.  The results also indicate the 
importance of the significant biodiversity areas within the Hudson River Estuary 
corridor.  The surveyed biodiversity areas contained at least one locality for 85% of 
rare animal taxa, 76% of rare plant taxa, and almost all of the ecological communities 
known to occur in the Estuary corridor.  Several of the notable survey results 
include rediscovery of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) in the Palisades 
(previously thought to be extirpated from the state) and rediscovery of two plants 
that have not been observed in New York State for over 50 years: the Hudson River 
water-nymph (Najas guadalupensis var. muenscheri), and basil mountain mint 
(Pycnanthemum clinopodioides).  These surveys expand and refine our knowledge 
and understanding of rare species and all natural communities and make the Heritage 
Program database a more powerful information and conservation tool for all New 
York State citizens.

In the future, priority areas of the Hudson River Estuary corridor will continue 
to be surveyed by the Heritage Program.  The Heritage Program has developed 
informational products that will help to interpret their extensive survey information 
for local and regional decisionmakers.

New York Gap Analysis Project Approach
The New York Gap Analysis Project (Smith et al. 2001) is part of a national effort to 
inventory and digitize into a computer-based, geographical information system (GIS) 
the distribution of plant and animal species and plant assemblages that are an integral 
component of national biodiversity.  The gap analysis approach compliments that of 
the Heritage Program inventory by expanding the community focused approach to the 
entire landscape.  In New York, a statewide vegetation map was produced delineat-
ing the distribution of native ecological communities.  This map was developed from 
satellite images showing the distribution of distinct vegetation assemblages.  The as-
semblages were classified using a system unique to the Hudson Valley and adapted to 
conform to the National Vegetation Classification Standard (Federal Geographic Data 
Committee 1997) organizational hierarchy.  The classification system was developed 

112

using multiple field data sources and then cross-referenced with Ecological Com-
munities of New York State (Reschke 1990).  The resulting land cover map offers the 
advantage of being able to identify and predict native ecological communities across 
New York State where field data are lacking.  The land cover classification was then 
combined with wildlife-habitat relationship models to predict the distribution of ani-
mal species.  Unprotected areas of biodiversity were identified by digitally overlaying 
maps of public and private conserved lands with maps of predicted species richness.
The gap analysis methodology should be useful for guiding future research, biological 
inventories, and land-use planning at the regional scale.  

f the terrestrial vertebrate animals, 272 of 308 species were predicted to have 10% 
or less of their distribution within protected lands, including all of the regions am-
phibians.  Twenty-three species were not predicted to occur at all on protected lands, 
including the Eastern mud turtle and 22 bird species.  Most of these bird species nest 
in grassland or water related habitats.  The gap analysis results show that a large por-
tion of the higher elevation lands in the Hudson River Estuary corridor are in public 
ownership (68% of land above 2,297 ft or 700 m), while the lower elevation lands (ar-
eas below 1,641 ft or 500 m) are predominantly in private ownership with no known 
plans for permanent biodiversity protection.  At least 12% of the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor is public land.  Habitat types poorly represented in protected areas 
(areas managed to stay in a primarily natural condition) include evergreen wetlands, 
deciduous wetlands, emergent wetlands (wet meadows), shrub swamp, successional 
hardwoods, successional shrub, Appalachian oak-pine forest and open water (lakes 
and streams). 

The products created by the Gap Analysis Project can be used to further analyze land 
use patterns and biodiversity distribution.  Using data generated by the gap analysis, 
human population growth models were developed to predict where areas of biodi-
versity are at risk from encroachment in the Hudson River Estuary corridor (Smith et 
al. 2004).  Gap results are also helping to analyze the contribution of public lands to 
biodiversity conservation in the Estuary corridor.

Other Approaches
Other groups use different approaches to assess biodiversity in the Hudson River 
Valley.  For example, the Wildlife Conservation Societys Metropolitan Conservation 
Alliance tracks focal taxa, groups of organisms that are not necessarily rare or 
endangered, but that provide data on ecosystem health, conditions, and environmental 
change. 

Through use of the Biodiversity Assessment Manual for the Hudson River Estuary 
Corridor, Hudsonia, Ltd. encourages landowners and decision makers to conduct 
large-scale and site-specific biodiversity assessments to identify ecologically 
significant habitats, natural communities, and species of plants and animals of 
particular conservation concern.

In summary, employing a variety of scientific approaches to inventorying and moni-
toring biodiversity at multiple scales will produce the most useful and reliable infor-
mation.
 

Strategies for biological inventory:

o  Address key areas where data are lacking;
o  Expand understanding of less known taxonomic groups;
o  Conduct biological inventories that improve our understanding of 

both common and rare species and habitats, environmental health, and 
responses to environmental change; 

o  Develop and implement methods for establishing conservation priorities; 
o  Combine data sets collected at multiple scales.

	 Ecological Research & Monitoring

An important component of conserving biodiversity in the Hudson River Valley is 
development of an ecological research and monitoring program.  Ecological research 
helps us to understand how wildlife populations and habitats are maintained and how 
humans can interact with both to maintain environmental quality.  Ecological research 
and monitoring will help to alert scientists and citizens to regional and site-specific 
threats affecting the health of the environment in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  
Because the principal threats to biodiversity have been identified, a program designed 
around evaluating and monitoring the impact of these threats and the effectiveness of 
management strategies should be implemented.

Ideally, this program would also help to identify plants, animals, and ecological 
communities that are at risk before they become threatened or endangered.  As men-
tioned previously, the NY Natural Heritage Program, NY Gap Analysis Program, 
NYS Amphibian and Reptile Atlas Project, and the NYS Breeding Bird Atlas Project 
and other programs have established baseline data that could be extremely useful for 
future ecological research and monitoring.  Monitoring programs are also an excellent 
opportunity to foster community and volunteer group participation.

Ecological research directly feeds into the development of land management strate-
gies.  Land managers and planners require an understanding of the cumulative effects 
of human activities and natural processes and the possible consequences of planning 
and management activities. Researchers could examine how various land manage-
ment activities affect the health of wildlife populations, humans, and ecosystems and 
use the findings to develop conservation strategies.

An important aspect of biodiversity that is often overlooked is the maintenance of 
ecological processes that provide environmental quality, such as clean water, ground-
water recharge, or the breakdown and processing of potentially toxic substances by 
natural systems.  The results of research on these subjects can help planning agencies 
and managers work proactively to prevent degradation of environmental quality and 

115

the loss of biodiversity.  Ecological research should be carried out at multiple scales 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, from individual sites to the landscape level.  It 
is important to understand how the entire Hudson River Estuary ecosystem, which 
includes both terrestrial and aquatic components, supports and is supported by biodi-
versity.

Ecological research and monitoring in the Hudson River Estuary corridor should 
focus on 4 priority areas, including:

1. The status of endangered, threatened, and special concern species
The New York Natural Heritage Program has conducted intensive biodiversity inven-
tories in the Hudson River Valley since 1998, collecting data on rare plants, animals, 
and ecological communities and documenting threats to these resources.  These in-
ventories have provided important baseline data that might be used to assess changes 
in the populations and habitats of rare species and communities over time. 

Monitoring of rare species and communities should occur on a regular schedule that 
is defined during the planning stages.  As a companion to this effort, ecological re-
search could be conducted to study the effects of land-use change on populations and 
communities of interest.  The effects of habitat management on rare species should be 
monitored (for example, the use of prescribed burning at the Shawangunk Grasslands 
National Wildlife Refuge for rare grassland birds) and the relationships between land-
scape configuration and population sustainability explored. 

2. Ecosystem health and integrity
Complex linkages exist between biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human health.  
Monitoring of vertebrate and invertebrate indicator species can be useful for assess-
ing ecosystem health (the functioning and performance of ecosystems).  Studies of 
species health can also provide early indications of threats to human health.  Com-
mon indicator organisms include amphibians, butterflies, and dragonflies.  In general, 
choosing the appropriate indicator species involves balancing the dual requirements 
of practicality and accuracy.  An indicator must, by definition, be relatively well 
known or at least easy to study, but it also must be informative, accurate, and reliable.  
Indicator species should be correlated through research with their associated endpoint.

Indicators that are linked to many other parts of the ecosystem are valuable to track 
since their decline can result in the declines of numerous species.  Indicators of eco-
system stress should respond rapidly to the stress if they are to be used as early warn-
ings.  Other stress indicators may not respond as quickly, but may be useful if they 
accurately and clearly indicate the particular impact.  A wider range of criteria can be 
met using multiple indicators.

An exploratory study should be initiated to assess the feasibility of monitoring indi-
cator species in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Such a study should investigate 
which threats to biodiversity can be monitored through the use of indicator species, 

116

the most appropriate species to monitor, cost, duration, methods, and long-term fund-
ing opportunities.

Several large-scale efforts have been made to document the occurrence of ecologi-
cal communities, both common and rare, in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  
However, knowing where a species occurs is not the same as knowing why it occurs 
there.  To be effective, ecological communities (i.e., habitats) must be conserved at 
their natural size scale and in adequate condition and configuration to insure that they 
contain all their associated species.  For conservation purposes, it is critical that the 
ecological processes and disturbances that sustain a particular ecological community 
are operating within their natural range of variation.  Ecological systems with high 
biological integrity are able to absorb small perturbations and to prevent them from 
amplifying into larger disruptions in ecosystem function.  They are also better able to 
return to an original level of productivity and species composition following distur-
bance.  A natural community with high integrity exhibits resistance, resilience, and 
persistence over centuries.  Continued research and consideration of landscape func-
tion and ecological integrity are necessary to ensure the sustainability of biodiversity 
and environmental quality.

3. Species potentially impacted by contaminants
Bioaccumulation of contaminants through the aquatic food chain affects a number of 
wildlife species in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Particularly vulnerable are a 
number of bird (bald eagle, heron) and mammal species (otter, mink) that prey upon 
fish and shellfish in the estuary.

 

A sampling program should be established that measures contaminant levels in a 
selected suite of wildlife species at regular time intervals.  Research in this area for a 
Natural Resource Damage Assessment has been initiated, however, additional re-
search that links contaminant levels to the health and reproduction of these species is 
also needed.

4. Invasive, exotic, and overabundant species and their impacts on native flora  
and fauna
There are over 115 exotic species in the Hudson River Valley, and more enter the 
region each year.  Research focused on the use of remotely-sensed satellite imagery 
could be useful for collecting baseline information on the abundance and distribution 
of some invasive, exotic, and overabundant plants in the Hudson River Estuary cor-
ridor.  This research could be used in evaluating control of invasive species over time.  
Initial progress has been made on developing techniques for monitoring and predic-
tion of purple loosestrife distribution.  Coupled with this effort is the development of 
a management plan for purple loosestrife in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  The 
research on purple loosestrife may serve as a model for other invasive exotic plants.

Program Area:
Land Management & Environmental Quality

Land management has a large affect on environmental quality in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor.  Land management strategies can address a variety of threats to 
biodiversity and can be implemented at multiple levels.  In particular, the federal, state, 
and local governments are important landholders and strategies to conserve biodiversity 
on public lands can be implemented.  The management of public and private lands 
should be actively coordinated, if adjoining landowners/managers are willing to conserve 
habitats across their boundaries.

Land management deals directly with habitat conservation measures that can be 
implemented at all levels, including acquiring land for conservation and public use 
on a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis, negotiating conservation easements, and 
providing land stewardship incentives to landowners.  Conservation easements and land 
stewardship incentives are a cost-effective way of promoting biodiversity conservation 
while maintaining private land ownership.  Examples of land stewardship incentives 
may include monetary compensation (e.g. USDA Conservation Reserve Program 
(CRP), Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP)), tax breaks, or public recognition 
for stewardship.  Land management strategies can be developed for larger landholders 
in particular. For example, in the Hudson River Valley, agricultural land represents a 
primary source of open space and can be an important source of biodiversity potential.  
Agricultural and forestry best management practices can both benefit these operations and 
support biodiversity conservation. 

Specific areas that address land management should include: 

 

	 Management Recommendations for Public Lands:

The state and federal government own a substantial amount of land in the Hudson 
River Valley (Figure 5) and make many important land-use decisions influencing 
wildlife and habitat diversity.  These public lands protect significant habitats and 
currently contain some of the best remaining intact landscapes in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor.  Municipal parks and non-profit conservation lands are also vital for 
biodiversity, providing not only locally important habitat, but also stopovers for mi-
grating birds and butterflies.  In suburbanizing areas such as the Hudson River Valley, 
parks and preserves can be crucial for biodiversity conservation.

Some of the larger areas under state ownership include State Forests and Preserves 
and Wildlife Management Areas managed by the NYSDEC and State Parks and His-
toric Sites managed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic 
Preservation (OPRHP) (Table 4).  These areas are particularly important because, in 
part, they serve to provide a mechanism for some level of protection (though variable) 
for plants and animals and their habitat.  The New York State Department of Trans-
portation and Office of General Services also own and manage a significant amount 

118

of land in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, and offer various levels of biodiversity 
protection.  Additionally, the United States Federal Government manages approxi-
mately 5% of the total public lands in the Hudson River Valley. Coordination of 
management activities among state, federal, and private landowners to meet regional 
conservation goals should be a high priority.

State public lands fall under a variety of different types or categories, each with a 
different mandate and capacity for protecting sensitive plant and animal species and 
critical habitats.  These variable mandates generally relate to differences in priorities 
given to public use and access.  Because of this, conservation priorities and subse-
quent policies are different for State Forests, State Parks, State Wildlife Management 
Areas, Multiple-Use Areas, transportation rights-of-way, and other public lands.  In 
spite of these differences, however, some broad-based recommendations can be made 
that transcend different public use and natural resource management mandates. 

Informed land management will assure that biodiversity conservation is considered 
in decisions affecting the future use of public and non-profit conservation lands.   The 
following recommendations promote the conservation of biodiversity in the Hudson 
River Estuary corridor while recognizing the importance of public access to biodiver-
sity.
 
 

119

 

Strategies for public land management:

incorporate them into site management plans;

o  Identify opportunities to conserve biodiversity on public lands and 
o  Tailor policies and programs to consider the protection and conservation 
of biological diversity.  State agencies should make efforts to incorporate 
conservation considerations into their planning, particularly where it 
has never been a consideration.  State agencies that have traditionally 
considered some level of conservation should re-evaluate and re-examine 
conservation policy and actions to include and emphasize biodiversity 
conservation;

o  State and Federal lands should serve as a model for private land owners, 
demonstrating the value of biodiversity and providing examples of sound 
conservation approaches;

o  Actively coordinate the management of public and private lands, 

concentrating on those lands that are adjacent to each other or lie across 
political boundaries;

o  Allow or mimic natural processes including natural disturbance regimes 
o  Retain natural land cover. When possible and compatible with 

such as fire and flooding;

management objectives, maintain lands in a natural state, minimizing 
human disturbance;

than a single or few species;

o  Manage state lands to protect all native elements of biodiversity rather 
o  Minimize habitat fragmentation;
o  Develop a management plan for each state land holding that outlines 
conservation strategies that address principle threats to biodiversity;
o  Promote wise recreational use on state lands compatible with regional 
biodiversity conservation goals and reduce existing conflicts between 
recreation and biodiversity conservation;

o  Target, monitor, and evaluate road and highway construction and other 
infrastructure projects to ensure that sensitive areas and species are 
avoided and protected on state lands.  Promote the use of NY Natural 
Heritage Program and other biological data by state agencies overseeing 
proposed projects and activities to direct growth and development away 
from critical areas of biodiversity on state lands;

o  Incorporate habitat considerations into right-of-way management 

programs. Use native plant species in plantings on public lands (e.g. 
highway medians and shoulders).  Schedule maintenance on state lands 
to avoid negative effects on nesting or migratory species (e.g., delayed 
mowing);

of state lands that have important elements or areas of biodiversity;

o  Upgrade conservation status (e.g. stewardship rank as outlined in Table 2) 
o  Retrofit roadways, culverts, drains, and fences to allow for the natural 
o  Facilitate public understanding of the role of public lands in conserving 

migration of reptiles and amphibians;

biodiversity; and

120

o  Support programs that help municipal parks and non-profit preserves 
to identify habitats and manage them in a regional context, including 
conservation of sensitive areas, removal of invasive and exotic species, 
restoration of native plant communities, and management where 
appropriate.

	 Control of Invasive & Overabundant Species:

Several invasive exotic plant species have become established in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor, including purple loosestrife, common reed, and water chestnut.  
When these plants form monotypic stands the result can be an overall decrease in the 
biodiversity of an area, most often in biodiversity rich wetlands.

To date, the Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program has focused on efforts to 
control purple loosestrife in the Hudson River Valley.  Biological control of purple 
loosestrife appears promising, however the control effort is still undergoing evalua-
tion by NYSDEC and Cornell University.  The biological control agents being tested 
include a root-boring weevil and two leaf-eating beetles.  A spectral fingerprint was 
developed for purple loosestrife, cattail, and common reed (using remote sensing 
and GIS analysis) and will be used to map stands of loosestrife in the Lower Hudson 
River Valley (Richmond et al. 2002). 

The development of management plans for other invasive species in the Hudson 
River Valley should be a priority.  Additionally, research on ecological relationships 
and impacts of invasive species is needed to provide a sound basis for management 
decisions.  Research and management activities could be directed at invasive plant 
and animal species such as water chestnut, common reed, mute swan, hemlock woolly 
adelgid, and the zebra mussel.  Initial research efforts should focus on understanding 
the abundance and distribution of invasive species and their interaction with and ef-
fects on native plants and animals.  Using this information, species-specific manage-
ment plans can be developed and implemented.

Overabundant wildlife species can have a profound influence on local and regional 
biodiversity.  White-tailed deer are perhaps the best example of a species that can 
dramatically alter its habitat.  Deer over-browsing changes the composition, diversity, 
and abundance of plant communities and associated wildlife species. Furthermore, 
deer over-browsing can negatively affect rare plant species. 

Current deer densities in the Hudson River Valley are generally high.  In areas where 
deer densities are negatively affecting tree regeneration or threatening a rare plant or 
community, management plans should be developed on a site-specific basis.  Manage-
ment plans should stem from a monitoring program designed to track changes in the 
composition, diversity, and abundance of native plant communities. The use of deer 
exclosures can be a useful tool to monitor and demonstrate the effects of over-brows-
ing at various deer densities.  Because the NYSDEC has the authority to manage 
white-tailed deer in the state, efforts to promote management on a site-specific basis 

121

(incorporating biodiversity concerns) should be encouraged.  Areas that have medium 
to high deer densities and that contain rare plant communities should be prioritized 
for a monitoring and management program.

 

Strategies for control of invasive & overabundant species:

o  Continue applied research to develop invasive species control methods;
o  Manually remove invasive species and replace with native species;
o  Develop management plans for invasive and overabundant species; 
o  Monitor trends in invasive and overabundant species;
o  Encourage natural landscaping.

	 Reducing Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:

Habitat loss and fragmentation on public and private lands is probably the most sig-
nificant threat to biodiversity in the Hudson River Estuary corridor.  Fragmentation 
of large habitat areas into smaller sections can lead to the local extirpation of area-
dependent species.  Fragmentation might also interrupt species migrations.  Newly 
created habitat types can form a barrier to species that are not adapted to survive in 
that type.  In particular, roads form a barrier that raises mortality and blocks migration 
for some species.  Reptile and amphibian species are especially susceptible to being 
killed while crossing roads.

Many types of disturbance can lead to the loss or degradation of habitats.  Activities 
such as residential, commercial, industrial and municipal development; road building; 
gravel pit mining; agricultural clearing; logging; and power line cutting can threaten 
natural communities and populations by eliminating and fragmenting habitat, and by 
disrupting crucial ecological processes and functions.  These activities provide entry 
points for invasive, exotic species.  Alterations to and manipulations of existing hy-
drologic regimes and water levels can adversely affect wetland communities and spe-
cies requiring wetland habitat.  Hydrologic disturbances include damming, removal of 
man-made or beaver dams, ditch draining, irrigation pumping, dredging, and filling.

Many plant, animal, and natural community occurrences on protected lands are threat-
ened by trampling and erosion caused by off-road vehicles, motorcycles, boat ramp 
activities, dirt bikes, horses, rock climbers, hikers, birdwatchers, and photographers.  
Invasion by exotic species often follows these activities.  Those seeking to experience 
natural areas can inadvertently disturb sensitive species and rare plant populations and 
their habitat along scenic trails and mountain summits.

Other issues facing land managers include fire suppression, which affects communi-
ties and associated species dependent on open canopy habitats, collecting of commer-
cially valuable plant and animal species, illegal killing of feared or unwanted wildlife, 
protection of old-growth forests, and grass mowing and other clearing activities that 
threaten species in cemeteries, airports, parks, golf courses, abandoned farm fields, 
and along streams.  In some cases, mowing can benefit species, but the timing of such 
activities and the size of the open area are crucial to the success of the species.

122

The vulnerability of habitats to disruption in the Hudson River Estuary corridor was 
assessed using a model of projected residential development (Smith et al. 2004).  This 
model is based on physical constraints and the stage of a housing neighborhood in its 
life-cycle (i.e., single-family subdivisions, multi-family dwellings, or areas under 
renewal) within a census blockgroup area.  The results of the models predictions are 
shown in Figure 15.  The areas identified as possessing a high probability of future 
residential development represent 59% of the total land area in the Hudson River 
Estuary corridor.  These areas include, or are adjacent to, 48% of the land area cur-
rently under some form of public or private conservation management (much of the 
public land areas are not actually available to residential development).  Over 86% 
percent of the land areas within the highly vulnerable to development (high-ranking) 
category have no long-term conservation mechanism (governmental or legal). These 
high-ranking areas have total species richness values (measured by total species 
count) ranging from 86 to 147.  The highest species richness reported for any area in 
the Hudson River Estuary corridor is 151 out of a potential 308 (Smith et al. 2001).  
The average species count of 130 for the high-ranking areas highlights the conflict 
between maintaining wildlife habitat and providing for human habitat expansion.

Given the tremendous pressures on the biological diversity of the Hudson River Val-
ley, the full range of conservation tools will be required to effectively address the 
loss and fragmentation of the significant habitats presented in Part II.  Conservation 
strategies and actions described in this section include land acquisition (on a volun-
tary, willing-seller basis), conservation easements, outreach, education, legislation, 
cooperative land agreements, and tax incentives.

 

Strategies for reducing habitat loss and fragmentation:

appropriate for the presentation of species and processes;

o  Identify unfragmented core habitat areas and habitat corridors at scales 
o  Reclaim the best possible minimum thresholds of habitat connectivity 
through restoration efforts where fragmentation has already occurred;
o  Provide land stewardship incentives to landowners, non-profits, sporting 
clubs, and others and advise them on desirable management practices 
(e.g., provide greater tax incentives for owners to keep property in forest 
management);

a willing-seller, willing-buyer basis;

o  Acquire land and conservation easements for protection and public use on 
o  Advance opportunities for wildlife-related recreation (e.g., hunting, 
o  Support the viability of forestry and agriculture compatible with 
o  Provide information and support to local planning boards to incorporate                         

birdwatching, and other pursuits);

biodiversity conservation;

biodiversity considerations into land use decisions consistent with local 
home rule;

o  Promote the conservation and restoration of habitats considered most 

significant for biodiversity conservation in the region (e.g., restore tidal

structures; conduct controlled burning or mowing on early successional 
habitats; identify and buffer vernal pools and freshwater wetlands; reduce 
livestock use of riparian areas; and restore native plant communities); 
o  Develop site-specific strategies for significant habitats and biodiversity 

areas.

	 Pollution Control:

Sources of pollutants include permitted or illegal point sources, such as failing mu-
nicipal and industrial wastewater systems, toxic dumps, and leaking landfills; and 
nonpoint sources such as petrochemicals, pathogens, and lawn chemicals transported 
with urban and suburban runoff, agricultural runoff, construction-site runoff, and acid 
or nitrogen-enriched precipitation.

 

Strategies for pollution control:

o  Support continued reduction in air and water pollution in the region;
o  Develop and promote farming and forestry Best Management Practices 
o  Educate homeowners, landowners, and the agricultural community about 

the impacts of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on wildlife species.

(BMPs);

Program Area:
Education

Education strategies address a variety of threats to biodiversity and can be implemented 
at a variety of levels.  Many education strategies address the desire to raise public 
awareness and understanding about biodiversity issues and the need for conservation.  
A general educational goal is to increase understanding of biodiversity conservation in 
the Hudson River Estuary corridor and promote the utilization of conservation tools in 
local land-use planning and land stewardship by property owners, communities, local 
governments, and land trusts.

Many local governments (county, town, city, and village), land trusts, and communities 
desire more information and assistance with biodiversity conservation.  The Hudson 
River Estuary Biodiversity Program has partnered with other organizations to develop 
several tools for biodiversity conservation, including a New York Natural Heritage 
Program database, maps, and conservation guides for biodiversity element occurrences 
in the Hudson River Estuary corridor, Hudson River Valley Gap Analysis land cover 
and species distribution maps, GIS trainings, and a Biodiversity Assessment Manual 
for the Hudson River Estuary Corridor (Kiviat and Stevens 2001) and related training 
programs.  These tools can be useful to local governments and land trusts for biodiversity 
conservation planning.

As part of the educational process we should promote the interaction between state 
conservation agencies, their partners, and the public.  A positive relationship fosters 

125

cooperation and the coordination of conservation actions. These efforts could involve 
working with:

	

 

local government (village, town, county) decision makers to incorporate biodiversity 
conservation considerations in open space planning, comprehensive planning, and 
SEQRA reviews;
land trusts and land conservation organizations to incorporate biodiversity 
conservation considerations into land acquisition and land management planning;

  Hudson River Valley citizens and communities to value biodiversity and support local 

efforts to conserve biodiversity during open space planning, master planning, and 
SEQRA reviews;

  Cornell Cooperative Extension and other outreach specialists to increase participation 

in biodiversity outreach efforts; and
agricultural and forestry operation managers, owners, and workers to implement Best 
Management Practices (BMPs) that promote biodiversity conservation.

 

Educational programs can improve understanding of biodiversity and its importance, 
provide training on the use of conservation tools, assist in the identification of priority 
sites for conservation, provide educational opportunities on public lands, increase the 
availability of biodiversity information, improve understanding of how cooperative land 
agreements can be used to benefit wildlife and wildlife habitat, and promote individual 
and community involvement in biodiversity conservation.
  Strategies for biodiversity education:

and town planning boards;

inventory, and monitoring;

o  Educate the public on biodiversity issues and the need for conservation;
o  Encourage and facilitate community involvement in biodiversity conservation, 
o  Make biodiversity information available to citizens, local officials, and county 
o  Encourage biodiversity sensitivity in land-use decision making;
o  Partner with schools to raise awareness and understanding;
o  Provide training on and assistance with conservation tools to communities, 
o  Promote opportunities for children to experience the outdoors and explore the 

local governments, and land trusts; 

regions natural resources.

	   Biodiversity Outreach and Technical Assistance Program:

A biodiversity outreach and technical assistance program was established to increase 
understanding of biodiversity conservation in the Hudson River Estuary corridor and 
the utilization of conservation tools in local land-use planning and land stewardship.  
The program provides a critical link between NYSDEC staff and its partners and local 
governments and land trusts.  The early successes of this program have illustrated the 
importance of working on an individual basis with partnering communities.

126

Initial outreach efforts have been with towns that are updating their comprehensive 
planning process, and county agencies that are involved in land management (e.g., 
parks departments) and those working on open space plans, and land trusts.  Towns 
are best able to integrate biodiversity considerations during the land use planning 
process because it lays the groundwork for zoning and local law changes.  Assistance 
to towns and counties includes biodiversity seminars, information and data gathering, 
assistance with grant applications, and promoting effective land use tools to protect 
natural resources.  As the Outreach and Technical Assistance Program expands, ef-
forts will likely include audiences such as businesses, educators, and special interest 
groups (e.g., environmental organizations, farm and forestry associations, and sports-
mens federations).

Objectives of the biodiversity outreach and technical assistance program include:

1.  Define information and technical assistance needs of land trusts, 

communities, landowners, and local governments engaged in open space 
and comprehensive planning;

2.  Assist local governments, land trusts, and landowners with incorporating 

biodiversity conservation considerations into decision making;

3.  Assist and train local governments, land trusts, and landowners in the use 
and application of available data, information, and tools for biodiversity 
conservation;

4.  Provide biodiversity information for communities and local decision-

makers; and

5.  Work with other outreach specialists to promote Best Management 

Practices (BMPs) for biodiversity. 

 

 
Outreach to local governments in the Hudson Valley began in 2001 as a partnership 
between DEC, Cornell University, Hudsonia, Ltd., and the Metropolitan Conservation 
Alliance (a program of the Wildlife Conservation Society).  These entities coordinate 
closely with each other to provide integrated outreach and technical assistance to 
intended audiences.  By working collaboratively, the Biodiversity Program is able to 
increase the breadth and depth of the outreach program.

Hudsonias outreach efforts promote use of the Biodiversity Assessment Manual for 
the Hudson River Estuary Corridor (Kiviat and Stevens 2001).  Community groups 
(including town planning board and conservation advisory council members) are 
trained to use the Biodiversity Assessment Manual to identify and map habitats in 
their area of jurisdiction.  Each group develops new information on ecologically 
significant habitats that can help municipal governments with land use planning and 
SEQR reviews. 

A project by the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance includes biological surveys for 
indicator species, as well as developing and promoting the use of land-use tools to 
conserve functioning ecological systems.  Initial efforts are focusing on 18 towns in 

127

Westchester, Putnam, Orange and Ulster Counties. Outreach to towns includes slide 
presentations; presentation and interpretation of field survey data; and assistance with 
planning tools such as master plans, open space studies, ordinances, overlay districts, 
and zoning changes.   Outreach also includes interaction with landowners who have 
granted permission to access their property for biological surveys.

The Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Program is also partnering with Cornell Exten-
sion in development of a community-based Biodiversity Program Work Team for the 
Hudson River Valley.  An Extension biodiversity workshop and mini-grants program 
supports local biodiversity conservation efforts in collaboration with County Coopera-
tive Extension offices. 

More information on current outreach and technical assistance efforts can be obtained 
by contacting the Hudson River Estuary Program Biodiversity Outreach Coordinator 
at the Hudson River Estuary Program office address provided in the Overview of this
